MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINACNIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis presents management's view of our business, financial condition and overall performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this filing. Our discussion and analysis consists of the following subjects:\n\u2022Executive Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Unrestricted Subsidiary Information\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Environmental Regulation\n\u2022Related Party Transactions\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Standards\nAs used in this Item 7, unless the context otherwise requires: \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us\" and the \"Partnership\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. and, where the context requires, our subsidiaries. References to \"NRP\" and \"Natural Resource Partners\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. only, and not to NRP (Operating) LLC or any of Natural Resource Partners L.P.'s subsidiaries. References to \"Opco\" refer to NRP (Operating) LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP, and its subsidiaries. References to NRP Oil and Gas refer to NRP Oil and Gas LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP. NRP Finance Corporation (\"NRP Finance\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP and a co-issuer with NRP on the 9.125% senior notes.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, crude oil and natural gas, construction aggregates, frac sand and other natural resources. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"NRP\". The information presented in Item 7. reflects the one-for-ten reverse unit split that was effective on February 17, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded revenues and other income of $488.8 million, and a net loss of $571.7 million. During 2015, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, which we consider to be the critical measures in evaluating our operating performance, met or exceeded the guidance issued to the public markets in February 2015, as revised in August 2015. Despite the rapidly deteriorating coal and oil and gas markets in 2015, we recorded Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 of $292.1 million, which was essentially flat compared to our Adjusted EBITDA in 2014, and Distributable Cash Flow of $197.0 million, which exceeded expectations and was down only 5% compared to 2014. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA.\" For a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow.\" Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provide information useful in assessing our segment financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, respectively.\nOur business is organized into four operating segments:\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other-consists primarily of coal royalty, coal related transportation and processing assets, aggregate and industrial minerals royalty assets and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across the United States.\nSoda Ash-consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.\nVantaCore-consists of our construction materials business acquired in October 2014 that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. VantaCore operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana.\nOil and Gas-consists of our non-operated working interests, royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties. Our primary interests in oil and natural gas producing properties are non-operated working interests located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. We also own fee mineral, royalty or overriding royalty interests in oil and gas properties in several other regions, including the Appalachian Basin, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\nCurrent Liquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $64.8 million of liquidity that consisted of $51.8 million in cash and $13.0 million in combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our debt by a net amount of $91.0 million. Opco's $300.0 million revolving credit facility matures in October 2017, and as of December 31, 2015, we had $290.0 million outstanding thereunder. We borrowed $75.0 million under Opco's revolving credit facility in September 2015 in order to repay Opco's term loan in full. In October 2015, the borrowing base under the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility was redetermined to $88.0 million, and we repaid $15.0 million under that credit facility, reducing our outstanding borrowings thereunder to $85.0 million. As of the date of this report, the combined borrowing capacity under our two revolving credit facilities is $13.0 million.\nIn February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27%, or 139 million tons, of our hard mineral reserves as of December 31, 2015 for $10.0 million in cash. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves, or 1,094 MBoe, as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt.\nWe have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on Opco's senior notes each year through 2018, and our operating results continue to be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. In April 2015, we announced a long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the partnership for future growth. As part of that plan, we reduced our cash distributions with respect to the first and second quarters of 2015 to $0.90 per common unit (giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse unit split effective on February 17, 2016), a 75% decrease from the distribution paid with respect to fourth quarter of 2014. In October 2015, the Board further reduced the distribution to $0.45 per common unit (giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse unit split effective on February 17, 2016) with respect to the third quarter of 2015, representing an additional 50% reduction in the distribution paid with respect to the second quarter of 2015. The cash savings resulting from the distribution reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We have also taken steps to reduce general and administrative and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts. However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our deleveraging objectives and have determined to sell certain assets to help meet these objectives. While we have closed two asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected.\nCurrent Results/Market Outlook\nCoal, Hard Minerals Royalty and Other Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Coal, Hard Minerals Royalty and Other business segment contributed revenues and other income of $246.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $204.6 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $212.2 million. Our revenues and other income from the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment represented 51% of our total revenues and other income in 2015, as compared to 64% of total revenues and other income in 2014, in part due to revenues reported for a full year of ownership of VantaCore. Although our total revenues and other income for 2015 increased over 2014, our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other revenues were down 4% compared to the same period. The majority of this decrease was due to lower coal prices in each of the Appalachian regions during the period and in the Illinois Basin as a result primarily of lower coal production during the period. This decrease in coal royalty revenues was partially offset by an increase in other coal related revenues, which increased 82% over the 2014 period, due to increased minimums recognized as revenue, increases in gains recognized on coal reserve swaps, condemnation payments and the receipt of lease assignment fees.\nBoth the thermal and metallurgical coal markets remain severely challenged, and we do not anticipate that either market will recover in the near term. We expect that coal producers will continue to cut production and idle additional mines in response to market conditions, but we do not know to what extent our properties may be affected. A number of coal producers have filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and additional producers may file for bankruptcy. Historically, our leases have generally been assumed and all pre-petition bankruptcy amounts have been cured in full in our lessees' bankruptcy processes, but we have no assurance this will continue in the future. In October 2015, Patriot Coal Corporation completed the sale of its assets in accordance with its bankruptcy plan. All of our leases were assumed and assigned in the sale process, and we received full pre-petition cure payments. Alpha Natural Resources (\"Alpha\"), which is our second largest lessee, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Alpha has continued operating and paying royalties to us following the bankruptcy filing. However, Alpha has reduced production and idled certain mines, and we expect that Alpha will continue to reduce production and/or idle mines during its bankruptcy process. Production cuts and mine idlings by Alpha have resulted in and would continue to result in decreased royalty payments to us to the extent such production cuts or idlings are on our properties. We estimate that Alpha owes us approximately $3.2 million in pre-petition royalties and minimum payments, and we expect to receive pre-petition amounts due to us with respect to any leases that are assumed in the bankruptcy process. Arch Coal, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016. While we do not yet know whether our leases will be assumed or rejected in Arch's bankruptcy process, our overall exposure to Arch is immaterial.\nWhile producers of Central Appalachian thermal coal have struggled for an extended period due to the high cost nature of their operations, production from our Illinois Basin properties also decreased by 15% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Part of the decrease in production from our Illinois Basin properties is attributable to the idling of Foresight Energy's (\"Foresight Energy\") Deer Run mine (which we also refer to as our Hillsboro property) as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine beginning in March 2015. In July 2015, we received a notice from Foresight Energy declaring a resulting force majeure event at the Deer Run mine. While we have filed a lawsuit disputing Foresight Energy's claim of force majeure, the effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to pay us quarterly minimum deficiency payments with respect to the Deer Run mine until mining resumes. Under the lease for the Deer Run mine, Foresight Energy is required to make minimum deficiency payments to us of $7.5 million per quarter, or $30.0 million per year. The amount payable to us as the minimum deficiency payment with respect to any quarter is reduced by the amount of coal royalties actually paid to us for tonnage sold at the mine with respect to that quarter. We received royalty payments on tonnage sold from coal stockpiles at the Deer Run mine during the second and third quarters of 2015, but royalty payments from tonnage sold with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly declined and we expect that the stockpiles will be depleted early in the first quarter of 2016. Foresight Energy's failure to make the deficiency payments with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 resulted in a negative cash impact to us of $16.2 million. Such amount will increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled. We do not know when, or if, mining activities at the Deer Run mine will recommence.\nThe metallurgical coal markets continued to deteriorate during 2015, and the metallurgical coal benchmark price for the first quarter of 2016 was set at a new multi-year low. We derived approximately 38% of our coal royalty revenues and 30% of the related production from metallurgical coal during 2015. The global metallurgical coal market continues to suffer from oversupply driven in part by reduced demand from China. Domestic coal producers are also burdened by the effects of the relatively strong U.S. dollar, which increases the production cost of domestic coal producers relative to foreign producers.\nSoda Ash Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Soda Ash business segment contributed revenues and other income of $49.9 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $46.8 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $43.0 million. Our trona mining and soda ash refinery investment performed in line with our expectations in 2015 with record soda ash production volumes. During 2015, the international market for soda ash weakened somewhat due to softer pricing, but Ciner Wyoming's international sales were consistent with expectations. Domestic sales volumes, which are typically sold at higher prices than soda ash sold internationally, have remained relatively stable. The cash we receive from Ciner Wyoming is in part determined by the quarterly distributions declared by Ciner Resources LP. In February 2016, Ciner Resources LP paid a quarterly distribution of $0.5575 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 1% over the distribution paid with respect to the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 5% over the distribution paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nVantaCore Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our VantaCore business segment contributed revenues and other income of $139.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $22.1 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $18.8 million.\nVantaCore's construction aggregates mining and production business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves and is also seasonal, with lower production and sales expected during the first quarter of each year due to winter weather. VantaCore's Laurel Aggregates operation in southwestern Pennsylvania serves producers and oilfield service companies operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and was impacted during 2015 by the slowing pace of exploration and development of natural gas in those areas due to low natural gas prices. Increased local construction activity partially offset these declines during 2015, but we expect that Laurel's business will continue to be impacted by decreased natural gas development activities. VantaCore's operations based in Clarksville, Tennessee and Baton Rouge, Louisiana depend on the pace of commercial and residential construction in those areas. The Clarksville operation performed above expectations during 2015, while the Baton Rouge operation volumes were lower than expected. In June 2015, VantaCore purchased a hard rock quarry operation located on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, Kentucky from one of NRP's aggregates lessees that had previously idled the operation. This operation continues to lease reserves from NRP and sells its produced limestone aggregates in both the local market and downstream to river-based markets.\nOil and Gas Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Oil and Gas business segment contributed revenues and other income of $53.6 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $31.0 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $24.6 million. Revenues in our Oil and Gas business segment decreased year-over year primarily due to a decline in oil prices, partially offset by increased production volumes.\nGlobal oil prices continued to decline in 2015 and remained significantly lower than 2014, and prices have continued to decline in the first quarter of 2016. Although domestic crude oil production has shown signs of decline, inventories remain above the five-year average indicating continued excessive supply. Production of crude is estimated to continue to decline as a result of reduced development drilling activities. Natural gas prices have also shown recent declines due to reduced demand and increased inventories. Our oil and gas revenues will continue to fluctuate with changes in prices for oil and natural gas and are expected to decrease over time due to natural production declines in producing wells and significantly decreased drilling activity. As of the date of this filing, we have not hedged any of our future oil or natural gas production.\nManagement's Forecast and Strategic Plan\nOpco's revolving credit facility matures in October 2017 and NRP's 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April 2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. Through February 2016, we completed asset sales for $47.5 million in gross proceeds. However, we believe the deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals. Traditionally, we have accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have the ability to access either the debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of companies\nwith coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.\nWhile NRP has a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable operations with positive operating cash flows, its operating results and credit metrics continue to be impacted by demand challenges for coal and excess worldwide supply of oil and gas. In particular, as described in \"Note 10. Debt and Debt-Affiliate\" in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the agreements governing the outstanding debt of NRP Oil and Gas and Opco contain customary financial covenants, including maintenance covenants, and other restrictive covenants. In addition, NRP has issued $425 million of 9.125% Senior Notes, that are governed by an indenture (\"the Indenture\") containing customary incurrence-based financial covenants and other covenants, but not maintenance covenants. The following discussion presents management's outlook and strategic plan to address its debt covenant compliance.\nOpco and NRP\nAs of December 31, 2015, Opco had $290.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility due October 2017 (the \"Opco Credit Facility\") and $585.9 million outstanding under several series of Private Placement Notes (the \"Opco Private Placement Notes\") (collectively referred to as the \"Opco Debt agreements\"). The maximum leverage ratio under the Opco Debt agreements is required to be below 4.0x through March 31, 2016. Commencing with respect to the period ended June 30, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio reduces to 3.75x and reduces again to 3.5x commencing with respect to the period ended June 30, 2017. In addition, the Opco Debt agreements contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco's ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Opco was in compliance with and we forecast that Opco will continue to remain in compliance through December 31, 2016 with the covenants contained in its debt agreements. In addition, we believe Opco has sufficient liquidity to make all regularly scheduled principal and interest payments through December 31, 2016. We are currently pursuing or considering a number of actions including (i) dispositions of assets, (ii) actively managing our debt capital structure through a number of potential alternatives, including exchange offers and non-traditional debt financing, (iii) minimizing our capital expenditures, (iv) obtaining waivers or amendments from our lenders, (v) effectively managing our working capital and (vi) improving our cash flows from operations. While we forecast that we will be in compliance with all of the covenants under the Opco Debt agreements through December 31, 2016, our forecast is sensitive to commodity pricing and counterparty risk. Accordingly, we intend to pursue one or more of the alternatives discussed above in order to mitigate the effects of further commodity price and market deterioration which could otherwise cause us to breach financial covenants under the Opco Debt agreements. Breaches of the Opco Debt agreement covenants that are not waived or cured, to the extent possible, would result in an event of default under the Opco Debt agreements, and if such debt is accelerated by the lenders thereunder, such acceleration would also result in a cross-default under the Indenture.\nNRP Oil and Gas\nNRP Oil and Gas had $85.0 million outstanding under its senior secured, reserve-based revolving credit facility (the \"RBL Facility\") as of December 31, 2015. The facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of NRP Oil and Gas's assets and is not guaranteed by NRP or any other subsidiary of NRP. Due to the significant and sustained decline in oil prices since the end of 2014, we forecast that NRP Oil and Gas may not be able to remain in compliance with the 3.5x leverage ratio as required in the RBL Facility during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect that, due to current oil and gas prices, the next borrowing base redetermination under the RBL Facility that is scheduled to occur in May 2016 may result in a reduction of the borrowing base by an amount that would exceed NRP Oil and Gas's ability to repay principal within the required time-frame following such redetermination. In addition, the RBL Facility requires the entity to provide annual financial statements that include a report from its independent registered public accounting firm with an opinion that does not contain \"a \"going concern\" or like qualification or exception.\" Any of these events would qualify as an event of default and would provide the RBL Facility lenders with the ability to accelerate the debt outstanding under the RBL Facility to the extent not waived or cured. While we are attempting to take appropriate mitigating actions, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to amending, refinancing, extending the maturity or curing potential defaults in the RBL Facility will be sufficient, and we may be required to sell some or all of the assets of NRP Oil and Gas, raise new equity capital at NRP Oil and Gas or pursue restructuring alternatives. As a result, we believe there is substantial doubt about the ability of NRP Oil and Gas to continue as a going concern through December 31, 2016. As we\nwere in compliance with all covenants contained in the RBL Facility throughout 2015 and at December 31, 2015, we have classified this debt as non-current in accordance with its terms.\nAn event of default under the RBL facility and subsequent acceleration of that debt by the lenders thereunder would not result in a cross-default under the Indenture. NRP Oil and Gas is designated as an \"Unrestricted Subsidiary\" for purposes of the Indenture, which prevents an event of default under the RBL Facility and subsequent acceleration of that debt from triggering an event of default under the Indenture. In addition, there are no cross-defaults under the Opco Debt agreements as a result of defaults under the RBL Facility. As a result, there would be no default or acceleration of indebtedness under the Indenture or under the Opco Debt agreements in the event NRP Oil and Gas is in default under its RBL Facility.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $2.5 million, or 1%, from $294.6 million in 2014 to $292.1 million in 2015. The decrease is mainly related to declines in our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and Oil and Gas business segments year-over-year, partially offset by higher income from our VantaCore business that was acquired in October 2014. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\" for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and see below for our Adjusted EBITDA by business segment and a reconciliation to net income

in 2014 to $197.0 million in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to a reduction in cash provided by our coal operations, partially offset by our VantaCore business that was acquired in October 2014. Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6.

Total coal royalty revenues decreased $40.2 million, or 22%, from $184.2 million in 2014 to $144.0 million in 2015. Coal prices continue to be depressed, which has negatively affected our coal related revenues. Further declines or a continued low price environment could have an additional adverse effect on our coal related revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, total coal production and total coal royalty revenues were down in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Gulf Coast, while\nwe saw a significant increase in the Northern Powder River Basin. All Appalachian regions saw a decrease in coal royalty revenues during the year with coal royalty revenues in Northern Appalachia down 69% despite a 2% increase in production from that area. We saw a decrease in the average coal revenue per ton throughout all of our regions, with the exception of the Gulf Coast whose average coal revenue per ton remained flat, for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther coal related revenues increased $35.0 million, or 82%, from $42.5 million in 2014 to $77.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily a result of two lease assignment fee payments received in 2015 totaling $21.0 million, an $8.8 million increase in minimums recognized as revenue, $3.7 million public roadway condemnation payments and a $3.6 million increase in reserve swap gains year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by decreased overriding royalty revenue in 2015.\nHard mineral royalty revenues decreased $4.0 million, or 33%, from $12.1 million in 2014 to $8.1 million in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in minimums recognized as revenues and aggregate royalty revenues.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment increased $8.5 million, or 21%, from $41.4 million in 2014 to $49.9 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to our allocated percentage of Ciner Wyoming's $15.0 million increase in income year-over-year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $46.8 million in cash distributions from Ciner Wyoming and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $46.6 million in cash distributions.\nVantaCore\nTonnage sold by the VantaCore segment increased 5.1 million tons from 2.3 million tons in 2014 to 7.4 million tons in 2015. Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment increased $96.9 million, or 231%, from $42.1 million in 2014 to $139.0 million in 2015. This increase is due to the fact that VantaCore was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOil and Gas\nRevenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment decreased $6.0 million, or 10%, from $59.6 million in 2014 to $53.6 million in 2015. This decrease is due to lower commodity prices during the year, partially offset by increased production, primarily as a result of the acquisition of non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin in November 2014.

This increase is primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of VantaCore operating expenses in 2015.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $1.7 million, or 5%, from $34.2 million in 2014 to $32.5 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily related to decreased overhead expenses allocated to the segment, specifically a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in unit price year-over-year.\nVantaCore\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our VantaCore segment increased $78.2 million from $38.7 million in 2014 to $116.9 million in 2015. This increase is due to the fact that 2014 results only include three months of VantaCore activity as compared to twelve months in 2015.\nOil and Gas\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our Oil and Gas segment increased $1.3 million, or 6%, from $21.3 million in 2014 to $22.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to a full year of operating expenses related to the fourth quarter 2014 Sanish Field acquisition, partially offset by decreased overhead as a result of the 2014 consulting expenses related to the acquisition. The average production cost per unit decreased $3.88 per unit, or 30%, from $13.08 per unit in 2014 to $9.20 per unit in 2015.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") Expense\nDD&A expense increased $20.9 million, or 26%, from $79.9 million in 2014 to $100.8 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to a full year of DD&A expense on our VantaCore and Sanish Field assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by decreased DD&A expense as a result of the reduction in our assets basis due to the 2015 asset impairments described below.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nDD&A expense for our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $8.1 million, or 15%, from $52.6 million in 2014 to $44.5 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in depletion expense on the assets that were impaired during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nVantaCore\nDD&A expense for our VantaCore segment increased $12.3 million from $3.3 million in 2014 to $15.6 million in 2015. This increase was due to the fact that 2014 results only include three months of activity as compared to a full year in 2015.\nOil and Gas\nDD&A expense for our Oil and Gas segment increased $16.9 million, or 70%, from $23.9 million in 2014 to $40.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased production as a result of a full year of expense on the assets acquired in the fourth quarter 2014 Sanish Field acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the reduction in asset basis on the assets impaired in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative (including affiliates) (\"G&A\") Expense\nCorporate and financing G&A expense includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs increased $1.8 million, or 17%, from $10.5 million in 2014 to $12.3 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries, bonus and benefits, consulting, rent and legal fees. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in unit price year-over-year.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment expense increased $655.4 million from $26.2 million in 2014 to $681.6 million in 2015.

This increase was primarily due to the significant impairment expense taken in the third quarter 2015. Coal property impairments primarily resulted from idled operations in Appalachia combined with the continued deterioration in the coal markets and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry. Hard mineral royalty property impairments primarily resulted from greenfield development projects that have not performed as projected, leading to recent lease concessions on minimums and royalties combined with the continued regional market decline for certain properties. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized an additional $8.2 million impairment expense on our coal properties as a result of continued market declines and $4.7 million impairment expense related to coal processing and transportation assets as well as obsolete equipment at our Logan office. During the second quarter of 2015 we recorded a $2.3 million impairment expense related to a coal preparation plant. With continued weakness in the commodity markets, we will continue to closely monitor our assets for impairment. It is reasonably possible that our estimate of future net cash flows could change in the near term. If conditions in coal markets continue to deteriorate, it is likely that additional non-cash write-downs of properties would occur in the future.\nVantaCore\nAsset impairment expense related to our VantaCore segment increased from $0.0 million in 2014 to $6.2 million in 2015. The 2015 impairment expense was primarily related to the $5.5 million write off of goodwill as well as a $0.7 million impairment related to obsolete plant and equipment.\nOil and Gas\nAsset impairment expense related to our Oil and Gas segment increased from $0.0 million in 2014 to $367.6 million in 2015. The 2015 impairment expense in our Oil and Gas segment primarily resulted from declines in future expected realized commodity prices and reduced expected drilling activity on our acreage.\nGiven the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term. If oil and natural gas prices decline from the prices used in our impairment analysis, it is likely that additional non-cash write-downs of oil and gas properties will occur in the future. If future capital expenditures are greater than expected or if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserve volumes, our estimate of future net cash flows from oil and natural gas reserves would decrease and non-cash write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties may occur in the future. In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of our oil and gas properties to changes in oil and gas prices, management modeled a 10% change in the forward price curve across the full term of expected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties. This 10% change in oil and gas prices resulted in zero additional non-cash write-downs and an immaterial decline in our oil and natural gas reserve volumes.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $13.6 million, or 17%, from $80.2 million in 2014 to $93.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of additional debt incurred to complete acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $37.6 million, or 11%, from $332.2 million in 2013 to $294.6 million in 2014. This decrease is mainly related to the special distribution of $44.8 million received in 2013 from Ciner Wyoming as well as lower coal related revenues offset by higher earnings from our VantaCore and Oil and Gas business segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6.

to $208.4 million in 2014. This decrease was due primarily to a $44.8 million special distribution received from Ciner Wyoming in 2013, declines in the coal business, and an additional $21.0 million of interest paid in 2014 that resulted in a $36.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operations relative to 2013 and also a $9.5 million difference in proceeds from the sale of assets. Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow\" for an explanation of Distributable Cash Flow and see below for Distributable Cash Flow by business segment and a

production decreased 2.8 million tons, or 5%, from 53.3 million tons in 2013 50.5 million tons in 2014. Total coal royalty revenues decreased $28.5 million, or 13%, from $212.7 million in 2013 to $184.2 million in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, total coal production, total coal royalty revenues and average coal royalty revenue per ton were down in all Appalachia regions. Production in the Illinois Basin remained relatively flat year-over-year; however, total royalty revenues decreased $2.0 million due to a 4% decrease in average royalty revenue per ton. Total coal production, total coal royalty revenues and average royalty revenue per ton remained relatively flat in both the Northern Powder River Basin and the Gulf Coast.\nOther coal related revenues decreased $19.0 million, or 31%, from $61.5 million in 2013 to $42.5 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily a result of a $10.4 million condemnation payment received in 2013 in addition to a $5.8 million decrease in override revenues and a $2.5 million decrease in reserve swap gains year-over-year\nHard mineral royalty revenues decreased $1.4 million, or 10%, from $13.5 million in 2013 to $12.1 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to one of our lessees moving from property on which we receive royalty revenue to property on which we receive overriding royalty revenue and another lessee temporarily idling its operation in early 2014. This decrease was offset by an increase in override revenues of approximately $2.0 million in our overriding royalty revenues from frac sand properties, the remaining increase is due to override revenues increasing on our Washington aggregates property due to a lessee moving from our owned property to an area subject to an override.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment increased $7.2 million, or 21%, from $34.2 million in 2013 to $41.4 million in 2014. This increase was due to improved earnings at Ciner Wyoming in 2014 over 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $46.6 million in cash distributions and for the year ended December 31, 2014 we received $72.9 million in cash, which included a one-time special distribution of $44.8 million.\nVantaCore\nTonnage sold by the VanataCore segment was 2.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment was $42.1 million in 2014. We acquired VantaCore in October 2014.\nOil and Gas\nRevenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment increased $42.5 million from $17.1 million in 2013 to $59.6 million in 2014. This increase is due to a full year of revenues from our non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin that were acquired the second half of 2013. In addition, our 2014 results include revenues attributable to our Sanish Field properties acquired in November 2014.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) increased $52.2 million from $42.0 million in 2013 to $94.2 million in 2014. This increase was primarily the result of expenses related to VantaCore and our Sanish Field operations, which were both acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $15.5 million, or 24%, from $64.4 million in 2013 to $79.9 million in 2014. This increase was due to a full year depletion on the oil and gas assets acquired in the second half of 2013 as well as the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on the VantaCore and Sanish Field assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative (including affiliates)\nCorporate and financing G&A expenses include corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs decreased $4.2 million, or 28%, from $14.7 million in 2013 to $10.5 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in our unit price.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment expense increased $25.5 million from $0.7 million in 2013 to $26.2 million in 2014. This increase is due to the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment's impairment of $19.8 million related to its mineral rights, $5.6 million related to its intangible assets and $0.8 million related to its plant and equipment in 2014. The Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment recorded a $0.7 million impairment related to its mineral rights in 2013.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $15.8 million, or 25%, from $64.4 million in 2013 to $80.2 million in 2014. Interest expense increased due to additional debt incurred in 2014 and 2013 to fund acquisitions as well as a refinancing of our credit facility and payment on our term loan with 9.125% high yield notes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $64.8 million of liquidity that consisted of $51.8 million in cash and $13.0 million in combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our debt by a net amount of $91.0 million. Opco's $300.0 million revolving credit facility matures in October 2017, and as of December 31, 2015, we had $290.0 million outstanding thereunder. We borrowed $75.0 million under Opco's revolving credit facility in September 2015 in order to repay Opco's term loan in full. In October, 2015, the borrowing base under the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility was redetermined to $88.0 million, and we repaid $15.0 million under that facility, reducing our outstanding borrowings under that facility to $85.0 million. As of the date of this report, the combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities is $13.0 million.\nIn February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27%, or 139 million tons, of our hard mineral reserves as of December 31, 2015 for $10.0 million in cash. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves, or 1,094 MBoe, as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our current financial needs, we have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on Opco's senior notes each year through 2018, and our operating results continue to be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. In April 2015, we announced a long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the partnership for future growth. As part of that plan, we reduced our cash distributions during 2015 by over 87%. The cash savings resulting from the distribution reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We have also taken steps to reduce general and administrative and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts. However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our delevraging objectives and have determined to sell certain assets to help meet these objectives. While we have closed two asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected. For a more complete discussion of factors that will affect our liquidity, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nOpco's revolving credit facility matures in October 2017 and NRP's 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April 2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. Through February 2016, we completed asset sales for $47.5 million in gross proceeds. However, we believe the deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals. Traditionally, we have accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have the ability to access either the debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of companies with coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.\nGenerally, we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations. Our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $15.5 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to $80.8 million in principal payments\non Opco's senior notes due over the next year. Excluding these principal payments, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $65.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures, other than for acquisitions, have historically been minimal. However, as a result of our Sanish Field oil and gas and VantaCore aggregates acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014, our operating capital expenditures have been higher in 2015. In response to the significant decline in oil price, we expect our oil and gas capital expenditures to decline significantly in 2016 as compared to 2015. A portion of the capital expenditures associated with both our oil and gas working interest business and VantaCore are maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the long-term production capacity of those businesses. We deduct maintenance capital expenditures when calculating distributable cash flow. Total capital expenditures for NRP Oil and Gas for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $30.5 million. We continue to monitor the development programs of the operators of these properties and manage the capital expenditures associated with those properties by only participating in wells that are expected to provide acceptable economic returns. VantaCore's capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.0 million.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $203.4 million, $210.8 million and $247.1 million, respectively. The majority of our cash provided by operations is generated from coal royalty revenues, our equity interest in Ciner Wyoming as well as VantaCore and oil and gas revenues.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $30.3 million, $520.5 million and $302.8 million, respectively. During 2015 our investing activities primarily consisted of well participation costs within our Oil and Gas segment and plant and equipment acquisitions within our VantaCore segment. These 2015 investing cash outflows were partially offset by various asset sales including an aggregate preparation plant, cell phone tower lease contracts and condemnation payments within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment as well as sales of mineral rights within our Oil and Gas segment. Our 2014 investing activities consisted of our Sanish Field and VantaCore acquisitions, the $5.0 million Illinois Basin coal acquisition completed in June 2014, as well as additional capital expenditures related to the participation in new wells in connection with our Williston Basin non-operated oil and gas working interest properties. Our 2013 investing activities consisted of the acquisitions of the interest in Ciner Wyoming and two acquisitions of non-operated working interests in oil and gas properties located in the Williston Basin.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $171.5 million and net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $267.3 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.2 million. During 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had proceeds from loans of $100.0 million, $637.4 million and $567.0 million, respectively. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, these proceeds were offset by repayment of debt of $191.0 million, $328.0 million and $386.2 million, respectively. Also during 2015, 2014 and 2013 we paid cash distributions to our unitholders of $71.8 million, $162.0 million and $246.5 million, respectively. During 2014, we had net proceeds from an issuance of common units of $122.8 million, together with a capital contribution from our general partner of $3.2 million. During 2013, we had net proceeds from an issuance of common units of $74.7 million, together with a capital contribution from our general partner of $1.5 million.\nCapital Resources and Obligations\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had the following indebtedness (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and debt-affiliate, net\n</td> <td>1,304,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,394,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and debt-affiliate, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,384,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,475,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe were and continue to be in compliance with the terms of the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements.

We paid $0.5 million and $3.8 million of consideration in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015, respectively, in satisfaction of our obligations under this agreement with respect to 2013 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate, and have recorded $7.2 million as the amount that will be payable in the first quarter of 2016 with respect to 2015. We have no obligation to pay contingent consideration with respect to any period after 2015.\nIn March 2014, Anadarko gave us written notice that it believed certain reorganization transactions conducted in 2013 within the OCI organization triggered an acceleration of our obligation to pay the additional contingent consideration in full and demanded immediate payment of such amount. We disagreed with Anadarko's position in a written response provided to Anadarko in April 2014. In April 2015, Anadarko sent a written request for additional information regarding the OCI reorganization and indicated that they are still considering this claim against us. We do not believe the reorganization transactions triggered an obligation to pay the additional contingent consideration. We responded in writing in May 2015, and we will continue to engage in discussions with Anadarko to resolve the issue if necessary. However, if Anadarko were to pursue and prevail on such a claim, we would be required to pay an amount to Anadarko in excess of the amounts already paid, together with the $7.2 million accrual described above, up to the maximum amount of the additional contingent consideration, minus a deductible. Under the purchase agreement, the maximum cumulative amount of additional contingent consideration is an amount equal to the net present value of $50.0 million. Any additional amount paid by us would be considered to be additional acquisition consideration and added to Equity and other unconsolidated investments and would reduce our liquidity.\nShelf Registration Statement\nIn September 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of common units.\nUnrestricted Subsidiary Information\nIn February 2016, NRP designated NRP Oil and Gas as an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture. In addition, BRP LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Coval Leasing Company, LLC, are also Unrestricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the reporting period. See \"Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Partnership's significant accounting policies. The following critical accounting policies are affected by estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenues\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other Revenues. Coal and hard mineral royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of mineral sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of mineral they sell. Processing fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material processed through the facilities by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees of the processing facilities make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of material that is processed and sold from the facilities. The processing leases are structured in a manner so that the lessees are responsible for operating and maintenance expenses associated with the facilities. Other revenues\ninclude transportation and processing fees. Transportation fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material transported over the beltlines. Under the terms of the transportation contracts, we receive a fixed price per ton for all material transported on the beltlines.\nSoda Ash Revenues. We account for non-marketable investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, an investee. Significant influence generally exists if we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. We account for our investment in Ciner Wyoming using this method.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and the proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. The basis difference between the investment and the proportional share of the fair value of the underlying net assets of equity method investees is hypothetically allocated first to identified tangible assets and liabilities, then to finite-lived intangibles or indefinite-lived intangibles and the remaining balance is attributed to goodwill. The portion of the basis difference attributed to net tangible assets and finite-lived intangibles is amortized over its estimated useful life while indefinite-lived intangibles, if any, and goodwill are not amortized. The amortization of the basis difference is recorded as a reduction of earnings from the equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOur carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption \"Equity and other unconsolidated investments\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our adjusted share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as revenues and other income under the caption \u2018\u2018Equity and other unconsolidated investment income.\" These earnings are generated from natural resources, which are considered part of our core business activities consistent with its directly owned revenue generating activities. Investee earnings are adjusted to reflect the amortization of any difference between the cost basis of the equity investment and the proportionate share of the investee's book value, which has been allocated to the fair value of net identified tangible and finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over the estimated lives of those assets.\nVantaCore Revenues. Revenues from the sale of aggregates, gravel, sand and asphalt are recorded based upon the transfer of product at delivery to customers, which generally occurs at the quarries or asphalt plants. Revenues from long-term construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. That method is used since we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, which result in revisions to job costs and profits are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Contract costs include all direct job costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, insurance, equipment maintenance and depreciation. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nOil and Gas Revenues. Oil and gas related revenues consist of revenues from our non-operated working interests, royalties and overriding royalties. Revenues related to our non-operated working interests in oil and gas assets are recognized on the basis of our net revenue interests in hydrocarbons produced. We also have capital expenditure and operating expenditure obligations associated with the non-operated working interests. Our revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas, the decline in production from producing wells, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate our wells, including the cost of development and production. Oil and gas royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Also, included within oil and gas royalties are lease bonus payments, which are generally paid upon the execution of a lease.\nDeferred Revenue\nMost of our coal and aggregates lessees must make minimum annual or quarterly payments which are generally recoupable over certain time periods. These minimum payments are recorded as deferred revenue when received. The deferred revenue attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as revenue when the lessee recoups the minimum payment through production or in the period immediately following the expiration of the lessee's ability to recoup the payments.\nLessee Audits and Inspections\nWe periodically audit lessee information by examining certain records and internal reports of our lessees. Our regional managers also perform periodic mine inspections to verify that the information that has been reported to us is accurate. The audit\nand inspection processes are designed to identify material variances from lease terms as well as differences between the information reported to us and the actual results from each property. Audits and inspections, however, are in periods subsequent to when the revenue is reported and any adjustment identified by these processes might be in a reporting period different from when the revenue was initially recorded. Typically there are no material adjustments from this process.\nShare-Based Payment\nWe account for awards relating to our Long-Term Incentive Plan using the fair value method, which requires us to estimate the fair value of the grant, and charge or credit the estimated fair value to expense over the service or vesting period of the grant based on fluctuations in our common unit price. In addition, estimated forfeitures are included in the periodic computation of the fair value of the liability and the fair value is recalculated at each reporting date over the service or vesting period of the grant.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have developed procedures to periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for possible impairment. These procedures are performed throughout the year and are based on historic, current and future performance and are designed to be early warning tests. If an asset fails one of the early warning tests, additional evaluation is performed for that asset that considers both quantitative and qualitative information. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the future expected undiscounted cash flows from its use and disposition is less than the assets' carrying value. Impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value, which is usually determined based upon the present value of the projected future cash flow compared to the assets' carrying value. We believe our estimates of cash flows and discount rates are consistent with those of principal market participants. In addition to the evaluations discussed above, specific events such as a reduction in economically recoverable reserves or production ceasing on a property for an extended period may require a separate impairment evaluation be completed on a significant property. As a result of the continued weakness in the coal markets and the potential for further declines in oil and natural gas prices, we intend to closely monitor our coal and oil and gas assets, and the impairment evaluation process may be completed more frequently if deemed necessary. Future impairment analyses could result in downward adjustments to the carrying value of our assets. During 2015, we recorded impairment expense of $676.1 million on certain of our mineral rights within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and Oil and Gas segments as well as plant and equipment within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and VantaCore segments. For further discussion relating to our 2015 impairments see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 8. Minerals Rights\" and \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Plant and Equipment\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, management compares the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment loss. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, or upon the present value of expected cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nIn accordance with FASB accounting and disclosure guidance for goodwill, we test our recorded goodwill for impairment annually or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist, by determining if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Factors that could trigger an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in our overall business, industry, or economic trends. We recorded a $5.5 million impairment loss related to the VantaCore reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nFor purchase acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques.\nProved Oil and Gas Reserves\nThe Partnership utilizes Netherland Sewell, an independent reserve engineering firm, to estimate its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices are calculated using the unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing and then adjusted for transportation and other costs. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Netherland Sewell in their reserves estimation process.\nThe Partnership's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by Netherland Sewell and our internal staff of petroleum engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the applicable section of \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINACNIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis presents management's view of our business, financial condition and overall performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this filing. Our discussion and analysis consists of the following subjects:\n\u2022Executive Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Unrestricted Subsidiary Information\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Environmental Regulation\n\u2022Related Party Transactions\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Standards\nAs used in this Item 7, unless the context otherwise requires: \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us\" and the \"Partnership\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. and, where the context requires, our subsidiaries. References to \"NRP\" and \"Natural Resource Partners\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. only, and not to NRP (Operating) LLC or any of Natural Resource Partners L.P.'s subsidiaries. References to \"Opco\" refer to NRP (Operating) LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP, and its subsidiaries. References to NRP Oil and Gas refer to NRP Oil and Gas LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP. NRP Finance Corporation (\"NRP Finance\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP and a co-issuer with NRP on the 9.125% senior notes.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, crude oil and natural gas, construction aggregates, frac sand and other natural resources. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"NRP\". The information presented in Item 7. reflects the one-for-ten reverse unit split that was effective on February 17, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded revenues and other income of $488.8 million, and a net loss of $571.7 million. During 2015, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, which we consider to be the critical measures in evaluating our operating performance, met or exceeded the guidance issued to the public markets in February 2015, as revised in August 2015. Despite the rapidly deteriorating coal and oil and gas markets in 2015, we recorded Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 of $292.1 million, which was essentially flat compared to our Adjusted EBITDA in 2014, and Distributable Cash Flow of $197.0 million, which exceeded expectations and was down only 5% compared to 2014. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA.\" For a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow.\" Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provide information useful in assessing our segment financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, respectively.\nOur business is organized into four operating segments:\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other-consists primarily of coal royalty, coal related transportation and processing assets, aggregate and industrial minerals royalty assets and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across the United States.\nSoda Ash-consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.\nVantaCore-consists of our construction materials business acquired in October 2014 that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. VantaCore operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana.\nOil and Gas-consists of our non-operated working interests, royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties. Our primary interests in oil and natural gas producing properties are non-operated working interests located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. We also own fee mineral, royalty or overriding royalty interests in oil and gas properties in several other regions, including the Appalachian Basin, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\nCurrent Liquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $64.8 million of liquidity that consisted of $51.8 million in cash and $13.0 million in combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our debt by a net amount of $91.0 million. Opco's $300.0 million revolving credit facility matures in October 2017, and as of December 31, 2015, we had $290.0 million outstanding thereunder. We borrowed $75.0 million under Opco's revolving credit facility in September 2015 in order to repay Opco's term loan in full. In October 2015, the borrowing base under the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility was redetermined to $88.0 million, and we repaid $15.0 million under that credit facility, reducing our outstanding borrowings thereunder to $85.0 million. As of the date of this report, the combined borrowing capacity under our two revolving credit facilities is $13.0 million.\nIn February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27%, or 139 million tons, of our hard mineral reserves as of December 31, 2015 for $10.0 million in cash. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves, or 1,094 MBoe, as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt.\nWe have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on Opco's senior notes each year through 2018, and our operating results continue to be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. In April 2015, we announced a long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the partnership for future growth. As part of that plan, we reduced our cash distributions with respect to the first and second quarters of 2015 to $0.90 per common unit (giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse unit split effective on February 17, 2016), a 75% decrease from the distribution paid with respect to fourth quarter of 2014. In October 2015, the Board further reduced the distribution to $0.45 per common unit (giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse unit split effective on February 17, 2016) with respect to the third quarter of 2015, representing an additional 50% reduction in the distribution paid with respect to the second quarter of 2015. The cash savings resulting from the distribution reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We have also taken steps to reduce general and administrative and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts. However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our deleveraging objectives and have determined to sell certain assets to help meet these objectives. While we have closed two asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected.\nCurrent Results/Market Outlook\nCoal, Hard Minerals Royalty and Other Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Coal, Hard Minerals Royalty and Other business segment contributed revenues and other income of $246.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $204.6 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $212.2 million. Our revenues and other income from the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment represented 51% of our total revenues and other income in 2015, as compared to 64% of total revenues and other income in 2014, in part due to revenues reported for a full year of ownership of VantaCore. Although our total revenues and other income for 2015 increased over 2014, our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other revenues were down 4% compared to the same period. The majority of this decrease was due to lower coal prices in each of the Appalachian regions during the period and in the Illinois Basin as a result primarily of lower coal production during the period. This decrease in coal royalty revenues was partially offset by an increase in other coal related revenues, which increased 82% over the 2014 period, due to increased minimums recognized as revenue, increases in gains recognized on coal reserve swaps, condemnation payments and the receipt of lease assignment fees.\nBoth the thermal and metallurgical coal markets remain severely challenged, and we do not anticipate that either market will recover in the near term. We expect that coal producers will continue to cut production and idle additional mines in response to market conditions, but we do not know to what extent our properties may be affected. A number of coal producers have filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and additional producers may file for bankruptcy. Historically, our leases have generally been assumed and all pre-petition bankruptcy amounts have been cured in full in our lessees' bankruptcy processes, but we have no assurance this will continue in the future. In October 2015, Patriot Coal Corporation completed the sale of its assets in accordance with its bankruptcy plan. All of our leases were assumed and assigned in the sale process, and we received full pre-petition cure payments. Alpha Natural Resources (\"Alpha\"), which is our second largest lessee, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Alpha has continued operating and paying royalties to us following the bankruptcy filing. However, Alpha has reduced production and idled certain mines, and we expect that Alpha will continue to reduce production and/or idle mines during its bankruptcy process. Production cuts and mine idlings by Alpha have resulted in and would continue to result in decreased royalty payments to us to the extent such production cuts or idlings are on our properties. We estimate that Alpha owes us approximately $3.2 million in pre-petition royalties and minimum payments, and we expect to receive pre-petition amounts due to us with respect to any leases that are assumed in the bankruptcy process. Arch Coal, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016. While we do not yet know whether our leases will be assumed or rejected in Arch's bankruptcy process, our overall exposure to Arch is immaterial.\nWhile producers of Central Appalachian thermal coal have struggled for an extended period due to the high cost nature of their operations, production from our Illinois Basin properties also decreased by 15% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Part of the decrease in production from our Illinois Basin properties is attributable to the idling of Foresight Energy's (\"Foresight Energy\") Deer Run mine (which we also refer to as our Hillsboro property) as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine beginning in March 2015. In July 2015, we received a notice from Foresight Energy declaring a resulting force majeure event at the Deer Run mine. While we have filed a lawsuit disputing Foresight Energy's claim of force majeure, the effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to pay us quarterly minimum deficiency payments with respect to the Deer Run mine until mining resumes. Under the lease for the Deer Run mine, Foresight Energy is required to make minimum deficiency payments to us of $7.5 million per quarter, or $30.0 million per year. The amount payable to us as the minimum deficiency payment with respect to any quarter is reduced by the amount of coal royalties actually paid to us for tonnage sold at the mine with respect to that quarter. We received royalty payments on tonnage sold from coal stockpiles at the Deer Run mine during the second and third quarters of 2015, but royalty payments from tonnage sold with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly declined and we expect that the stockpiles will be depleted early in the first quarter of 2016. Foresight Energy's failure to make the deficiency payments with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 resulted in a negative cash impact to us of $16.2 million. Such amount will increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled. We do not know when, or if, mining activities at the Deer Run mine will recommence.\nThe metallurgical coal markets continued to deteriorate during 2015, and the metallurgical coal benchmark price for the first quarter of 2016 was set at a new multi-year low. We derived approximately 38% of our coal royalty revenues and 30% of the related production from metallurgical coal during 2015. The global metallurgical coal market continues to suffer from oversupply driven in part by reduced demand from China. Domestic coal producers are also burdened by the effects of the relatively strong U.S. dollar, which increases the production cost of domestic coal producers relative to foreign producers.\nSoda Ash Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Soda Ash business segment contributed revenues and other income of $49.9 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $46.8 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $43.0 million. Our trona mining and soda ash refinery investment performed in line with our expectations in 2015 with record soda ash production volumes. During 2015, the international market for soda ash weakened somewhat due to softer pricing, but Ciner Wyoming's international sales were consistent with expectations. Domestic sales volumes, which are typically sold at higher prices than soda ash sold internationally, have remained relatively stable. The cash we receive from Ciner Wyoming is in part determined by the quarterly distributions declared by Ciner Resources LP. In February 2016, Ciner Resources LP paid a quarterly distribution of $0.5575 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 1% over the distribution paid with respect to the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 5% over the distribution paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nVantaCore Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our VantaCore business segment contributed revenues and other income of $139.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $22.1 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $18.8 million.\nVantaCore's construction aggregates mining and production business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves and is also seasonal, with lower production and sales expected during the first quarter of each year due to winter weather. VantaCore's Laurel Aggregates operation in southwestern Pennsylvania serves producers and oilfield service companies operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and was impacted during 2015 by the slowing pace of exploration and development of natural gas in those areas due to low natural gas prices. Increased local construction activity partially offset these declines during 2015, but we expect that Laurel's business will continue to be impacted by decreased natural gas development activities. VantaCore's operations based in Clarksville, Tennessee and Baton Rouge, Louisiana depend on the pace of commercial and residential construction in those areas. The Clarksville operation performed above expectations during 2015, while the Baton Rouge operation volumes were lower than expected. In June 2015, VantaCore purchased a hard rock quarry operation located on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, Kentucky from one of NRP's aggregates lessees that had previously idled the operation. This operation continues to lease reserves from NRP and sells its produced limestone aggregates in both the local market and downstream to river-based markets.\nOil and Gas Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Oil and Gas business segment contributed revenues and other income of $53.6 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $31.0 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $24.6 million. Revenues in our Oil and Gas business segment decreased year-over year primarily due to a decline in oil prices, partially offset by increased production volumes.\nGlobal oil prices continued to decline in 2015 and remained significantly lower than 2014, and prices have continued to decline in the first quarter of 2016. Although domestic crude oil production has shown signs of decline, inventories remain above the five-year average indicating continued excessive supply. Production of crude is estimated to continue to decline as a result of reduced development drilling activities. Natural gas prices have also shown recent declines due to reduced demand and increased inventories. Our oil and gas revenues will continue to fluctuate with changes in prices for oil and natural gas and are expected to decrease over time due to natural production declines in producing wells and significantly decreased drilling activity. As of the date of this filing, we have not hedged any of our future oil or natural gas production.\nManagement's Forecast and Strategic Plan\nOpco's revolving credit facility matures in October 2017 and NRP's 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April 2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. Through February 2016, we completed asset sales for $47.5 million in gross proceeds. However, we believe the deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals. Traditionally, we have accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have the ability to access either the debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of companies\nwith coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.\nWhile NRP has a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable operations with positive operating cash flows, its operating results and credit metrics continue to be impacted by demand challenges for coal and excess worldwide supply of oil and gas. In particular, as described in \"Note 10. Debt and Debt-Affiliate\" in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the agreements governing the outstanding debt of NRP Oil and Gas and Opco contain customary financial covenants, including maintenance covenants, and other restrictive covenants. In addition, NRP has issued $425 million of 9.125% Senior Notes, that are governed by an indenture (\"the Indenture\") containing customary incurrence-based financial covenants and other covenants, but not maintenance covenants. The following discussion presents management's outlook and strategic plan to address its debt covenant compliance.\nOpco and NRP\nAs of December 31, 2015, Opco had $290.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility due October 2017 (the \"Opco Credit Facility\") and $585.9 million outstanding under several series of Private Placement Notes (the \"Opco Private Placement Notes\") (collectively referred to as the \"Opco Debt agreements\"). The maximum leverage ratio under the Opco Debt agreements is required to be below 4.0x through March 31, 2016. Commencing with respect to the period ended June 30, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio reduces to 3.75x and reduces again to 3.5x commencing with respect to the period ended June 30, 2017. In addition, the Opco Debt agreements contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco's ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Opco was in compliance with and we forecast that Opco will continue to remain in compliance through December 31, 2016 with the covenants contained in its debt agreements. In addition, we believe Opco has sufficient liquidity to make all regularly scheduled principal and interest payments through December 31, 2016. We are currently pursuing or considering a number of actions including (i) dispositions of assets, (ii) actively managing our debt capital structure through a number of potential alternatives, including exchange offers and non-traditional debt financing, (iii) minimizing our capital expenditures, (iv) obtaining waivers or amendments from our lenders, (v) effectively managing our working capital and (vi) improving our cash flows from operations. While we forecast that we will be in compliance with all of the covenants under the Opco Debt agreements through December 31, 2016, our forecast is sensitive to commodity pricing and counterparty risk. Accordingly, we intend to pursue one or more of the alternatives discussed above in order to mitigate the effects of further commodity price and market deterioration which could otherwise cause us to breach financial covenants under the Opco Debt agreements. Breaches of the Opco Debt agreement covenants that are not waived or cured, to the extent possible, would result in an event of default under the Opco Debt agreements, and if such debt is accelerated by the lenders thereunder, such acceleration would also result in a cross-default under the Indenture.\nNRP Oil and Gas\nNRP Oil and Gas had $85.0 million outstanding under its senior secured, reserve-based revolving credit facility (the \"RBL Facility\") as of December 31, 2015. The facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of NRP Oil and Gas's assets and is not guaranteed by NRP or any other subsidiary of NRP. Due to the significant and sustained decline in oil prices since the end of 2014, we forecast that NRP Oil and Gas may not be able to remain in compliance with the 3.5x leverage ratio as required in the RBL Facility during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect that, due to current oil and gas prices, the next borrowing base redetermination under the RBL Facility that is scheduled to occur in May 2016 may result in a reduction of the borrowing base by an amount that would exceed NRP Oil and Gas's ability to repay principal within the required time-frame following such redetermination. In addition, the RBL Facility requires the entity to provide annual financial statements that include a report from its independent registered public accounting firm with an opinion that does not contain \"a \"going concern\" or like qualification or exception.\" Any of these events would qualify as an event of default and would provide the RBL Facility lenders with the ability to accelerate the debt outstanding under the RBL Facility to the extent not waived or cured. While we are attempting to take appropriate mitigating actions, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to amending, refinancing, extending the maturity or curing potential defaults in the RBL Facility will be sufficient, and we may be required to sell some or all of the assets of NRP Oil and Gas, raise new equity capital at NRP Oil and Gas or pursue restructuring alternatives. As a result, we believe there is substantial doubt about the ability of NRP Oil and Gas to continue as a going concern through December 31, 2016. As we\nwere in compliance with all covenants contained in the RBL Facility throughout 2015 and at December 31, 2015, we have classified this debt as non-current in accordance with its terms.\nAn event of default under the RBL facility and subsequent acceleration of that debt by the lenders thereunder would not result in a cross-default under the Indenture. NRP Oil and Gas is designated as an \"Unrestricted Subsidiary\" for purposes of the Indenture, which prevents an event of default under the RBL Facility and subsequent acceleration of that debt from triggering an event of default under the Indenture. In addition, there are no cross-defaults under the Opco Debt agreements as a result of defaults under the RBL Facility. As a result, there would be no default or acceleration of indebtedness under the Indenture or under the Opco Debt agreements in the event NRP Oil and Gas is in default under its RBL Facility.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $2.5 million, or 1%, from $294.6 million in 2014 to $292.1 million in 2015. The decrease is mainly related to declines in our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and Oil and Gas business segments year-over-year, partially offset by higher income from our VantaCore business that was acquired in October 2014. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6.

Total coal royalty revenues decreased $40.2 million, or 22%, from $184.2 million in 2014 to $144.0 million in 2015. Coal prices continue to be depressed, which has negatively affected our coal related revenues. Further declines or a continued low price environment could have an additional adverse effect on our coal related revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, total coal production and total coal royalty revenues were down in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Gulf Coast, while\nwe saw a significant increase in the Northern Powder River Basin. All Appalachian regions saw a decrease in coal royalty revenues during the year with coal royalty revenues in Northern Appalachia down 69% despite a 2% increase in production from that area. We saw a decrease in the average coal revenue per ton throughout all of our regions, with the exception of the Gulf Coast whose average coal revenue per ton remained flat, for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther coal related revenues increased $35.0 million, or 82%, from $42.5 million in 2014 to $77.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily a result of two lease assignment fee payments received in 2015 totaling $21.0 million, an $8.8 million increase in minimums recognized as revenue, $3.7 million public roadway condemnation payments and a $3.6 million increase in reserve swap gains year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by decreased overriding royalty revenue in 2015.\nHard mineral royalty revenues decreased $4.0 million, or 33%, from $12.1 million in 2014 to $8.1 million in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in minimums recognized as revenues and aggregate royalty revenues.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment increased $8.5 million, or 21%, from $41.4 million in 2014 to $49.9 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to our allocated percentage of Ciner Wyoming's $15.0 million increase in income year-over-year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $46.8 million in cash distributions from Ciner Wyoming and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $46.6 million in cash distributions.\nVantaCore\nTonnage sold by the VantaCore segment increased 5.1 million tons from 2.3 million tons in 2014 to 7.4 million tons in 2015. Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment increased $96.9 million, or 231%, from $42.1 million in 2014 to $139.0 million in 2015. This increase is due to the fact that VantaCore was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOil and Gas\nRevenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment decreased $6.0 million, or 10%, from $59.6 million in 2014 to $53.6 million in 2015. This decrease is due to lower commodity prices during the year, partially offset by increased production, primarily as a result of the acquisition of non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin in November 2014.

This increase is primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of VantaCore operating expenses in 2015.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $1.7 million, or 5%, from $34.2 million in 2014 to $32.5 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily related to decreased overhead expenses allocated to the segment, specifically a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in unit price year-over-year.\nVantaCore\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our VantaCore segment increased $78.2 million from $38.7 million in 2014 to $116.9 million in 2015. This increase is due to the fact that 2014 results only include three months of VantaCore activity as compared to twelve months in 2015.\nOil and Gas\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our Oil and Gas segment increased $1.3 million, or 6%, from $21.3 million in 2014 to $22.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to a full year of operating expenses related to the fourth quarter 2014 Sanish Field acquisition, partially offset by decreased overhead as a result of the 2014 consulting expenses related to the acquisition. The average production cost per unit decreased $3.88 per unit, or 30%, from $13.08 per unit in 2014 to $9.20 per unit in 2015.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") Expense\nDD&A expense increased $20.9 million, or 26%, from $79.9 million in 2014 to $100.8 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to a full year of DD&A expense on our VantaCore and Sanish Field assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by decreased DD&A expense as a result of the reduction in our assets basis due to the 2015 asset impairments described below.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nDD&A expense for our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $8.1 million, or 15%, from $52.6 million in 2014 to $44.5 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in depletion expense on the assets that were impaired during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nVantaCore\nDD&A expense for our VantaCore segment increased $12.3 million from $3.3 million in 2014 to $15.6 million in 2015. This increase was due to the fact that 2014 results only include three months of activity as compared to a full year in 2015.\nOil and Gas\nDD&A expense for our Oil and Gas segment increased $16.9 million, or 70%, from $23.9 million in 2014 to $40.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased production as a result of a full year of expense on the assets acquired in the fourth quarter 2014 Sanish Field acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the reduction in asset basis on the assets impaired in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative (including affiliates) (\"G&A\") Expense\nCorporate and financing G&A expense includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs increased $1.8 million, or 17%, from $10.5 million in 2014 to $12.3 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries, bonus and benefits, consulting, rent and legal fees. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in unit price year-over-year.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment expense increased $655.4 million from $26.2 million in 2014 to $681.6 million in 2015.

This increase was primarily due to the significant impairment expense taken in the third quarter 2015. Coal property impairments primarily resulted from idled operations in Appalachia combined with the continued deterioration in the coal markets and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry. Hard mineral royalty property impairments primarily resulted from greenfield development projects that have not performed as projected, leading to recent lease concessions on minimums and royalties combined with the continued regional market decline for certain properties. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized an additional $8.2 million impairment expense on our coal properties as a result of continued market declines and $4.7 million impairment expense related to coal processing and transportation assets as well as obsolete equipment at our Logan office. During the second quarter of 2015 we recorded a $2.3 million impairment expense related to a coal preparation plant. With continued weakness in the commodity markets, we will continue to closely monitor our assets for impairment. It is reasonably possible that our estimate of future net cash flows could change in the near term. If conditions in coal markets continue to deteriorate, it is likely that additional non-cash write-downs of properties would occur in the future.\nVantaCore\nAsset impairment expense related to our VantaCore segment increased from $0.0 million in 2014 to $6.2 million in 2015. The 2015 impairment expense was primarily related to the $5.5 million write off of goodwill as well as a $0.7 million impairment related to obsolete plant and equipment.\nOil and Gas\nAsset impairment expense related to our Oil and Gas segment increased from $0.0 million in 2014 to $367.6 million in 2015. The 2015 impairment expense in our Oil and Gas segment primarily resulted from declines in future expected realized commodity prices and reduced expected drilling activity on our acreage.\nGiven the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term. If oil and natural gas prices decline from the prices used in our impairment analysis, it is likely that additional non-cash write-downs of oil and gas properties will occur in the future. If future capital expenditures are greater than expected or if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserve volumes, our estimate of future net cash flows from oil and natural gas reserves would decrease and non-cash write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties may occur in the future. In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of our oil and gas properties to changes in oil and gas prices, management modeled a 10% change in the forward price curve across the full term of expected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties. This 10% change in oil and gas prices resulted in zero additional non-cash write-downs and an immaterial decline in our oil and natural gas reserve volumes.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $13.6 million, or 17%, from $80.2 million in 2014 to $93.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of additional debt incurred to complete acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $37.6 million, or 11%, from $332.2 million in 2013 to $294.6 million in 2014. This decrease is mainly related to the special distribution of $44.8 million received in 2013 from Ciner Wyoming as well as lower coal related revenues offset by higher earnings from our VantaCore and Oil and Gas business segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6.

to $208.4 million in 2014. This decrease was due primarily to a $44.8 million special distribution received from Ciner Wyoming in 2013, declines in the coal business, and an additional $21.0 million of interest paid in 2014 that resulted in a $36.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operations relative to 2013 and also a $9.5 million difference in proceeds from the sale of assets.

production decreased 2.8 million tons, or 5%, from 53.3 million tons in 2013 50.5 million tons in 2014. Total coal royalty revenues decreased $28.5 million, or 13%, from $212.7 million in 2013 to $184.2 million in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, total coal production, total coal royalty revenues and average coal royalty revenue per ton were down in all Appalachia regions. Production in the Illinois Basin remained relatively flat year-over-year; however, total royalty revenues decreased $2.0 million due to a 4% decrease in average royalty revenue per ton. Total coal production, total coal royalty revenues and average royalty revenue per ton remained relatively flat in both the Northern Powder River Basin and the Gulf Coast.\nOther coal related revenues decreased $19.0 million, or 31%, from $61.5 million in 2013 to $42.5 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily a result of a $10.4 million condemnation payment received in 2013 in addition to a $5.8 million decrease in override revenues and a $2.5 million decrease in reserve swap gains year-over-year\nHard mineral royalty revenues decreased $1.4 million, or 10%, from $13.5 million in 2013 to $12.1 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to one of our lessees moving from property on which we receive royalty revenue to property on which we receive overriding royalty revenue and another lessee temporarily idling its operation in early 2014. This decrease was offset by an increase in override revenues of approximately $2.0 million in our overriding royalty revenues from frac sand properties, the remaining increase is due to override revenues increasing on our Washington aggregates property due to a lessee moving from our owned property to an area subject to an override.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment increased $7.2 million, or 21%, from $34.2 million in 2013 to $41.4 million in 2014. This increase was due to improved earnings at Ciner Wyoming in 2014 over 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $46.6 million in cash distributions and for the year ended December 31, 2014 we received $72.9 million in cash, which included a one-time special distribution of $44.8 million.\nVantaCore\nTonnage sold by the VanataCore segment was 2.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment was $42.1 million in 2014. We acquired VantaCore in October 2014.\nOil and Gas\nRevenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment increased $42.5 million from $17.1 million in 2013 to $59.6 million in 2014. This increase is due to a full year of revenues from our non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin that were acquired the second half of 2013. In addition, our 2014 results include revenues attributable to our Sanish Field properties acquired in November 2014.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) increased $52.2 million from $42.0 million in 2013 to $94.2 million in 2014. This increase was primarily the result of expenses related to VantaCore and our Sanish Field operations, which were both acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $15.5 million, or 24%, from $64.4 million in 2013 to $79.9 million in 2014. This increase was due to a full year depletion on the oil and gas assets acquired in the second half of 2013 as well as the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on the VantaCore and Sanish Field assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative (including affiliates)\nCorporate and financing G&A expenses include corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs decreased $4.2 million, or 28%, from $14.7 million in 2013 to $10.5 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in our unit price.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment expense increased $25.5 million from $0.7 million in 2013 to $26.2 million in 2014. This increase is due to the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment's impairment of $19.8 million related to its mineral rights, $5.6 million related to its intangible assets and $0.8 million related to its plant and equipment in 2014. The Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment recorded a $0.7 million impairment related to its mineral rights in 2013.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $15.8 million, or 25%, from $64.4 million in 2013 to $80.2 million in 2014. Interest expense increased due to additional debt incurred in 2014 and 2013 to fund acquisitions as well as a refinancing of our credit facility and payment on our term loan with 9.125% high yield notes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $64.8 million of liquidity that consisted of $51.8 million in cash and $13.0 million in combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our debt by a net amount of $91.0 million. Opco's $300.0 million revolving credit facility matures in October 2017, and as of December 31, 2015, we had $290.0 million outstanding thereunder. We borrowed $75.0 million under Opco's revolving credit facility in September 2015 in order to repay Opco's term loan in full. In October, 2015, the borrowing base under the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility was redetermined to $88.0 million, and we repaid $15.0 million under that facility, reducing our outstanding borrowings under that facility to $85.0 million. As of the date of this report, the combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities is $13.0 million.\nIn February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27%, or 139 million tons, of our hard mineral reserves as of December 31, 2015 for $10.0 million in cash. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves, or 1,094 MBoe, as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our current financial needs, we have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on Opco's senior notes each year through 2018, and our operating results continue to be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. In April 2015, we announced a long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the partnership for future growth. As part of that plan, we reduced our cash distributions during 2015 by over 87%. The cash savings resulting from the distribution reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We have also taken steps to reduce general and administrative and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts. However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our delevraging objectives and have determined to sell certain assets to help meet these objectives. While we have closed two asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected. For a more complete discussion of factors that will affect our liquidity, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nOpco's revolving credit facility matures in October 2017 and NRP's 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April 2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. Through February 2016, we completed asset sales for $47.5 million in gross proceeds. However, we believe the deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals. Traditionally, we have accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have the ability to access either the debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of companies with coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.\nGenerally, we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations. Our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $15.5 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to $80.8 million in principal payments\non Opco's senior notes due over the next year. Excluding these principal payments, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $65.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures, other than for acquisitions, have historically been minimal. However, as a result of our Sanish Field oil and gas and VantaCore aggregates acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014, our operating capital expenditures have been higher in 2015. In response to the significant decline in oil price, we expect our oil and gas capital expenditures to decline significantly in 2016 as compared to 2015. A portion of the capital expenditures associated with both our oil and gas working interest business and VantaCore are maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the long-term production capacity of those businesses. We deduct maintenance capital expenditures when calculating distributable cash flow. Total capital expenditures for NRP Oil and Gas for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $30.5 million. We continue to monitor the development programs of the operators of these properties and manage the capital expenditures associated with those properties by only participating in wells that are expected to provide acceptable economic returns. VantaCore's capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.0 million.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $203.4 million, $210.8 million and $247.1 million, respectively. The majority of our cash provided by operations is generated from coal royalty revenues, our equity interest in Ciner Wyoming as well as VantaCore and oil and gas revenues.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $30.3 million, $520.5 million and $302.8 million, respectively. During 2015 our investing activities primarily consisted of well participation costs within our Oil and Gas segment and plant and equipment acquisitions within our VantaCore segment. These 2015 investing cash outflows were partially offset by various asset sales including an aggregate preparation plant, cell phone tower lease contracts and condemnation payments within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment as well as sales of mineral rights within our Oil and Gas segment. Our 2014 investing activities consisted of our Sanish Field and VantaCore acquisitions, the $5.0 million Illinois Basin coal acquisition completed in June 2014, as well as additional capital expenditures related to the participation in new wells in connection with our Williston Basin non-operated oil and gas working interest properties. Our 2013 investing activities consisted of the acquisitions of the interest in Ciner Wyoming and two acquisitions of non-operated working interests in oil and gas properties located in the Williston Basin.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $171.5 million and net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $267.3 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.2 million. During 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had proceeds from loans of $100.0 million, $637.4 million and $567.0 million, respectively. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, these proceeds were offset by repayment of debt of $191.0 million, $328.0 million and $386.2 million, respectively. Also during 2015, 2014 and 2013 we paid cash distributions to our unitholders of $71.8 million, $162.0 million and $246.5 million, respectively. During 2014, we had net proceeds from an issuance of common units of $122.8 million, together with a capital contribution from our general partner of $3.2 million. During 2013, we had net proceeds from an issuance of common units of $74.7 million, together with a capital contribution from our general partner of $1.5 million.\nCapital Resources and Obligations\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had the following indebtedness (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and debt-affiliate, net\n</td> <td>1,304,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,394,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and debt-affiliate, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,384,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,475,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe were and continue to be in compliance with the terms of the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements.

In addition, BRP LLC (\"BRP\") leases office space for approximately $0.1 million per year through 2017. These rental obligations are included in the table above. \nAnadarko Contingent Consideration Payment Claim\nThe purchase agreement for the acquisition of our interest in Ciner Wyoming, formerly OCI Wyoming, requires us to pay additional contingent consideration to Anadarko to the extent certain performance criteria described in the purchase agreement are met at Ciner Wyoming in any of the years 2013, 2014 or 2015. We paid $0.5 million and $3.8 million of consideration in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015, respectively, in satisfaction of our obligations under this agreement with respect to 2013 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate, and have recorded $7.2 million as the amount that will be payable in the first quarter of 2016 with respect to 2015. We have no obligation to pay contingent consideration with respect to any period after 2015.\nIn March 2014, Anadarko gave us written notice that it believed certain reorganization transactions conducted in 2013 within the OCI organization triggered an acceleration of our obligation to pay the additional contingent consideration in full and demanded immediate payment of such amount. We disagreed with Anadarko's position in a written response provided to Anadarko in April 2014. In April 2015, Anadarko sent a written request for additional information regarding the OCI reorganization and indicated that they are still considering this claim against us. We do not believe the reorganization transactions triggered an obligation to pay the additional contingent consideration. We responded in writing in May 2015, and we will continue to engage in discussions with Anadarko to resolve the issue if necessary. However, if Anadarko were to pursue and prevail on such a claim, we would be required to pay an amount to Anadarko in excess of the amounts already paid, together with the $7.2 million accrual described above, up to the maximum amount of the additional contingent consideration, minus a deductible. Under the purchase agreement, the maximum cumulative amount of additional contingent consideration is an amount equal to the net present value of $50.0 million. Any additional amount paid by us would be considered to be additional acquisition consideration and added to Equity and other unconsolidated investments and would reduce our liquidity.\nShelf Registration Statement\nIn September 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of common units.\nUnrestricted Subsidiary Information\nIn February 2016, NRP designated NRP Oil and Gas as an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture. In addition, BRP LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Coval Leasing Company, LLC, are also Unrestricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture. For more information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of NRP and its Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture separate from NRP's Unrestricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture, see \"Note 17. Supplementary Unrestricted Subsidiary Information\" under the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly, there are no off-balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities.\nInflation\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nFor additional information on environmental regulation that may have a material impact on our business, see \"-Executive Overview-Political, Legal and Regulatory Environment Affecting Our Coal Business\" and \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Environmental Matters.\"\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe information required by this Item is included under \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12. Related Party Transactions\" and \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the reporting period. See \"Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Partnership's significant accounting policies. The following critical accounting policies are affected by estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenues\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other Revenues. Coal and hard mineral royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of mineral sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of mineral they sell. Processing fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material processed through the facilities by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees of the processing facilities make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of material that is processed and sold from the facilities. The processing leases are structured in a manner so that the lessees are responsible for operating and maintenance expenses associated with the facilities. Other revenues\ninclude transportation and processing fees. Transportation fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material transported over the beltlines. Under the terms of the transportation contracts, we receive a fixed price per ton for all material transported on the beltlines.\nSoda Ash Revenues. We account for non-marketable investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, an investee. Significant influence generally exists if we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. We account for our investment in Ciner Wyoming using this method.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and the proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. The basis difference between the investment and the proportional share of the fair value of the underlying net assets of equity method investees is hypothetically allocated first to identified tangible assets and liabilities, then to finite-lived intangibles or indefinite-lived intangibles and the remaining balance is attributed to goodwill. The portion of the basis difference attributed to net tangible assets and finite-lived intangibles is amortized over its estimated useful life while indefinite-lived intangibles, if any, and goodwill are not amortized. The amortization of the basis difference is recorded as a reduction of earnings from the equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOur carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption \"Equity and other unconsolidated investments\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our adjusted share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as revenues and other income under the caption \u2018\u2018Equity and other unconsolidated investment income.\" These earnings are generated from natural resources, which are considered part of our core business activities consistent with its directly owned revenue generating activities. Investee earnings are adjusted to reflect the amortization of any difference between the cost basis of the equity investment and the proportionate share of the investee's book value, which has been allocated to the fair value of net identified tangible and finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over the estimated lives of those assets.\nVantaCore Revenues. Revenues from the sale of aggregates, gravel, sand and asphalt are recorded based upon the transfer of product at delivery to customers, which generally occurs at the quarries or asphalt plants. Revenues from long-term construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. That method is used since we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, which result in revisions to job costs and profits are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Contract costs include all direct job costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, insurance, equipment maintenance and depreciation. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nOil and Gas Revenues. Oil and gas related revenues consist of revenues from our non-operated working interests, royalties and overriding royalties. Revenues related to our non-operated working interests in oil and gas assets are recognized on the basis of our net revenue interests in hydrocarbons produced. We also have capital expenditure and operating expenditure obligations associated with the non-operated working interests. Our revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas, the decline in production from producing wells, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate our wells, including the cost of development and production. Oil and gas royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Also, included within oil and gas royalties are lease bonus payments, which are generally paid upon the execution of a lease.\nDeferred Revenue\nMost of our coal and aggregates lessees must make minimum annual or quarterly payments which are generally recoupable over certain time periods. These minimum payments are recorded as deferred revenue when received. The deferred revenue attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as revenue when the lessee recoups the minimum payment through production or in the period immediately following the expiration of the lessee's ability to recoup the payments.\nLessee Audits and Inspections\nWe periodically audit lessee information by examining certain records and internal reports of our lessees. Our regional managers also perform periodic mine inspections to verify that the information that has been reported to us is accurate. The audit\nand inspection processes are designed to identify material variances from lease terms as well as differences between the information reported to us and the actual results from each property. Audits and inspections, however, are in periods subsequent to when the revenue is reported and any adjustment identified by these processes might be in a reporting period different from when the revenue was initially recorded. Typically there are no material adjustments from this process.\nShare-Based Payment\nWe account for awards relating to our Long-Term Incentive Plan using the fair value method, which requires us to estimate the fair value of the grant, and charge or credit the estimated fair value to expense over the service or vesting period of the grant based on fluctuations in our common unit price. In addition, estimated forfeitures are included in the periodic computation of the fair value of the liability and the fair value is recalculated at each reporting date over the service or vesting period of the grant.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have developed procedures to periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for possible impairment. These procedures are performed throughout the year and are based on historic, current and future performance and are designed to be early warning tests. If an asset fails one of the early warning tests, additional evaluation is performed for that asset that considers both quantitative and qualitative information. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the future expected undiscounted cash flows from its use and disposition is less than the assets' carrying value. Impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value, which is usually determined based upon the present value of the projected future cash flow compared to the assets' carrying value. We believe our estimates of cash flows and discount rates are consistent with those of principal market participants. In addition to the evaluations discussed above, specific events such as a reduction in economically recoverable reserves or production ceasing on a property for an extended period may require a separate impairment evaluation be completed on a significant property. As a result of the continued weakness in the coal markets and the potential for further declines in oil and natural gas prices, we intend to closely monitor our coal and oil and gas assets, and the impairment evaluation process may be completed more frequently if deemed necessary. Future impairment analyses could result in downward adjustments to the carrying value of our assets. During 2015, we recorded impairment expense of $676.1 million on certain of our mineral rights within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and Oil and Gas segments as well as plant and equipment within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and VantaCore segments. For further discussion relating to our 2015 impairments see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 8. Minerals Rights\" and \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Plant and Equipment\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, management compares the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment loss. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, or upon the present value of expected cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nIn accordance with FASB accounting and disclosure guidance for goodwill, we test our recorded goodwill for impairment annually or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist, by determining if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Factors that could trigger an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in our overall business, industry, or economic trends. We recorded a $5.5 million impairment loss related to the VantaCore reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nFor purchase acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques.\nProved Oil and Gas Reserves\nThe Partnership utilizes Netherland Sewell, an independent reserve engineering firm, to estimate its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices are calculated using the unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing and then adjusted for transportation and other costs. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Netherland Sewell in their reserves estimation process.\nThe Partnership's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by Netherland Sewell and our internal staff of petroleum engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the applicable section of \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINACNIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis presents management's view of our business, financial condition and overall performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this filing. Our discussion and analysis consists of the following subjects:\n\u2022Executive Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Unrestricted Subsidiary Information\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Environmental Regulation\n\u2022Related Party Transactions\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Standards\nAs used in this Item 7, unless the context otherwise requires: \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us\" and the \"Partnership\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. and, where the context requires, our subsidiaries. References to \"NRP\" and \"Natural Resource Partners\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. only, and not to NRP (Operating) LLC or any of Natural Resource Partners L.P.'s subsidiaries. References to \"Opco\" refer to NRP (Operating) LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP, and its subsidiaries. References to NRP Oil and Gas refer to NRP Oil and Gas LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP. NRP Finance Corporation (\"NRP Finance\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP and a co-issuer with NRP on the 9.125% senior notes.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, crude oil and natural gas, construction aggregates, frac sand and other natural resources. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"NRP\". The information presented in Item 7. reflects the one-for-ten reverse unit split that was effective on February 17, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded revenues and other income of $488.8 million, and a net loss of $571.7 million. During 2015, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, which we consider to be the critical measures in evaluating our operating performance, met or exceeded the guidance issued to the public markets in February 2015, as revised in August 2015. Despite the rapidly deteriorating coal and oil and gas markets in 2015, we recorded Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 of $292.1 million, which was essentially flat compared to our Adjusted EBITDA in 2014, and Distributable Cash Flow of $197.0 million, which exceeded expectations and was down only 5% compared to 2014. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA.\" For a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow.\" Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provide information useful in assessing our segment financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, respectively.\nOur business is organized into four operating segments:\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other-consists primarily of coal royalty, coal related transportation and processing assets, aggregate and industrial minerals royalty assets and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across the United States.\nSoda Ash-consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.\nVantaCore-consists of our construction materials business acquired in October 2014 that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. VantaCore operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana.\nOil and Gas-consists of our non-operated working interests, royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties. Our primary interests in oil and natural gas producing properties are non-operated working interests located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. We also own fee mineral, royalty or overriding royalty interests in oil and gas properties in several other regions, including the Appalachian Basin, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\nCurrent Liquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $64.8 million of liquidity that consisted of $51.8 million in cash and $13.0 million in combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our debt by a net amount of $91.0 million. Opco's $300.0 million revolving credit facility matures in October 2017, and as of December 31, 2015, we had $290.0 million outstanding thereunder. We borrowed $75.0 million under Opco's revolving credit facility in September 2015 in order to repay Opco's term loan in full. In October 2015, the borrowing base under the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility was redetermined to $88.0 million, and we repaid $15.0 million under that credit facility, reducing our outstanding borrowings thereunder to $85.0 million. As of the date of this report, the combined borrowing capacity under our two revolving credit facilities is $13.0 million.\nIn February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27%, or 139 million tons, of our hard mineral reserves as of December 31, 2015 for $10.0 million in cash. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves, or 1,094 MBoe, as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt.\nWe have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on Opco's senior notes each year through 2018, and our operating results continue to be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. In April 2015, we announced a long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the partnership for future growth. As part of that plan, we reduced our cash distributions with respect to the first and second quarters of 2015 to $0.90 per common unit (giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse unit split effective on February 17, 2016), a 75% decrease from the distribution paid with respect to fourth quarter of 2014. In October 2015, the Board further reduced the distribution to $0.45 per common unit (giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse unit split effective on February 17, 2016) with respect to the third quarter of 2015, representing an additional 50% reduction in the distribution paid with respect to the second quarter of 2015. The cash savings resulting from the distribution reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We have also taken steps to reduce general and administrative and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts. However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our deleveraging objectives and have determined to sell certain assets to help meet these objectives. While we have closed two asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected.\nCurrent Results/Market Outlook\nCoal, Hard Minerals Royalty and Other Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Coal, Hard Minerals Royalty and Other business segment contributed revenues and other income of $246.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $204.6 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $212.2 million. Our revenues and other income from the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment represented 51% of our total revenues and other income in 2015, as compared to 64% of total revenues and other income in 2014, in part due to revenues reported for a full year of ownership of VantaCore. Although our total revenues and other income for 2015 increased over 2014, our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other revenues were down 4% compared to the same period. The majority of this decrease was due to lower coal prices in each of the Appalachian regions during the period and in the Illinois Basin as a result primarily of lower coal production during the period. This decrease in coal royalty revenues was partially offset by an increase in other coal related revenues, which increased 82% over the 2014 period, due to increased minimums recognized as revenue, increases in gains recognized on coal reserve swaps, condemnation payments and the receipt of lease assignment fees.\nBoth the thermal and metallurgical coal markets remain severely challenged, and we do not anticipate that either market will recover in the near term. We expect that coal producers will continue to cut production and idle additional mines in response to market conditions, but we do not know to what extent our properties may be affected. A number of coal producers have filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and additional producers may file for bankruptcy. Historically, our leases have generally been assumed and all pre-petition bankruptcy amounts have been cured in full in our lessees' bankruptcy processes, but we have no assurance this will continue in the future. In October 2015, Patriot Coal Corporation completed the sale of its assets in accordance with its bankruptcy plan. All of our leases were assumed and assigned in the sale process, and we received full pre-petition cure payments. Alpha Natural Resources (\"Alpha\"), which is our second largest lessee, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Alpha has continued operating and paying royalties to us following the bankruptcy filing. However, Alpha has reduced production and idled certain mines, and we expect that Alpha will continue to reduce production and/or idle mines during its bankruptcy process. Production cuts and mine idlings by Alpha have resulted in and would continue to result in decreased royalty payments to us to the extent such production cuts or idlings are on our properties. We estimate that Alpha owes us approximately $3.2 million in pre-petition royalties and minimum payments, and we expect to receive pre-petition amounts due to us with respect to any leases that are assumed in the bankruptcy process. Arch Coal, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016. While we do not yet know whether our leases will be assumed or rejected in Arch's bankruptcy process, our overall exposure to Arch is immaterial.\nWhile producers of Central Appalachian thermal coal have struggled for an extended period due to the high cost nature of their operations, production from our Illinois Basin properties also decreased by 15% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Part of the decrease in production from our Illinois Basin properties is attributable to the idling of Foresight Energy's (\"Foresight Energy\") Deer Run mine (which we also refer to as our Hillsboro property) as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine beginning in March 2015. In July 2015, we received a notice from Foresight Energy declaring a resulting force majeure event at the Deer Run mine. While we have filed a lawsuit disputing Foresight Energy's claim of force majeure, the effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to pay us quarterly minimum deficiency payments with respect to the Deer Run mine until mining resumes. Under the lease for the Deer Run mine, Foresight Energy is required to make minimum deficiency payments to us of $7.5 million per quarter, or $30.0 million per year. The amount payable to us as the minimum deficiency payment with respect to any quarter is reduced by the amount of coal royalties actually paid to us for tonnage sold at the mine with respect to that quarter. We received royalty payments on tonnage sold from coal stockpiles at the Deer Run mine during the second and third quarters of 2015, but royalty payments from tonnage sold with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly declined and we expect that the stockpiles will be depleted early in the first quarter of 2016. Foresight Energy's failure to make the deficiency payments with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 resulted in a negative cash impact to us of $16.2 million. Such amount will increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled. We do not know when, or if, mining activities at the Deer Run mine will recommence.\nThe metallurgical coal markets continued to deteriorate during 2015, and the metallurgical coal benchmark price for the first quarter of 2016 was set at a new multi-year low. We derived approximately 38% of our coal royalty revenues and 30% of the related production from metallurgical coal during 2015. The global metallurgical coal market continues to suffer from oversupply driven in part by reduced demand from China. Domestic coal producers are also burdened by the effects of the relatively strong U.S. dollar, which increases the production cost of domestic coal producers relative to foreign producers.\nSoda Ash Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Soda Ash business segment contributed revenues and other income of $49.9 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $46.8 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $43.0 million. Our trona mining and soda ash refinery investment performed in line with our expectations in 2015 with record soda ash production volumes. During 2015, the international market for soda ash weakened somewhat due to softer pricing, but Ciner Wyoming's international sales were consistent with expectations. Domestic sales volumes, which are typically sold at higher prices than soda ash sold internationally, have remained relatively stable. The cash we receive from Ciner Wyoming is in part determined by the quarterly distributions declared by Ciner Resources LP. In February 2016, Ciner Resources LP paid a quarterly distribution of $0.5575 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 1% over the distribution paid with respect to the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 5% over the distribution paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nVantaCore Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our VantaCore business segment contributed revenues and other income of $139.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $22.1 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $18.8 million.\nVantaCore's construction aggregates mining and production business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves and is also seasonal, with lower production and sales expected during the first quarter of each year due to winter weather. VantaCore's Laurel Aggregates operation in southwestern Pennsylvania serves producers and oilfield service companies operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and was impacted during 2015 by the slowing pace of exploration and development of natural gas in those areas due to low natural gas prices. Increased local construction activity partially offset these declines during 2015, but we expect that Laurel's business will continue to be impacted by decreased natural gas development activities. VantaCore's operations based in Clarksville, Tennessee and Baton Rouge, Louisiana depend on the pace of commercial and residential construction in those areas. The Clarksville operation performed above expectations during 2015, while the Baton Rouge operation volumes were lower than expected. In June 2015, VantaCore purchased a hard rock quarry operation located on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, Kentucky from one of NRP's aggregates lessees that had previously idled the operation. This operation continues to lease reserves from NRP and sells its produced limestone aggregates in both the local market and downstream to river-based markets.\nOil and Gas Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our Oil and Gas business segment contributed revenues and other income of $53.6 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $31.0 million, and Distributable Cash Flow of $24.6 million. Revenues in our Oil and Gas business segment decreased year-over year primarily due to a decline in oil prices, partially offset by increased production volumes.\nGlobal oil prices continued to decline in 2015 and remained significantly lower than 2014, and prices have continued to decline in the first quarter of 2016. Although domestic crude oil production has shown signs of decline, inventories remain above the five-year average indicating continued excessive supply. Production of crude is estimated to continue to decline as a result of reduced development drilling activities. Natural gas prices have also shown recent declines due to reduced demand and increased inventories. Our oil and gas revenues will continue to fluctuate with changes in prices for oil and natural gas and are expected to decrease over time due to natural production declines in producing wells and significantly decreased drilling activity. As of the date of this filing, we have not hedged any of our future oil or natural gas production.\nManagement's Forecast and Strategic Plan\nOpco's revolving credit facility matures in October 2017 and NRP's 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April 2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. Through February 2016, we completed asset sales for $47.5 million in gross proceeds. However, we believe the deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals. Traditionally, we have accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have the ability to access either the debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of companies\nwith coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.\nWhile NRP has a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable operations with positive operating cash flows, its operating results and credit metrics continue to be impacted by demand challenges for coal and excess worldwide supply of oil and gas. In particular, as described in \"Note 10. Debt and Debt-Affiliate\" in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the agreements governing the outstanding debt of NRP Oil and Gas and Opco contain customary financial covenants, including maintenance covenants, and other restrictive covenants. In addition, NRP has issued $425 million of 9.125% Senior Notes, that are governed by an indenture (\"the Indenture\") containing customary incurrence-based financial covenants and other covenants, but not maintenance covenants. The following discussion presents management's outlook and strategic plan to address its debt covenant compliance.\nOpco and NRP\nAs of December 31, 2015, Opco had $290.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility due October 2017 (the \"Opco Credit Facility\") and $585.9 million outstanding under several series of Private Placement Notes (the \"Opco Private Placement Notes\") (collectively referred to as the \"Opco Debt agreements\"). The maximum leverage ratio under the Opco Debt agreements is required to be below 4.0x through March 31, 2016. Commencing with respect to the period ended June 30, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio reduces to 3.75x and reduces again to 3.5x commencing with respect to the period ended June 30, 2017. In addition, the Opco Debt agreements contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco's ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Opco was in compliance with and we forecast that Opco will continue to remain in compliance through December 31, 2016 with the covenants contained in its debt agreements. In addition, we believe Opco has sufficient liquidity to make all regularly scheduled principal and interest payments through December 31, 2016. We are currently pursuing or considering a number of actions including (i) dispositions of assets, (ii) actively managing our debt capital structure through a number of potential alternatives, including exchange offers and non-traditional debt financing, (iii) minimizing our capital expenditures, (iv) obtaining waivers or amendments from our lenders, (v) effectively managing our working capital and (vi) improving our cash flows from operations. While we forecast that we will be in compliance with all of the covenants under the Opco Debt agreements through December 31, 2016, our forecast is sensitive to commodity pricing and counterparty risk. Accordingly, we intend to pursue one or more of the alternatives discussed above in order to mitigate the effects of further commodity price and market deterioration which could otherwise cause us to breach financial covenants under the Opco Debt agreements. Breaches of the Opco Debt agreement covenants that are not waived or cured, to the extent possible, would result in an event of default under the Opco Debt agreements, and if such debt is accelerated by the lenders thereunder, such acceleration would also result in a cross-default under the Indenture.\nNRP Oil and Gas\nNRP Oil and Gas had $85.0 million outstanding under its senior secured, reserve-based revolving credit facility (the \"RBL Facility\") as of December 31, 2015. The facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of NRP Oil and Gas's assets and is not guaranteed by NRP or any other subsidiary of NRP. Due to the significant and sustained decline in oil prices since the end of 2014, we forecast that NRP Oil and Gas may not be able to remain in compliance with the 3.5x leverage ratio as required in the RBL Facility during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect that, due to current oil and gas prices, the next borrowing base redetermination under the RBL Facility that is scheduled to occur in May 2016 may result in a reduction of the borrowing base by an amount that would exceed NRP Oil and Gas's ability to repay principal within the required time-frame following such redetermination. In addition, the RBL Facility requires the entity to provide annual financial statements that include a report from its independent registered public accounting firm with an opinion that does not contain \"a \"going concern\" or like qualification or exception.\" Any of these events would qualify as an event of default and would provide the RBL Facility lenders with the ability to accelerate the debt outstanding under the RBL Facility to the extent not waived or cured. While we are attempting to take appropriate mitigating actions, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to amending, refinancing, extending the maturity or curing potential defaults in the RBL Facility will be sufficient, and we may be required to sell some or all of the assets of NRP Oil and Gas, raise new equity capital at NRP Oil and Gas or pursue restructuring alternatives. As a result, we believe there is substantial doubt about the ability of NRP Oil and Gas to continue as a going concern through December 31, 2016. As we\nwere in compliance with all covenants contained in the RBL Facility throughout 2015 and at December 31, 2015, we have classified this debt as non-current in accordance with its terms.\nAn event of default under the RBL facility and subsequent acceleration of that debt by the lenders thereunder would not result in a cross-default under the Indenture. NRP Oil and Gas is designated as an \"Unrestricted Subsidiary\" for purposes of the Indenture, which prevents an event of default under the RBL Facility and subsequent acceleration of that debt from triggering an event of default under the Indenture. In addition, there are no cross-defaults under the Opco Debt agreements as a result of defaults under the RBL Facility. As a result, there would be no default or acceleration of indebtedness under the Indenture or under the Opco Debt agreements in the event NRP Oil and Gas is in default under its RBL Facility.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $2.5 million, or 1%, from $294.6 million in 2014 to $292.1 million in 2015. The decrease is mainly related to declines in our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and Oil and Gas business segments year-over-year, partially offset by higher income from our VantaCore business that was acquired in October 2014. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\" for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and see below for our Adjusted EBITDA by business segment and a reconciliation to net income (loss) (in thousands):\n\nDistributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nDistributable Cash Flow for 2015 decreased $11.4 million, or 5%, from $208.4 million in 2014 to $197.0 million in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to a reduction in cash provided by our coal operations, partially offset by our VantaCore business that was acquired in October 2014. Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow\" for an explanation of Distributable Cash Flow and see below for Distributable Cash Flow by business segment a reconciliation to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (in thousands):\n\nRevenues and Other Income\nThe following table shows our diversified sources of revenues and other income by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands except for percentages):\n\nRevenues and other income increased $89.0 million, or 22%, from $399.8 million in 2014 to $488.8 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of VantaCore revenues and an increase in Soda Ash revenues during the year. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of revenues in both our Oil and Gas and Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other business segments.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nRevenues and other income related to our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $10.4 million, or 4%, from $256.7 million in 2014 to $246.4 million in 2015. The table below presents coal royalty production and revenues derived from our major coal producing regions, hard mineral royalty income and the significant categories of other revenues:\n\nTotal coal production decreased 3.4 million tons, or 7%, from 50.4 million tons in 2014 to 47.0 million tons in 2015. Total coal royalty revenues decreased $40.2 million, or 22%, from $184.2 million in 2014 to $144.0 million in 2015. Coal prices continue to be depressed, which has negatively affected our coal related revenues. Further declines or a continued low price environment could have an additional adverse effect on our coal related revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, total coal production and total coal royalty revenues were down in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Gulf Coast, while\nwe saw a significant increase in the Northern Powder River Basin. All Appalachian regions saw a decrease in coal royalty revenues during the year with coal royalty revenues in Northern Appalachia down 69% despite a 2% increase in production from that area. We saw a decrease in the average coal revenue per ton throughout all of our regions, with the exception of the Gulf Coast whose average coal revenue per ton remained flat, for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther coal related revenues increased $35.0 million, or 82%, from $42.5 million in 2014 to $77.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily a result of two lease assignment fee payments received in 2015 totaling $21.0 million, an $8.8 million increase in minimums recognized as revenue, $3.7 million public roadway condemnation payments and a $3.6 million increase in reserve swap gains year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by decreased overriding royalty revenue in 2015.\nHard mineral royalty revenues decreased $4.0 million, or 33%, from $12.1 million in 2014 to $8.1 million in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in minimums recognized as revenues and aggregate royalty revenues.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment increased $8.5 million, or 21%, from $41.4 million in 2014 to $49.9 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to our allocated percentage of Ciner Wyoming's $15.0 million increase in income year-over-year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $46.8 million in cash distributions from Ciner Wyoming and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $46.6 million in cash distributions.\nVantaCore\nTonnage sold by the VantaCore segment increased 5.1 million tons from 2.3 million tons in 2014 to 7.4 million tons in 2015. Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment increased $96.9 million, or 231%, from $42.1 million in 2014 to $139.0 million in 2015. This increase is due to the fact that VantaCore was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOil and Gas\nRevenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment decreased $6.0 million, or 10%, from $59.6 million in 2014 to $53.6 million in 2015. This decrease is due to lower commodity prices during the year, partially offset by increased production, primarily as a result of the acquisition of non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin in November 2014. The table below presents oil and gas production and revenues derived from our major oil and gas producing regions and the significant categories of oil and gas revenues:\n\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) increased $77.8 million, or 83%, from $94.2 million in 2014 to $172.0 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of VantaCore operating expenses in 2015.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $1.7 million, or 5%, from $34.2 million in 2014 to $32.5 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily related to decreased overhead expenses allocated to the segment, specifically a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in unit price year-over-year.\nVantaCore\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our VantaCore segment increased $78.2 million from $38.7 million in 2014 to $116.9 million in 2015. This increase is due to the fact that 2014 results only include three months of VantaCore activity as compared to twelve months in 2015.\nOil and Gas\nOperating and maintenance expenses in our Oil and Gas segment increased $1.3 million, or 6%, from $21.3 million in 2014 to $22.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to a full year of operating expenses related to the fourth quarter 2014 Sanish Field acquisition, partially offset by decreased overhead as a result of the 2014 consulting expenses related to the acquisition. The average production cost per unit decreased $3.88 per unit, or 30%, from $13.08 per unit in 2014 to $9.20 per unit in 2015.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") Expense\nDD&A expense increased $20.9 million, or 26%, from $79.9 million in 2014 to $100.8 million in 2015. This increase is primarily related to a full year of DD&A expense on our VantaCore and Sanish Field assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by decreased DD&A expense as a result of the reduction in our assets basis due to the 2015 asset impairments described below.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nDD&A expense for our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $8.1 million, or 15%, from $52.6 million in 2014 to $44.5 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in depletion expense on the assets that were impaired during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nVantaCore\nDD&A expense for our VantaCore segment increased $12.3 million from $3.3 million in 2014 to $15.6 million in 2015. This increase was due to the fact that 2014 results only include three months of activity as compared to a full year in 2015.\nOil and Gas\nDD&A expense for our Oil and Gas segment increased $16.9 million, or 70%, from $23.9 million in 2014 to $40.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased production as a result of a full year of expense on the assets acquired in the fourth quarter 2014 Sanish Field acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the reduction in asset basis on the assets impaired in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative (including affiliates) (\"G&A\") Expense\nCorporate and financing G&A expense includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs increased $1.8 million, or 17%, from $10.5 million in 2014 to $12.3 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries, bonus and benefits, consulting, rent and legal fees. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in unit price year-over-year.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment expense increased $655.4 million from $26.2 million in 2014 to $681.6 million in 2015. We recorded the following asset impairments during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nAsset impairment expense related to our Coal, Hard Mineral and Other segment increased $281.6 million from $26.2 million in 2014 to $307.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the significant impairment expense taken in the third quarter 2015. Coal property impairments primarily resulted from idled operations in Appalachia combined with the continued deterioration in the coal markets and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry. Hard mineral royalty property impairments primarily resulted from greenfield development projects that have not performed as projected, leading to recent lease concessions on minimums and royalties combined with the continued regional market decline for certain properties. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized an additional $8.2 million impairment expense on our coal properties as a result of continued market declines and $4.7 million impairment expense related to coal processing and transportation assets as well as obsolete equipment at our Logan office. During the second quarter of 2015 we recorded a $2.3 million impairment expense related to a coal preparation plant. With continued weakness in the commodity markets, we will continue to closely monitor our assets for impairment. It is reasonably possible that our estimate of future net cash flows could change in the near term. If conditions in coal markets continue to deteriorate, it is likely that additional non-cash write-downs of properties would occur in the future.\nVantaCore\nAsset impairment expense related to our VantaCore segment increased from $0.0 million in 2014 to $6.2 million in 2015. The 2015 impairment expense was primarily related to the $5.5 million write off of goodwill as well as a $0.7 million impairment related to obsolete plant and equipment.\nOil and Gas\nAsset impairment expense related to our Oil and Gas segment increased from $0.0 million in 2014 to $367.6 million in 2015. The 2015 impairment expense in our Oil and Gas segment primarily resulted from declines in future expected realized commodity prices and reduced expected drilling activity on our acreage.\nGiven the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term. If oil and natural gas prices decline from the prices used in our impairment analysis, it is likely that additional non-cash write-downs of oil and gas properties will occur in the future. If future capital expenditures are greater than expected or if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserve volumes, our estimate of future net cash flows from oil and natural gas reserves would decrease and non-cash write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties may occur in the future. In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of our oil and gas properties to changes in oil and gas prices, management modeled a 10% change in the forward price curve across the full term of expected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties. This 10% change in oil and gas prices resulted in zero additional non-cash write-downs and an immaterial decline in our oil and natural gas reserve volumes.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $13.6 million, or 17%, from $80.2 million in 2014 to $93.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of additional debt incurred to complete acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $37.6 million, or 11%, from $332.2 million in 2013 to $294.6 million in 2014. This decrease is mainly related to the special distribution of $44.8 million received in 2013 from Ciner Wyoming as well as lower coal related revenues offset by higher earnings from our VantaCore and Oil and Gas business segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\" for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and see below for Adjusted EBITDA by business segment and a reconciliation of to net income (loss) (in thousands):\n\nDistributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nDistributable Cash Flow for 2014 decreased by $98.5 million, or 32%, from $306.9 million in 2013 to $208.4 million in 2014. This decrease was due primarily to a $44.8 million special distribution received from Ciner Wyoming in 2013, declines in the coal business, and an additional $21.0 million of interest paid in 2014 that resulted in a $36.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operations relative to 2013 and also a $9.5 million difference in proceeds from the sale of assets. Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow\" for an explanation of Distributable Cash Flow and see below for Distributable Cash Flow by business segment and a reconciliation to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (in thousands):\n\nRevenues and Other Income\nThe following table shows our diversified sources of revenues and other income by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands except for percentages):\n\nRevenues and other income increased $41.7 million, or 12%, from $358.1 million in 2013 to $399.8 million in 2014. This increase was mainly due to the fourth quarter 2014 acquisition of VantaCore and Sanish Field, partially offset by a $50.2 million reduction in Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment revenues.\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other\nRevenues and other income related to our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment decreased $50.2 million, or 16%, from $306.9 million in 2013 to $256.7 million in 2014. The table below presents coal royalty production and revenues derived from our major coal producing regions, hard mineral royalty income and the significant categories of other revenues:\n\nTotal coal production decreased 2.8 million tons, or 5%, from 53.3 million tons in 2013 50.5 million tons in 2014. Total coal royalty revenues decreased $28.5 million, or 13%, from $212.7 million in 2013 to $184.2 million in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, total coal production, total coal royalty revenues and average coal royalty revenue per ton were down in all Appalachia regions. Production in the Illinois Basin remained relatively flat year-over-year; however, total royalty revenues decreased $2.0 million due to a 4% decrease in average royalty revenue per ton. Total coal production, total coal royalty revenues and average royalty revenue per ton remained relatively flat in both the Northern Powder River Basin and the Gulf Coast.\nOther coal related revenues decreased $19.0 million, or 31%, from $61.5 million in 2013 to $42.5 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily a result of a $10.4 million condemnation payment received in 2013 in addition to a $5.8 million decrease in override revenues and a $2.5 million decrease in reserve swap gains year-over-year\nHard mineral royalty revenues decreased $1.4 million, or 10%, from $13.5 million in 2013 to $12.1 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to one of our lessees moving from property on which we receive royalty revenue to property on which we receive overriding royalty revenue and another lessee temporarily idling its operation in early 2014. This decrease was offset by an increase in override revenues of approximately $2.0 million in our overriding royalty revenues from frac sand properties, the remaining increase is due to override revenues increasing on our Washington aggregates property due to a lessee moving from our owned property to an area subject to an override.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment increased $7.2 million, or 21%, from $34.2 million in 2013 to $41.4 million in 2014. This increase was due to improved earnings at Ciner Wyoming in 2014 over 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $46.6 million in cash distributions and for the year ended December 31, 2014 we received $72.9 million in cash, which included a one-time special distribution of $44.8 million.\nVantaCore\nTonnage sold by the VanataCore segment was 2.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment was $42.1 million in 2014. We acquired VantaCore in October 2014.\nOil and Gas\nRevenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment increased $42.5 million from $17.1 million in 2013 to $59.6 million in 2014. This increase is due to a full year of revenues from our non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin that were acquired the second half of 2013. In addition, our 2014 results include revenues attributable to our Sanish Field properties acquired in November 2014.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) increased $52.2 million from $42.0 million in 2013 to $94.2 million in 2014. This increase was primarily the result of expenses related to VantaCore and our Sanish Field operations, which were both acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $15.5 million, or 24%, from $64.4 million in 2013 to $79.9 million in 2014. This increase was due to a full year depletion on the oil and gas assets acquired in the second half of 2013 as well as the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on the VantaCore and Sanish Field assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative (including affiliates)\nCorporate and financing G&A expenses include corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs decreased $4.2 million, or 28%, from $14.7 million in 2013 to $10.5 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in LTIP expense as a result of the decline in our unit price.\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairment expense increased $25.5 million from $0.7 million in 2013 to $26.2 million in 2014. This increase is due to the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment's impairment of $19.8 million related to its mineral rights, $5.6 million related to its intangible assets and $0.8 million related to its plant and equipment in 2014. The Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment recorded a $0.7 million impairment related to its mineral rights in 2013.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $15.8 million, or 25%, from $64.4 million in 2013 to $80.2 million in 2014. Interest expense increased due to additional debt incurred in 2014 and 2013 to fund acquisitions as well as a refinancing of our credit facility and payment on our term loan with 9.125% high yield notes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $64.8 million of liquidity that consisted of $51.8 million in cash and $13.0 million in combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our debt by a net amount of $91.0 million. Opco's $300.0 million revolving credit facility matures in October 2017, and as of December 31, 2015, we had $290.0 million outstanding thereunder. We borrowed $75.0 million under Opco's revolving credit facility in September 2015 in order to repay Opco's term loan in full. In October, 2015, the borrowing base under the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility was redetermined to $88.0 million, and we repaid $15.0 million under that facility, reducing our outstanding borrowings under that facility to $85.0 million. As of the date of this report, the combined borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities is $13.0 million.\nIn February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27%, or 139 million tons, of our hard mineral reserves as of December 31, 2015 for $10.0 million in cash. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves, or 1,094 MBoe, as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our current financial needs, we have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on Opco's senior notes each year through 2018, and our operating results continue to be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. In April 2015, we announced a long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the partnership for future growth. As part of that plan, we reduced our cash distributions during 2015 by over 87%. The cash savings resulting from the distribution reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We have also taken steps to reduce general and administrative and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts. However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our delevraging objectives and have determined to sell certain assets to help meet these objectives. While we have closed two asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected. For a more complete discussion of factors that will affect our liquidity, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nOpco's revolving credit facility matures in October 2017 and NRP's 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April 2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. Through February 2016, we completed asset sales for $47.5 million in gross proceeds. However, we believe the deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals. Traditionally, we have accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have the ability to access either the debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of companies with coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.\nGenerally, we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations. Our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $15.5 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to $80.8 million in principal payments\non Opco's senior notes due over the next year. Excluding these principal payments, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $65.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures, other than for acquisitions, have historically been minimal. However, as a result of our Sanish Field oil and gas and VantaCore aggregates acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014, our operating capital expenditures have been higher in 2015. In response to the significant decline in oil price, we expect our oil and gas capital expenditures to decline significantly in 2016 as compared to 2015. A portion of the capital expenditures associated with both our oil and gas working interest business and VantaCore are maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the long-term production capacity of those businesses. We deduct maintenance capital expenditures when calculating distributable cash flow. Total capital expenditures for NRP Oil and Gas for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $30.5 million. We continue to monitor the development programs of the operators of these properties and manage the capital expenditures associated with those properties by only participating in wells that are expected to provide acceptable economic returns. VantaCore's capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.0 million.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $203.4 million, $210.8 million and $247.1 million, respectively. The majority of our cash provided by operations is generated from coal royalty revenues, our equity interest in Ciner Wyoming as well as VantaCore and oil and gas revenues.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $30.3 million, $520.5 million and $302.8 million, respectively. During 2015 our investing activities primarily consisted of well participation costs within our Oil and Gas segment and plant and equipment acquisitions within our VantaCore segment. These 2015 investing cash outflows were partially offset by various asset sales including an aggregate preparation plant, cell phone tower lease contracts and condemnation payments within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment as well as sales of mineral rights within our Oil and Gas segment. Our 2014 investing activities consisted of our Sanish Field and VantaCore acquisitions, the $5.0 million Illinois Basin coal acquisition completed in June 2014, as well as additional capital expenditures related to the participation in new wells in connection with our Williston Basin non-operated oil and gas working interest properties. Our 2013 investing activities consisted of the acquisitions of the interest in Ciner Wyoming and two acquisitions of non-operated working interests in oil and gas properties located in the Williston Basin.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $171.5 million and net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $267.3 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.2 million. During 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had proceeds from loans of $100.0 million, $637.4 million and $567.0 million, respectively. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, these proceeds were offset by repayment of debt of $191.0 million, $328.0 million and $386.2 million, respectively. Also during 2015, 2014 and 2013 we paid cash distributions to our unitholders of $71.8 million, $162.0 million and $246.5 million, respectively. During 2014, we had net proceeds from an issuance of common units of $122.8 million, together with a capital contribution from our general partner of $3.2 million. During 2013, we had net proceeds from an issuance of common units of $74.7 million, together with a capital contribution from our general partner of $1.5 million.\nCapital Resources and Obligations\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had the following indebtedness (in thousands):\n\nWe were and continue to be in compliance with the terms of the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements. Adjusted EBITDA as defined in \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\" differs\nfrom the EBITDDA definitions contained in our debt agreements. For additional information regarding our debt and the agreements governing our debt, including the covenants contained therein, see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10. Debt and Debt-Affiliate\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLong-Term Contractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our long-term non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in millions):\n\n \n (1) The amounts indicated in the table include principal and interest due on NRP's 9.125% senior notes. \n (2) Does not consider the impact of any repayments required as a result of reductions in the borrowing base of the facility. \n (3) The amounts indicated in the table include principal due on Opco's senior notes, credit facility and utility local improvement obligation. \n (4) The amounts indicated in the table include interest due on Opco's senior notes and utility local improvement obligation. \n (5) On January 1, 2009, Opco entered into a ten-year lease agreement for the rental of office space from Western Pocahontas Properties Limited Partnership for $0.6 million per year. In addition, BRP LLC (\"BRP\") leases office space for approximately $0.1 million per year through 2017. These rental obligations are included in the table above. \nAnadarko Contingent Consideration Payment Claim\nThe purchase agreement for the acquisition of our interest in Ciner Wyoming, formerly OCI Wyoming, requires us to pay additional contingent consideration to Anadarko to the extent certain performance criteria described in the purchase agreement are met at Ciner Wyoming in any of the years 2013, 2014 or 2015. We paid $0.5 million and $3.8 million of consideration in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015, respectively, in satisfaction of our obligations under this agreement with respect to 2013 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate, and have recorded $7.2 million as the amount that will be payable in the first quarter of 2016 with respect to 2015. We have no obligation to pay contingent consideration with respect to any period after 2015.\nIn March 2014, Anadarko gave us written notice that it believed certain reorganization transactions conducted in 2013 within the OCI organization triggered an acceleration of our obligation to pay the additional contingent consideration in full and demanded immediate payment of such amount. We disagreed with Anadarko's position in a written response provided to Anadarko in April 2014. In April 2015, Anadarko sent a written request for additional information regarding the OCI reorganization and indicated that they are still considering this claim against us. We do not believe the reorganization transactions triggered an obligation to pay the additional contingent consideration. We responded in writing in May 2015, and we will continue to engage in discussions with Anadarko to resolve the issue if necessary. However, if Anadarko were to pursue and prevail on such a claim, we would be required to pay an amount to Anadarko in excess of the amounts already paid, together with the $7.2 million accrual described above, up to the maximum amount of the additional contingent consideration, minus a deductible. Under the purchase agreement, the maximum cumulative amount of additional contingent consideration is an amount equal to the net present value of $50.0 million. Any additional amount paid by us would be considered to be additional acquisition consideration and added to Equity and other unconsolidated investments and would reduce our liquidity.\nShelf Registration Statement\nIn September 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of common units.\nUnrestricted Subsidiary Information\nIn February 2016, NRP designated NRP Oil and Gas as an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture. In addition, BRP LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Coval Leasing Company, LLC, are also Unrestricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture. For more information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of NRP and its Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture separate from NRP's Unrestricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture, see \"Note 17. Supplementary Unrestricted Subsidiary Information\" under the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly, there are no off-balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities.\nInflation\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nFor additional information on environmental regulation that may have a material impact on our business, see \"-Executive Overview-Political, Legal and Regulatory Environment Affecting Our Coal Business\" and \"Item 1. Business-Regulation and Environmental Matters.\"\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe information required by this Item is included under \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12. Related Party Transactions\" and \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the reporting period. See \"Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Partnership's significant accounting policies. The following critical accounting policies are affected by estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenues\nCoal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other Revenues. Coal and hard mineral royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of mineral sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of mineral they sell. Processing fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material processed through the facilities by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees of the processing facilities make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of material that is processed and sold from the facilities. The processing leases are structured in a manner so that the lessees are responsible for operating and maintenance expenses associated with the facilities. Other revenues\ninclude transportation and processing fees. Transportation fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material transported over the beltlines. Under the terms of the transportation contracts, we receive a fixed price per ton for all material transported on the beltlines.\nSoda Ash Revenues. We account for non-marketable investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, an investee. Significant influence generally exists if we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. We account for our investment in Ciner Wyoming using this method.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and the proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. The basis difference between the investment and the proportional share of the fair value of the underlying net assets of equity method investees is hypothetically allocated first to identified tangible assets and liabilities, then to finite-lived intangibles or indefinite-lived intangibles and the remaining balance is attributed to goodwill. The portion of the basis difference attributed to net tangible assets and finite-lived intangibles is amortized over its estimated useful life while indefinite-lived intangibles, if any, and goodwill are not amortized. The amortization of the basis difference is recorded as a reduction of earnings from the equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOur carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption \"Equity and other unconsolidated investments\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our adjusted share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as revenues and other income under the caption \u2018\u2018Equity and other unconsolidated investment income.\" These earnings are generated from natural resources, which are considered part of our core business activities consistent with its directly owned revenue generating activities. Investee earnings are adjusted to reflect the amortization of any difference between the cost basis of the equity investment and the proportionate share of the investee's book value, which has been allocated to the fair value of net identified tangible and finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over the estimated lives of those assets.\nVantaCore Revenues. Revenues from the sale of aggregates, gravel, sand and asphalt are recorded based upon the transfer of product at delivery to customers, which generally occurs at the quarries or asphalt plants. Revenues from long-term construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. That method is used since we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, which result in revisions to job costs and profits are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Contract costs include all direct job costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, insurance, equipment maintenance and depreciation. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nOil and Gas Revenues. Oil and gas related revenues consist of revenues from our non-operated working interests, royalties and overriding royalties. Revenues related to our non-operated working interests in oil and gas assets are recognized on the basis of our net revenue interests in hydrocarbons produced. We also have capital expenditure and operating expenditure obligations associated with the non-operated working interests. Our revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas, the decline in production from producing wells, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate our wells, including the cost of development and production. Oil and gas royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Also, included within oil and gas royalties are lease bonus payments, which are generally paid upon the execution of a lease.\nDeferred Revenue\nMost of our coal and aggregates lessees must make minimum annual or quarterly payments which are generally recoupable over certain time periods. These minimum payments are recorded as deferred revenue when received. The deferred revenue attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as revenue when the lessee recoups the minimum payment through production or in the period immediately following the expiration of the lessee's ability to recoup the payments.\nLessee Audits and Inspections\nWe periodically audit lessee information by examining certain records and internal reports of our lessees. Our regional managers also perform periodic mine inspections to verify that the information that has been reported to us is accurate. The audit\nand inspection processes are designed to identify material variances from lease terms as well as differences between the information reported to us and the actual results from each property. Audits and inspections, however, are in periods subsequent to when the revenue is reported and any adjustment identified by these processes might be in a reporting period different from when the revenue was initially recorded. Typically there are no material adjustments from this process.\nShare-Based Payment\nWe account for awards relating to our Long-Term Incentive Plan using the fair value method, which requires us to estimate the fair value of the grant, and charge or credit the estimated fair value to expense over the service or vesting period of the grant based on fluctuations in our common unit price. In addition, estimated forfeitures are included in the periodic computation of the fair value of the liability and the fair value is recalculated at each reporting date over the service or vesting period of the grant.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have developed procedures to periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for possible impairment. These procedures are performed throughout the year and are based on historic, current and future performance and are designed to be early warning tests. If an asset fails one of the early warning tests, additional evaluation is performed for that asset that considers both quantitative and qualitative information. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the future expected undiscounted cash flows from its use and disposition is less than the assets' carrying value. Impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value, which is usually determined based upon the present value of the projected future cash flow compared to the assets' carrying value. We believe our estimates of cash flows and discount rates are consistent with those of principal market participants. In addition to the evaluations discussed above, specific events such as a reduction in economically recoverable reserves or production ceasing on a property for an extended period may require a separate impairment evaluation be completed on a significant property. As a result of the continued weakness in the coal markets and the potential for further declines in oil and natural gas prices, we intend to closely monitor our coal and oil and gas assets, and the impairment evaluation process may be completed more frequently if deemed necessary. Future impairment analyses could result in downward adjustments to the carrying value of our assets. During 2015, we recorded impairment expense of $676.1 million on certain of our mineral rights within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and Oil and Gas segments as well as plant and equipment within our Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other and VantaCore segments. For further discussion relating to our 2015 impairments see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 8. Minerals Rights\" and \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Plant and Equipment\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, management compares the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment loss. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, or upon the present value of expected cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nIn accordance with FASB accounting and disclosure guidance for goodwill, we test our recorded goodwill for impairment annually or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist, by determining if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Factors that could trigger an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in our overall business, industry, or economic trends. We recorded a $5.5 million impairment loss related to the VantaCore reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nFor purchase acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques.\nProved Oil and Gas Reserves\nThe Partnership utilizes Netherland Sewell, an independent reserve engineering firm, to estimate its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices are calculated using the unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing and then adjusted for transportation and other costs. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Netherland Sewell in their reserves estimation process.\nThe Partnership's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by Netherland Sewell and our internal staff of petroleum engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the applicable section of \"Item 8.

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- NRP had $64.8 million of liquidity at December 31, 2015, consisting of $51.8 million in cash and $13 million in available borrowing capacity. Debt was reduced by $91 million in 2015.\n- Significant debt maturities are approaching in 2017-2018 and leverage ratios need to be improved to enable refinancing. Asset sales and other actions are being pursued to strengthen the balance sheet. \n- Operating results continue to be negatively impacted by weak commodity markets. Additional asset impairments may occur if conditions further deteriorate.\n\nFinancial Results\n- 2015 revenues were $488.8 million. Net loss was $571.7 million, including $681.6 million of asset impairment charges. \n- Adjusted EBITDA was $292.1 million, essentially flat with 2014. Distributable cash flow was $197 million, down 5% from 2014.\n- Results were negatively impacted by lower coal prices and production. Oil and gas revenues also decreased due to lower prices, partially offset by increased production.\n\nOutlook\n- Coal and oil/gas markets are expected to remain challenging. Coal production cuts and mine closures may further impact NRP's properties.\n- Focus is on improving leverage, reducing debt, enhancing liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. Additional asset sales are likely needed.  \n- Ability to comply with financial covenants in debt agreements is sensitive to commodity prices and counterparty risks. If unable to complete asset sales or conditions deteriorate further, liquidity and covenant compliance would be adversely impacted.\n\nThe report discusses the current financial position, 2015 operating results, market conditions, and management's strategy and outlook for NRP's business. The key challenges are weak commodity markets, debt levels/maturities, liquidity, and ability to comply with debt covenants."}
