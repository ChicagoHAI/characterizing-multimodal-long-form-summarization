Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under \"Risks related to our business\" included in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the distribution of avocados, prepared avocado products, and other perishable food products throughout the United States. Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocados, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world. Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package guacamole and salsa and (iii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables, and prepared foods. We report our operations in three different business segments: Fresh products, Calavo Foods and RFG. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOur Fresh products business grades, sizes, packs, cools, and ripens (if desired) avocados for delivery to our customers. During fiscal 2018, we operated four packinghouses and four operating and distributing facilities (aka value-added depots or VADs) that handle avocados that are sold across the United States and to select international markets. We believe that our continued success in marketing avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We believe our diversified avocado sources help provide a level of relative supply stability that may, over time, serve to increase the availability and demand for avocados among consumers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have an impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. As a result of our investment in packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities, and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado volume. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various perishable foods, such as tomatoes and papayas, complement our offerings of avocados. From time to time, we continue to explore the distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to our business.\nOur Calavo Foods business processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products, and distributes the processed product to our customers. All of our prepared avocado products shipped to North America are cold pasteurized\u201d and include both frozen and fresh guacamole. Due to the high-quality, no preservative nature of our guacamole and the variety of packaging formats that we offer, we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today's foodservice and retail customers. Additionally, we also prepare various fresh salsa products. Our Calavo Foods segment maintains relationships with foodservice companies and food retailers. We continue to seek to expand our relationships with major foodservice companies and food retailers and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace.\nNet sales of frozen products represented approximately 41% and 47% of total processed segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. Net sales of our refrigerated products represented approximately 59% and 53% of total processed segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur RFG business produces, markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers sold through the retail channel. RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. RFG products are marketed under the Garden Highway\nFresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand and private label programs.\nThe operating results of all of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, including but not limited to pests and disease, weather patterns, changes in demand by consumers, food safety advisories impacting the fresh perishable food categories in which we currently operate, the timing of the receipt, reduction, or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products, our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products on a timely basis, the availability, quality and price of raw materials, new product introductions by our competitors, the utilization of production capacity at our various plant locations, change in the mix of products that our Fresh, Calavo Foods and RFG segments sell, and general economic conditions. We believe, however, that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). Except for certain provisions, the Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer with an October 31 fiscal year end, the majority of the new provisions, such as eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced income and introducing new limitations on certain business deductions, will not apply until our 2019 fiscal year. For fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include: lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; remeasuring certain net deferred tax assets and liabilities; and requiring the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. We recorded $1.7 million in one-time, non-cash charges related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets (approx. $1.4 million) and the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings (approx. $0.3 million).\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d) allowing taxpayers to record a reasonable estimate of the impact of the U.S. legislation when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, the estimated income tax charge of $2.3 million represents the Company's best estimate based on interpretation of the U.S. legislation. As a result, the actual impact on the net deferred tax liability may vary from the estimated amount due to uncertainties in the Company's preliminary review.\nThe Company recorded a provisional expense of approximately $0.3 million related to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. The transition tax is based on the Company's estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The actual transition tax due will be based on actual undistributed foreign earnings and cash and certain other specified assets as of the required measurement date, which could materially affect the amount of the transition tax. Accordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $0.3 million, net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has been recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPrior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company regularly determined certain foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities.\nDividend Payment\nOn October 2, 2018, the Company declared a $1.00 per share cash dividend to shareholders of record on November 16, 2018. On December 7, 2018, the Company paid this cash dividend, which totaled $17.6 million.\nLitigation\nWe were a named defendant in two class action lawsuits filed in superior state courts in California alleging violations of California wage-and-hour laws, failure to pay overtime, failure to pay for missed meal and rest periods, failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements, failure to pay all wages due at the time of termination or resignation, as well as statutory penalties for violation of the California Labor Code and Minimum Wage Order-2014.\nIn August 2017, the parties reached a tentative settlement of the case (pending court approval), whereby we agreed to pay $0.4 million to resolve the allegations and avoid further distraction that would result if the litigation continued. The Company recorded $0.4 million as a selling, general and administrative expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In August 2018, the court approved the settlement, and we paid $0.4 million.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nHowever, the outcome of all litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more of the lawsuits referred to in the paragraphs above is resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially and adversely affected.\nMexico tax audits\nWe conduct business internationally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal, U.S. state and certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, in the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities, primarily in Mexico and the U.S. During our third quarter of fiscal 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Calavo de Mexico (CDM), received a written communication from the Ministry of Finance and Administration of the government of the State of Michoacan, Mexico (MFM) containing preliminary observations related to a fiscal 2011 tax audit of such subsidiary. MFM's preliminary observations outline certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and Value Added Tax (VAT). During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, we provided a written rebuttal to MFM's preliminary observations and requested the adoption of a conclusive agreement before the PRODECON (Local Tax Ombudsman) so that a full discussion of the case between us, the MFM and the PRODECON, as appropriate, can lead to a reconsideration of the MFM findings. During our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017, several meetings between MFM, PRODECON and us took place and on November 28, 2017, the initial PRODECON process concluded. In April 2018, we filed a second formal agreement before the PRODECON, so that we can continue the discussion of the case between us, the MFM and the PRODECON. During this meeting and discussion period, the statutory period that MFM has in order to issue the tax assessment has been suspended. Currently, we are waiting for the response of the MFM and the PRODECON regarding our next meeting date. We believe we have the legal arguments and documentation to sustain the positions challenged by tax authorities.\nAdditionally, we also received notice from Mexico's Federal Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (SAT), that our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Calavo de Mexico, is currently under examination related to fiscal year 2013. In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from SAT outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and VAT. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017, which the SAT is in process of analyzing. During our third fiscal quarter of 2017, we requested the adoption of a conclusive agreement before the PRODECON (Local Tax Ombudsman), so that a full discussion of the case between us, the SAT and the PRODECON, as appropriate, can lead to a reconsideration of the SATs findings. During this meeting and\ndiscussion period, the statutory period that SAT had in order to issue the tax assessment was suspended. During our first fiscal quarter of 2018, we had an initial meeting with officials from the SAT and the PRODECON, which led to a further exchange of supporting information and documentation. Although several meetings and discussions with the PRODECON and the SAT were conducted during our fiscal third quarter, we were unable to materially resolve our case with the SAT through the PRODECON process.\nAs a result, on July 12, 2018, the SAT's local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment (the 2013 Assessment\u201d) totaling approximately $2.62 billion Mexican pesos related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and Value Added Tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit. Additionally, the tax authorities have determined an employee's profit sharing liability totaling approximately $118 million Mexican pesos as well.\nWe have consulted with both an internationally recognized tax advisor, as well as a global law firm with offices throughout Mexico, and we continue to believe this tax assessment is without merit. In August 2018, we filed an administrative appeal on the 2013 Assessment. The filing of an administrative appeal in Mexico is a process in which the taxpayer appeals to a different office within the Mexican tax authorities forcing the legal office within the SAT to rule on the matter. This process preserves the taxpayer's right to litigate in tax court if the administrative appeal process ends without a favorable or just resolution. Here, CDM has appealed our case to the SAT's central legal department in Mexico City. Furthermore, in August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT's central legal department in Mexico City on another tax matter (see footnote 15 regarding VAT refunds) indicating that they believe that our legal interpretation is accurate on a matter that is also central to the 2013 Assessment. We believe this recent ruling significantly undermines the 2013 Assessment we received in July 2018.\nWe continue to believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables, inventories, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, promotional allowances, equity income/losses and impairment analysis from unconsolidated entities, loans to unconsolidated entities, income taxes, retirement benefits, and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, we frequently engage third party valuation experts to assist us with estimates described below. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this Annual Report.\nWe believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nPromotional allowances. We provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale, based on our historical experience. Our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales. The derived percentage is then applied to the current period's sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period. The offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities. When certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional, they are written off against this allowance. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the\nperiod they are identified. We estimate that a one percent (100 basis point) change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately $1.2 million.\nIncome taxes. We account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies. Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be.\nThe application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from management's estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets. Goodwill, defined as unidentified asset(s) acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition, is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We can use a qualitative test, known as \"Step 0,\" or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In Step 0, we elect to perform an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the two step analysis. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we elected to implement Step 0 and were not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the reporting units. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses. The results of our Step 0 assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore we concluded that there were no impairments for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nInvestments. We account for non-marketable investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control, an investee. Significant influence generally exists when we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and our proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. In order to estimate the fair value of our investment in FreshRealm, we hired an independent third-party expert to provide their written opinion on the fair value of our investment. We reviewed and considered their independent expert opinion in making our determination.\nAllowance for accounts receivable. We provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income, expressed as percentages of our total net sales, for the periods indicated:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n11.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nWe believe that the fundamental consumption trends for our products continue to be favorable. Firstly, U.S. avocado demand continues to grow, with per capita use in 2017/18 reaching 7.5 pounds per person, up 6 percent from the previous year, and approximately double the estimate from a decade ago. We believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the U.S. contributes to such growth, as avocados, which are cholesterol and sodium free, dense in fiber, vitamin B6, antioxidants, potassium, folate, and contain unsaturated fat, which helps lower cholesterol. Also, a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients, which avocados are rich in, help fight chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer.\nAdditionally, we believe that the demographic changes in the U.S. will impact the consumption of avocados and avocado-based products. The Hispanic community currently accounts for approximately 18% of the U.S. population and the total number of Hispanics is estimated to double by the year 2050. Avocados are considered a staple item purchased by Hispanic consumers, as the per-capita avocado consumption in Mexico is significantly higher than that of the U.S.\nWe anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the United States marketplace, driven by year-round availability of imported fresh avocados, a rapidly growing Hispanic population, and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados. As one of the largest marketers of avocado products in the United States, we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow our Fresh products and Calavo Foods segments of our business. Additionally, we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in as interest in avocados continues to expand.\nIn October 2002, the USDA announced the creation of a Hass Avocado Board to promote the sale of Hass variety avocados in the U.S. marketplace. This board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the U.S. marketplace. The California Avocado Commission, which receives its funding from California avocado growers, has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales. We believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the U.S. will, in the long term, positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, on behalf of avocado growers, we remitted approximately $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $2.4 million to the California Avocado Commission. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we remitted approximately $6.9 million, $5.8 million and $8.2 million to the Hass Avocado Board related to avocados. Similarly, Avocados from Mexico (AFM) was formed in 2013 as the marketing arm of the Mexican Hass Avocados Importers Association (MHAIA) and the Association of Growers and Packers of Avocados From Mexico (APEAM). During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we remitted approximately $4.7 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million to APEAM primarily related to these marketing activities for Mexican avocados.\nWe also believe that our other fresh products, primarily tomatoes, are positioned for future growth.\nThe tomato is the fourth most popular fresh-market vegetable (though a fruit scientifically speaking, tomatoes are more commonly considered a vegetable) behind potatoes, lettuce, and onions in the U.S. Although stabilizing in the first decade of the 2000s, annual average fresh-market tomato consumption remains well above that of the previous decade. Over the past few decades, per capita use of tomatoes has been on the rise due to the enduring popularity of salads, salad bars, and submarine sandwiches. Perhaps of greater importance has been the introduction of improved and new tomato varieties, the increased development of hot-house grown tomatoes (such as those grown by our ADM affiliate), heightened consumer interest in a wider range of tomatoes, a surge of new immigrants who eat vegetable-intensive diets, and expanding national emphasis on health and nutrition.\nPapayas have become more popular as the consumption in the U.S. has more than doubled in the past decade. Papayas have high nutritional benefits. They are rich in anti-oxidants, the B vitamins, folate and pantothenic acid, potassium and magnesium; and fiber.\nAdditionally, through the acquisition of RFG, we substantially expanded and accelerated the Company's presence in the fast-growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category through an array of retail product lines for produce, deli, and foodservice departments. RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kits and salad kits. Value-added fruits and vegetables have continued to grow faster than their broader produce categories as consumers increasingly place value on the convenient nature of those products and producers like RFG continue to develop new formulations of value-added products. RFG has also expanded the capacity to provide products for a larger portion of the Fresh Deli department, which remains one of the fastest growing aisles in retail grocery.\nThe following tables set

The increase in sales, when compared to the same corresponding prior year periods, is related to growth from Calavo Foods and RFG, partially offset by a decrease in Fresh products.\nFor fiscal year 2018, Calavo Foods had our largest percentage increases in sales, followed by our RFG segment. Our Fresh product segment decreased, as shown above. The increase in Calavo Foods sales was due primarily to increased sales of our prepared avocado products. The increase in RFG sales was due primarily to increased sales from fresh prepared food, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products. The decrease in Fresh products sales was due primarily to a decrease in the per unit selling price of avocados. See discussion below for further details.\nAll three segments of our business are subject to seasonal trends, which can impact the volume and/or quality of fruit sourced in any particular quarter.\nNet sales to third parties by segment exclude value-added services billed by our Uruapan packinghouse and our Uruapan processing plant to the parent company. Additionally, net sales to third parties by segment exclude sales between Avocados de Jalisco and the parent company. All intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations.\nFresh products\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nNet sales delivered by the Fresh products business decreased by approximately $31.0 million, or 5%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017. This decrease in Fresh product sales during the year ended 2018 was primarily related to decreased sales of avocados, partially offset by increased sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados decreased $35.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same prior year period. Our volume of avocados sold during fiscal year 2018 increased by 57.7 million pounds, or 19%, compared to the prior year; however, this increase in sales volume was significantly offset by a 22% decrease in the average sales price per carton, when compared to the unusually high market prices experienced in fiscal 2017.\nSales of tomatoes increased to $30.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2018, compared to $27.9 million for the same period for fiscal 2017. The increase in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to an approximately 7% increase in the average sales price per carton, in addition to a 2% increase in volume of tomatoes sold during the year.\nWe anticipate that our sales volume of avocados will increase in fiscal 2019, due to a larger expected all-source avocado crop, when compared to the same prior year period.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nNet sales delivered by the Fresh products business increased by approximately $44.0 million, or 8%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to fiscal 2016. As discussed above, this increase in Fresh product sales during fiscal 2017 was primarily related to increased sales of avocados, which was partially offset by decreased sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados increased $53.4 million, or 11%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase in avocado sales was primarily due to an increase in the sales price per carton of 46.0%, compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in sales price per carton was partially offset by a decrease in volume of avocados sold of 88.4 million pounds, or 23%. We attribute much of the change in price to market conditions during the year, in which consumer demand continued to exceed available industry supply.\nSales of tomatoes decreased to $27.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2017, compared to $36.0 million for the same period for fiscal 2016. The decrease in sales of tomatoes was due to a decrease in the sales price per carton of approximately 24% due primarily to a change in weather patterns which resulted in wider availability of tomatoes in the market.\nCalavo Foods\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nSales for Calavo Foods for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017, increased $13.8 million, or 19%. Sales of prepared avocado products increased by approximately $14.4 million, or 20%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same prior year period, resulting from increases in both the average sales price per pound and the total volume of pounds sold. Partially offsetting this gain were sales of salsa products, which decreased by approximately $0.6 million during the year.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nSales for Calavo Foods for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2016, increased $10.9 million, or 17%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of prepared avocado products of approximately $10.8 million, or 18%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase in sales of prepared avocado products was related to an increase in overall pounds sold and the price per pound.\nRFG\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nSales for RFG for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017, increased $30.4 million, or 7%. The overall increase in sales is primarily due to higher sales from expanded retail partnerships in multiple geographies, most notably in a few regions in which the Company has added production capacity.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nSales for RFG for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2016, increased $85.0 million, or 26%. This increase was due primarily to increased sales from prepared foods, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products. The overall increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in sales volume, which we believe results from our ability to develop new retail relationships and expand current retail partnerships into additional geographies and product categories as we continue to build out our national manufacturing capabilities.\nGross Profit\nThe following table summarizes our gross profit and gross profit percentages by business segment:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross Profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFresh products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalavo Foods\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n97.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRFG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n107,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit percentages:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFresh products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalavo Foods\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRFG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary\nOur cost of goods sold consists predominantly of ingredient costs (primarily fruit and other whole foods), packing materials, freight and handling, labor and overhead (including depreciation) associated with preparing food products, and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold. Gross profit decreased by approximately $0.9 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a gross profit decrease in our Fresh products segment, partially offset by increases in our Calavo Foods and RFG segments.\nFresh products\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nDuring our year ended October 31, 2018, as compared to the same prior year period, the decrease in our Fresh products segment gross profit percentage was the result of decreased profit for avocados, partially offset by an increase in tomatoes. For the year ended October 31, 2018, compared to the same prior year period, the gross profit percentage for avocados decreased to 9.7% in 2018 from 12.7% in 2017. The decrease during fiscal 2018 was primarily related to the unusual market supply conditions experienced last year in which consumer demand greatly exceeded market supply, and higher year-over-year freight costs. Note that any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profits for our Fresh products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2018 we generated gross profit of $3.2 million from tomato sales, up from $2.7 million in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in tomato gross profit was due primarily to the year-over-year increase in sales described in more detail earlier. The majority of our tomato sales are done on a consignment basis, in which the gross profit we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party, which usually is a percent of the overall selling price; however, we also purchase some tomatoes on the spot market to meet specific customer requests and have certain fixed overhead costs associated with our tomato operations which impact the overall\ngross profit realized from tomato sales. The gross profit percentage for consignment sales are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle, the average selling prices, and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third-party growers/packers.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nDuring fiscal 2017, as compared to the same prior year period, the increase in our Fresh products segment gross profit percentage was the result of increased profit for avocados, partially offset by a decreased profit for tomatoes. For the year ended October 31, 2017, compared to the same prior year period, the gross profit percentage for avocados increased from 10.9% in 2016 to a gross profit percentage of 12.7% in 2017. The profit improvement during fiscal 2017, was primarily the result of management's focus and execution on continuous improvement across the operation which helped to complement the current market conditions, in which consumer demand continued to exceed available industry supply. In addition, U.S. Dollar to Mexican Peso exchange rate was stronger in fiscal 2017, when compared to fiscal 2016. Note that any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our Fresh products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2017 we generated gross profit of $2.7 million from tomato sales, down 36.3% from $4.2 million in the corresponding prior year period. The decline in tomato gross profit is due primarily to a decrease in the sales price per carton of approximately 24%.\nCalavo Foods\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nCalavo Foods gross profit percentage increased to 29.8% of net sales, during the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to 17.9% during the same prior year period. The increase in Calavo Foods gross profit percentage was due primarily to increased gross profit of our prepared avocado products. The increase in gross profit and margin for our prepared avocado products was primarily due to higher sales, as well as fruit costs that were below last year's record-high fruit costs. Note that any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Calavo Foods segments.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nThe Calavo Foods segment gross profit percentage during our year ended October 31, 2017 decreased to 17.9%, compared to the same prior year period gross profit percentage of 35.4%. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in fruit input costs for the year ended October 31, 2017, as compared to the same period year period. Note that any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Calavo Foods segments.\nRFG\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nRFG's gross profit percentage for the year ended October 31, 2018 was 7.4%, compared to 6.9% in the same prior year period. The gross profit improvement for the year ended October 31, 2018, was due primarily to higher net sales and manufacturing efficiencies generated across the segment's manufacturing footprint, as well as lower raw material costs.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nRFG's gross profit percentage during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was 6.9%, compared 8.1% in the same prior year period. This lower gross profit percentage was primarily the result of additional costs incurred during the year associated with growth initiatives currently underway for the segment. Specifically, these costs relate to the start-up and\nramping up periods at new or recently expanded RFG plants, as well as higher costs related to the development and optimization of new product categories. The gross profit of fiscal 2017 was enhanced, in part, by a change in the presentation of broker commission expenses, totaling $3.0 million in fiscal 2017, which was moved to selling, general and administrative expense, rather than shown as a reduction in net sales, as was done in prior year. Without the broker commission impact, gross profit would have decreased $1.2 million for year ended October 31, 2017 when compared to the same prior year period.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $57.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2018 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs, as well as $0.9 million of management transition related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017.\nThis increase was primarily related to approximately $3.3 million increase in salaries and benefits ($1.6 million of costs related to the vesting of stock grants earned by certain members of the senior management team over the past three fiscal years, as well as $1.7 million due in part to higher headcount). Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in bad debt (approximately $1.3 million), a decrease in accrued management bonuses (approximately $0.6 million) and a decrease in legal fees (approximately $0.5 million) for year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.2 million, or 22%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. This increase was partly related to three factors that do not reflect changes in the overall cost structure of the Company, specifically a change in presentation of broker commissions (approximately $3.0 million) to include such costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, which had historically been presented as a reduction in net sales, non-recurring expenses related to the resignation and retirement of two corporate officers (approximately $1.2 million) and a $0.4 million settlement (see Note 7 for further information). In addition to these items, the increase was related to an increase in salaries and benefits (approximately $2.3 million, due in part to higher headcount), an increase in bad debt (approximately $1.2 million), and an increase in stock based compensation (approximately $1.0 million) and legal fees (approximately $0.2 million), which were partially offset by a decrease in accrued management bonuses (approximately $0.6 million).\nIncome (loss) from Unconsolidated Entities\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(11,850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3055.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n170.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(570)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities includes our allocation of earnings or losses from our investments in FreshRealm and Don Memo.

For fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to lower average debt balance, offset by higher LIBOR interest rates. For fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, the increase in interest expense was primarily related to higher average debt balance due primarily to the purchase of property in Riverside, California and other capital expenditures, as well as higher LIBOR rates which increased our interest rate.\nOther Income, Net\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income, net includes dividend income, as well as certain other transactions that are outside of the normal course of operations.

$48.4 million, $62.1 million and $62.0 million. Fiscal year 2018 operating cash flows reflect our net income of $32.0 million, net increase of noncash charges (depreciation and amortization, income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, provision for losses on accounts receivable, deferred income taxes, and stock compensation expense) of $34.5 million and a net decrease from changes in the non-cash components of our working capital accounts of approximately $18.1 million.\nFiscal year 2018 decreases in operating cash flows, caused by working capital changes, includes a decrease in trade accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities of $8.0 million, an increase in inventory of $4.1 million, an increase in other assets of $3.1 million, a decrease in payable to growers of $2.5 million, an increase in income tax receivable of $2.1 million, an increase in advances to suppliers of $1.0 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.7 million, partially offset by, a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.6 million.\nThe decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily related to a decrease in our payables related to RFG. The increase in our inventory balance is primarily related to an increase of guacamole on hand at October 31, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. The increase in other assets is due to an increase in Mexican IVA tax receivable (see Note 15 to our consolidated condensed financial statements). The decrease in payable to our growers primarily reflects a decrease in our Mexican avocado grower payable due to lower avocado prices in October 2018 compared to October 2017. The increase in advances to suppliers is mainly due to an increase in advances to our tomato growers in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in our accounts receivable, as of October 31, 2018 when compared to October 31, 2017, primarily reflects more receivable collections in the month of October 2018, as compared to October 2017.\nCash used in investing activities was $30.2 million, $53.7 million and $21.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Fiscal year 2018 cash flows used in investing activities include capital expenditures of $15.0 million of property, plant and equipment. It also includes loans to FreshRealm of $11.5 million, an additional investment in FreshRealm of $3.5 million, an infrastructure loan to Agricola Belher of $3.0 million, and additional investment in Agricola Don Memo of $0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of a loan to FreshRealm of $2.5 million and the repayment of loans to San Rafael of $0.4 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $23.3 million, $15.7 million and $33.6 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Cash used during fiscal year 2018 primarily to the payment of our $16.7 million dividend, payments on our credit facilities totaling $5.0 million, and the payment of minimum withholding taxes on net share settlement of equity awards of $1.6 million.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash reserves, cash generated from operations and amounts available for borrowing under our existing credit facilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.5 million and $6.6 million. Our working capital at October 31, 2018 was $29.6 million, compared to $3.7 million at October 31, 2017.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations and the available Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditures, grower recruitment efforts, working capital and other financing requirements for the next twelve months. We will continue to evaluate grower recruitment opportunities, expanded relationships with retail and club customers, and exclusivity arrangements with food service companies to fuel growth in each of our business segments. We have a revolving credit facility with Bank of America as administrative agent and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. as joint lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and Farm Credit West, as joint lead arranger. Under the terms of this agreement, we are advanced funds for both working capital and long-term productive asset purchases. Total credit available under this agreement is $80 million, and will expire in June 2021. Upon notice to Bank of America, we may from time to time, request an increase in the Credit Facility by an amount not exceeding $50 million. For our line of credit the weighted-average interest rate was 3.4% and 2.2% at October 31, 2018 and 2017. Under this credit facility, we had $15.0 million and $20.0 million outstanding as of October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThis Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type, including the following financial covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis: (a) a quarterly consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 and (b) a quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all such covenants at October 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations pursuant to which we are required to make cash payments.

The assessments are primarily for advertising and promotions. The amount of the assessment is based on the dollars paid to the growers for their fruit, and, as a result, is not determinable until the value of the payments to the growers has been calculated.\nAmounts remitted to the Hass Avocado Board (HAB) in connection with their assessment program are likewise not determinable until the fruit is actually delivered to us. HAB assessments are primarily used to fund marketing and promotion efforts.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The guidance clarifies that modification accounting will be applied if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award changes. The Company adopted this new standard at the beginning of fiscal 2018. The adoption of the amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The FASB is issuing this update to simplify the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. We are evaluating the impact of the update of this ASU on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and, as such, we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the \"Act\"). In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. This ASU is effective for us the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and, as such, we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which adds guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this ASU to have an impact until an applicable transaction takes place.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which will require companies to recognize the income tax effects of intra-entity sales and transfers of assets other than inventory, particularly those asset transfers involving intellectual property, in the period in which the transfer occurs. The ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2019 fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact upon adoption.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. The ASU permits an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2021 fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Leases, which requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would\nrecognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity's leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Although we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements, we currently expect the most significant changes will be related to the recognition of material new long-term right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim period within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated statements of income depends on the net unrealized gain or loss on our equity investment. For the year ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, the net unrealized gain on our equity investment was $2.2 million and $6.3 million which relates solely to our investment in Limoneira.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard is intended to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition. During fiscal 2017, the FASB issued additional clarification guidance on the new revenue recognition standard which also included certain scope improvements and practical expedients. The standard (including clarification guidance issued) is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be our first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective transition method, under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the first day of our 2019 fiscal year. This standard will not have material impact on our results of operations or financial position.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under \"Risks related to our business\" included in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the distribution of avocados, prepared avocado products, and other perishable food products throughout the United States. Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocados, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world. Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package guacamole and salsa and (iii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables, and prepared foods. We report our operations in three different business segments: Fresh products, Calavo Foods and RFG. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOur Fresh products business grades, sizes, packs, cools, and ripens (if desired) avocados for delivery to our customers. During fiscal 2018, we operated four packinghouses and four operating and distributing facilities (aka value-added depots or VADs) that handle avocados that are sold across the United States and to select international markets. We believe that our continued success in marketing avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We believe our diversified avocado sources help provide a level of relative supply stability that may, over time, serve to increase the availability and demand for avocados among consumers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have an impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. As a result of our investment in packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities, and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado volume. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various perishable foods, such as tomatoes and papayas, complement our offerings of avocados. From time to time, we continue to explore the distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to our business.\nOur Calavo Foods business processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products, and distributes the processed product to our customers. All of our prepared avocado products shipped to North America are cold pasteurized\u201d and include both frozen and fresh guacamole. Due to the high-quality, no preservative nature of our guacamole and the variety of packaging formats that we offer, we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today's foodservice and retail customers. Additionally, we also prepare various fresh salsa products. Our Calavo Foods segment maintains relationships with foodservice companies and food retailers. We continue to seek to expand our relationships with major foodservice companies and food retailers and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace.\nNet sales of frozen products represented approximately 41% and 47% of total processed segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. Net sales of our refrigerated products represented approximately 59% and 53% of total processed segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur RFG business produces, markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers sold through the retail channel. RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. RFG products are marketed under the Garden Highway\nFresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand and private label programs.\nThe operating results of all of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, including but not limited to pests and disease, weather patterns, changes in demand by consumers, food safety advisories impacting the fresh perishable food categories in which we currently operate, the timing of the receipt, reduction, or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products, our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products on a timely basis, the availability, quality and price of raw materials, new product introductions by our competitors, the utilization of production capacity at our various plant locations, change in the mix of products that our Fresh, Calavo Foods and RFG segments sell, and general economic conditions. We believe, however, that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). Except for certain provisions, the Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer with an October 31 fiscal year end, the majority of the new provisions, such as eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced income and introducing new limitations on certain business deductions, will not apply until our 2019 fiscal year. For fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include: lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; remeasuring certain net deferred tax assets and liabilities; and requiring the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. We recorded $1.7 million in one-time, non-cash charges related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets (approx. $1.4 million) and the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings (approx. $0.3 million).\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d) allowing taxpayers to record a reasonable estimate of the impact of the U.S. legislation when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, the estimated income tax charge of $2.3 million represents the Company's best estimate based on interpretation of the U.S. legislation. As a result, the actual impact on the net deferred tax liability may vary from the estimated amount due to uncertainties in the Company's preliminary review.\nThe Company recorded a provisional expense of approximately $0.3 million related to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. The transition tax is based on the Company's estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The actual transition tax due will be based on actual undistributed foreign earnings and cash and certain other specified assets as of the required measurement date, which could materially affect the amount of the transition tax. Accordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $0.3 million, net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has been recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPrior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company regularly determined certain foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities.\nDividend Payment\nOn October 2, 2018, the Company declared a $1.00 per share cash dividend to shareholders of record on November 16, 2018. On December 7, 2018, the Company paid this cash dividend, which totaled $17.6 million.\nLitigation\nWe were a named defendant in two class action lawsuits filed in superior state courts in California alleging violations of California wage-and-hour laws, failure to pay overtime, failure to pay for missed meal and rest periods, failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements, failure to pay all wages due at the time of termination or resignation, as well as statutory penalties for violation of the California Labor Code and Minimum Wage Order-2014.\nIn August 2017, the parties reached a tentative settlement of the case (pending court approval), whereby we agreed to pay $0.4 million to resolve the allegations and avoid further distraction that would result if the litigation continued. The Company recorded $0.4 million as a selling, general and administrative expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In August 2018, the court approved the settlement, and we paid $0.4 million.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nHowever, the outcome of all litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more of the lawsuits referred to in the paragraphs above is resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially and adversely affected.\nMexico tax audits\nWe conduct business internationally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal, U.S. state and certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, in the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities, primarily in Mexico and the U.S. During our third quarter of fiscal 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Calavo de Mexico (CDM), received a written communication from the Ministry of Finance and Administration of the government of the State of Michoacan, Mexico (MFM) containing preliminary observations related to a fiscal 2011 tax audit of such subsidiary. MFM's preliminary observations outline certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and Value Added Tax (VAT). During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, we provided a written rebuttal to MFM's preliminary observations and requested the adoption of a conclusive agreement before the PRODECON (Local Tax Ombudsman) so that a full discussion of the case between us, the MFM and the PRODECON, as appropriate, can lead to a reconsideration of the MFM findings. During our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017, several meetings between MFM, PRODECON and us took place and on November 28, 2017, the initial PRODECON process concluded. In April 2018, we filed a second formal agreement before the PRODECON, so that we can continue the discussion of the case between us, the MFM and the PRODECON. During this meeting and discussion period, the statutory period that MFM has in order to issue the tax assessment has been suspended. Currently, we are waiting for the response of the MFM and the PRODECON regarding our next meeting date. We believe we have the legal arguments and documentation to sustain the positions challenged by tax authorities.\nAdditionally, we also received notice from Mexico's Federal Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (SAT), that our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Calavo de Mexico, is currently under examination related to fiscal year 2013. In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from SAT outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and VAT. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017, which the SAT is in process of analyzing. During our third fiscal quarter of 2017, we requested the adoption of a conclusive agreement before the PRODECON (Local Tax Ombudsman), so that a full discussion of the case between us, the SAT and the PRODECON, as appropriate, can lead to a reconsideration of the SATs findings. During this meeting and\ndiscussion period, the statutory period that SAT had in order to issue the tax assessment was suspended. During our first fiscal quarter of 2018, we had an initial meeting with officials from the SAT and the PRODECON, which led to a further exchange of supporting information and documentation. Although several meetings and discussions with the PRODECON and the SAT were conducted during our fiscal third quarter, we were unable to materially resolve our case with the SAT through the PRODECON process.\nAs a result, on July 12, 2018, the SAT's local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment (the 2013 Assessment\u201d) totaling approximately $2.62 billion Mexican pesos related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and Value Added Tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit. Additionally, the tax authorities have determined an employee's profit sharing liability totaling approximately $118 million Mexican pesos as well.\nWe have consulted with both an internationally recognized tax advisor, as well as a global law firm with offices throughout Mexico, and we continue to believe this tax assessment is without merit. In August 2018, we filed an administrative appeal on the 2013 Assessment. The filing of an administrative appeal in Mexico is a process in which the taxpayer appeals to a different office within the Mexican tax authorities forcing the legal office within the SAT to rule on the matter. This process preserves the taxpayer's right to litigate in tax court if the administrative appeal process ends without a favorable or just resolution. Here, CDM has appealed our case to the SAT's central legal department in Mexico City. Furthermore, in August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT's central legal department in Mexico City on another tax matter (see footnote 15 regarding VAT refunds) indicating that they believe that our legal interpretation is accurate on a matter that is also central to the 2013 Assessment. We believe this recent ruling significantly undermines the 2013 Assessment we received in July 2018.\nWe continue to believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables, inventories, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, promotional allowances, equity income/losses and impairment analysis from unconsolidated entities, loans to unconsolidated entities, income taxes, retirement benefits, and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, we frequently engage third party valuation experts to assist us with estimates described below. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this Annual Report.\nWe believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nPromotional allowances. We provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale, based on our historical experience. Our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales. The derived percentage is then applied to the current period's sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period. The offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities. When certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional, they are written off against this allowance. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the\nperiod they are identified. We estimate that a one percent (100 basis point) change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately $1.2 million.\nIncome taxes. We account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies. Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be.\nThe application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from management's estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets. Goodwill, defined as unidentified asset(s) acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition, is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We can use a qualitative test, known as \"Step 0,\" or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In Step 0, we elect to perform an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the two step analysis. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we elected to implement Step 0 and were not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the reporting units. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses. The results of our Step 0 assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore we concluded that there were no impairments for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nInvestments. We account for non-marketable investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control, an investee. Significant influence generally exists when we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and our proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. In order to estimate the fair value of our investment in FreshRealm, we hired an independent third-party expert to provide their written opinion on the fair value of our investment. We reviewed and considered their independent expert opinion in making our determination.\nAllowance for accounts receivable. We provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income, expressed as percentages of our total net sales, for the periods indicated:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n11.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n5.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nWe believe that the fundamental consumption trends for our products continue to be favorable. Firstly, U.S. avocado demand continues to grow, with per capita use in 2017/18 reaching 7.5 pounds per person, up 6 percent from the previous year, and approximately double the estimate from a decade ago. We believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the U.S. contributes to such growth, as avocados, which are cholesterol and sodium free, dense in fiber, vitamin B6, antioxidants, potassium, folate, and contain unsaturated fat, which helps lower cholesterol. Also, a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients, which avocados are rich in, help fight chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer.\nAdditionally, we believe that the demographic changes in the U.S. will impact the consumption of avocados and avocado-based products. The Hispanic community currently accounts for approximately 18% of the U.S. population and the total number of Hispanics is estimated to double by the year 2050. Avocados are considered a staple item purchased by Hispanic consumers, as the per-capita avocado consumption in Mexico is significantly higher than that of the U.S.\nWe anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the United States marketplace, driven by year-round availability of imported fresh avocados, a rapidly growing Hispanic population, and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados. As one of the largest marketers of avocado products in the United States, we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow our Fresh products and Calavo Foods segments of our business. Additionally, we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in as interest in avocados continues to expand.\nIn October 2002, the USDA announced the creation of a Hass Avocado Board to promote the sale of Hass variety avocados in the U.S. marketplace. This board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the U.S. marketplace. The California Avocado Commission, which receives its funding from California avocado growers, has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales. We believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the U.S. will, in the long term, positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, on behalf of avocado growers, we remitted approximately $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $2.4 million to the California Avocado Commission. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we remitted approximately $6.9 million, $5.8 million and $8.2 million to the Hass Avocado Board related to avocados. Similarly, Avocados from Mexico (AFM) was formed in 2013 as the marketing arm of the Mexican Hass Avocados Importers Association (MHAIA) and the Association of Growers and Packers of Avocados From Mexico (APEAM). During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we remitted approximately $4.7 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million to APEAM primarily related to these marketing activities for Mexican avocados.\nWe also believe that our other fresh products, primarily tomatoes, are positioned for future growth.\nThe tomato is the fourth most popular fresh-market vegetable (though a fruit scientifically speaking, tomatoes are more commonly considered a vegetable) behind potatoes, lettuce, and onions in the U.S. Although stabilizing in the first decade of the 2000s, annual average fresh-market tomato consumption remains well above that of the previous decade. Over the past few decades, per capita use of tomatoes has been on the rise due to the enduring popularity of salads, salad bars, and submarine sandwiches. Perhaps of greater importance has been the introduction of improved and new tomato varieties, the increased development of hot-house grown tomatoes (such as those grown by our ADM affiliate), heightened consumer interest in a wider range of tomatoes, a surge of new immigrants who eat vegetable-intensive diets, and expanding national emphasis on health and nutrition.\nPapayas have become more popular as the consumption in the U.S. has more than doubled in the past decade. Papayas have high nutritional benefits. They are rich in anti-oxidants, the B vitamins, folate and pantothenic acid, potassium and magnesium; and fiber.\nAdditionally, through the acquisition of RFG, we substantially expanded and accelerated the Company's presence in the fast-growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category through an array of retail product lines for produce, deli, and foodservice departments. RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kits and salad kits. Value-added fruits and vegetables have continued to grow faster than their broader produce categories as consumers increasingly place value on the convenient nature of those products and producers like RFG continue to develop new formulations of value-added products. RFG has also expanded the capacity to provide products for a larger portion of the Fresh Deli department, which remains one of the fastest growing aisles in retail grocery.\nThe following tables set

The increase in sales, when compared to the same corresponding prior year periods, is related to growth from Calavo Foods and RFG, partially offset by a decrease in Fresh products.\nFor fiscal year 2018, Calavo Foods had our largest percentage increases in sales, followed by our RFG segment. Our Fresh product segment decreased, as shown above. The increase in Calavo Foods sales was due primarily to increased sales of our prepared avocado products. The increase in RFG sales was due primarily to increased sales from fresh prepared food, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products. The decrease in Fresh products sales was due primarily to a decrease in the per unit selling price of avocados. See discussion below for further details.\nAll three segments of our business are subject to seasonal trends, which can impact the volume and/or quality of fruit sourced in any particular quarter.\nNet sales to third parties by segment exclude value-added services billed by our Uruapan packinghouse and our Uruapan processing plant to the parent company. Additionally, net sales to third parties by segment exclude sales between Avocados de Jalisco and the parent company. All intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations.\nFresh products\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nNet sales delivered by the Fresh products business decreased by approximately $31.0 million, or 5%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017. This decrease in Fresh product sales during the year ended 2018 was primarily related to decreased sales of avocados, partially offset by increased sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados decreased $35.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same prior year period. Our volume of avocados sold during fiscal year 2018 increased by 57.7 million pounds, or 19%, compared to the prior year; however, this increase in sales volume was significantly offset by a 22% decrease in the average sales price per carton, when compared to the unusually high market prices experienced in fiscal 2017.\nSales of tomatoes increased to $30.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2018, compared to $27.9 million for the same period for fiscal 2017. The increase in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to an approximately 7% increase in the average sales price per carton, in addition to a 2% increase in volume of tomatoes sold during the year.\nWe anticipate that our sales volume of avocados will increase in fiscal 2019, due to a larger expected all-source avocado crop, when compared to the same prior year period.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nNet sales delivered by the Fresh products business increased by approximately $44.0 million, or 8%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to fiscal 2016. As discussed above, this increase in Fresh product sales during fiscal 2017 was primarily related to increased sales of avocados, which was partially offset by decreased sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados increased $53.4 million, or 11%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase in avocado sales was primarily due to an increase in the sales price per carton of 46.0%, compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in sales price per carton was partially offset by a decrease in volume of avocados sold of 88.4 million pounds, or 23%. We attribute much of the change in price to market conditions during the year, in which consumer demand continued to exceed available industry supply.\nSales of tomatoes decreased to $27.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2017, compared to $36.0 million for the same period for fiscal 2016. The decrease in sales of tomatoes was due to a decrease in the sales price per carton of approximately 24% due primarily to a change in weather patterns which resulted in wider availability of tomatoes in the market.\nCalavo Foods\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nSales for Calavo Foods for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017, increased $13.8 million, or 19%. Sales of prepared avocado products increased by approximately $14.4 million, or 20%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same prior year period, resulting from increases in both the average sales price per pound and the total volume of pounds sold. Partially offsetting this gain were sales of salsa products, which decreased by approximately $0.6 million during the year.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nSales for Calavo Foods for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2016, increased $10.9 million, or 17%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of prepared avocado products of approximately $10.8 million, or 18%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase in sales of prepared avocado products was related to an increase in overall pounds sold and the price per pound.\nRFG\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nSales for RFG for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017, increased $30.4 million, or 7%. The overall increase in sales is primarily due to higher sales from expanded retail partnerships in multiple geographies, most notably in a few regions in which the Company has added production capacity.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nSales for RFG for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2016, increased $85.0 million, or 26%. This increase was due primarily to increased sales from prepared foods, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products. The overall increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in sales volume, which we believe results from our ability to develop new retail relationships and expand current retail partnerships into additional geographies and product categories as we continue to build out our national manufacturing capabilities.\nGross Profit\nThe following table summarizes our gross profit and gross profit percentages by business segment:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross Profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFresh products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalavo Foods\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n97.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRFG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n107,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit percentages:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFresh products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCalavo Foods\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRFG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary\nOur cost of goods sold consists predominantly of ingredient costs (primarily fruit and other whole foods), packing materials, freight and handling, labor and overhead (including depreciation) associated with preparing food products, and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold. Gross profit decreased by approximately $0.9 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a gross profit decrease in our Fresh products segment, partially offset by increases in our Calavo Foods and RFG segments.\nFresh products\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nDuring our year ended October 31, 2018, as compared to the same prior year period, the decrease in our Fresh products segment gross profit percentage was the result of decreased profit for avocados, partially offset by an increase in tomatoes. For the year ended October 31, 2018, compared to the same prior year period, the gross profit percentage for avocados decreased to 9.7% in 2018 from 12.7% in 2017. The decrease during fiscal 2018 was primarily related to the unusual market supply conditions experienced last year in which consumer demand greatly exceeded market supply, and higher year-over-year freight costs. Note that any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profits for our Fresh products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2018 we generated gross profit of $3.2 million from tomato sales, up from $2.7 million in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in tomato gross profit was due primarily to the year-over-year increase in sales described in more detail earlier. The majority of our tomato sales are done on a consignment basis, in which the gross profit we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party, which usually is a percent of the overall selling price; however, we also purchase some tomatoes on the spot market to meet specific customer requests and have certain fixed overhead costs associated with our tomato operations which impact the overall\ngross profit realized from tomato sales. The gross profit percentage for consignment sales are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle, the average selling prices, and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third-party growers/packers.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nDuring fiscal 2017, as compared to the same prior year period, the increase in our Fresh products segment gross profit percentage was the result of increased profit for avocados, partially offset by a decreased profit for tomatoes. For the year ended October 31, 2017, compared to the same prior year period, the gross profit percentage for avocados increased from 10.9% in 2016 to a gross profit percentage of 12.7% in 2017. The profit improvement during fiscal 2017, was primarily the result of management's focus and execution on continuous improvement across the operation which helped to complement the current market conditions, in which consumer demand continued to exceed available industry supply. In addition, U.S. Dollar to Mexican Peso exchange rate was stronger in fiscal 2017, when compared to fiscal 2016. Note that any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our Fresh products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2017 we generated gross profit of $2.7 million from tomato sales, down 36.3% from $4.2 million in the corresponding prior year period. The decline in tomato gross profit is due primarily to a decrease in the sales price per carton of approximately 24%.\nCalavo Foods\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nCalavo Foods gross profit percentage increased to 29.8% of net sales, during the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to 17.9% during the same prior year period. The increase in Calavo Foods gross profit percentage was due primarily to increased gross profit of our prepared avocado products. The increase in gross profit and margin for our prepared avocado products was primarily due to higher sales, as well as fruit costs that were below last year's record-high fruit costs. Note that any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Calavo Foods segments.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nThe Calavo Foods segment gross profit percentage during our year ended October 31, 2017 decreased to 17.9%, compared to the same prior year period gross profit percentage of 35.4%. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in fruit input costs for the year ended October 31, 2017, as compared to the same period year period. Note that any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Calavo Foods segments.\nRFG\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nRFG's gross profit percentage for the year ended October 31, 2018 was 7.4%, compared to 6.9% in the same prior year period. The gross profit improvement for the year ended October 31, 2018, was due primarily to higher net sales and manufacturing efficiencies generated across the segment's manufacturing footprint, as well as lower raw material costs.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nRFG's gross profit percentage during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was 6.9%, compared 8.1% in the same prior year period. This lower gross profit percentage was primarily the result of additional costs incurred during the year associated with growth initiatives currently underway for the segment. Specifically, these costs relate to the start-up and\nramping up periods at new or recently expanded RFG plants, as well as higher costs related to the development and optimization of new product categories. The gross profit of fiscal 2017 was enhanced, in part, by a change in the presentation of broker commission expenses, totaling $3.0 million in fiscal 2017, which was moved to selling, general and administrative expense, rather than shown as a reduction in net sales, as was done in prior year. Without the broker commission impact, gross profit would have decreased $1.2 million for year ended October 31, 2017 when compared to the same prior year period.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $57.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2018 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs, as well as $0.9 million of management transition related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017.\nThis increase was primarily related to approximately $3.3 million increase in salaries and benefits ($1.6 million of costs related to the vesting of stock grants earned by certain members of the senior management team over the past three fiscal years, as well as $1.7 million due in part to higher headcount). Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in bad debt (approximately $1.3 million), a decrease in accrued management bonuses (approximately $0.6 million) and a decrease in legal fees (approximately $0.5 million) for year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.2 million, or 22%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. This increase was partly related to three factors that do not reflect changes in the overall cost structure of the Company, specifically a change in presentation of broker commissions (approximately $3.0 million) to include such costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, which had historically been presented as a reduction in net sales, non-recurring expenses related to the resignation and retirement of two corporate officers (approximately $1.2 million) and a $0.4 million settlement (see Note 7 for further information). In addition to these items, the increase was related to an increase in salaries and benefits (approximately $2.3 million, due in part to higher headcount), an increase in bad debt (approximately $1.2 million), and an increase in stock based compensation (approximately $1.0 million) and legal fees (approximately $0.2 million), which were partially offset by a decrease in accrued management bonuses (approximately $0.6 million).\nIncome (loss) from Unconsolidated Entities\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(11,850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3055.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n170.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(570)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities includes our allocation of earnings or losses from our investments in FreshRealm and Don Memo.

For fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to lower average debt balance, offset by higher LIBOR interest rates. For fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, the increase in interest expense was primarily related to higher average debt balance due primarily to the purchase of property in Riverside, California and other capital expenditures, as well as higher LIBOR rates which increased our interest rate.\nOther Income, Net\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income, net includes dividend income, as well as certain other transactions that are outside of the normal course of operations.

$48.4 million, $62.1 million and $62.0 million. Fiscal year 2018 operating cash flows reflect our net income of $32.0 million, net increase of noncash charges (depreciation and amortization, income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, provision for losses on accounts receivable, deferred income taxes, and stock compensation expense) of $34.5 million and a net decrease from changes in the non-cash components of our working capital accounts of approximately $18.1 million.\nFiscal year 2018 decreases in operating cash flows, caused by working capital changes, includes a decrease in trade accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities of $8.0 million, an increase in inventory of $4.1 million, an increase in other assets of $3.1 million, a decrease in payable to growers of $2.5 million, an increase in income tax receivable of $2.1 million, an increase in advances to suppliers of $1.0 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.7 million, partially offset by, a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.6 million.\nThe decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily related to a decrease in our payables related to RFG. The increase in our inventory balance is primarily related to an increase of guacamole on hand at October 31, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. The increase in other assets is due to an increase in Mexican IVA tax receivable (see Note 15 to our consolidated condensed financial statements). The decrease in payable to our growers primarily reflects a decrease in our Mexican avocado grower payable due to lower avocado prices in October 2018 compared to October 2017. The increase in advances to suppliers is mainly due to an increase in advances to our tomato growers in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in our accounts receivable, as of October 31, 2018 when compared to October 31, 2017, primarily reflects more receivable collections in the month of October 2018, as compared to October 2017.\nCash used in investing activities was $30.2 million, $53.7 million and $21.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Fiscal year 2018 cash flows used in investing activities include capital expenditures of $15.0 million of property, plant and equipment. It also includes loans to FreshRealm of $11.5 million, an additional investment in FreshRealm of $3.5 million, an infrastructure loan to Agricola Belher of $3.0 million, and additional investment in Agricola Don Memo of $0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of a loan to FreshRealm of $2.5 million and the repayment of loans to San Rafael of $0.4 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $23.3 million, $15.7 million and $33.6 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Cash used during fiscal year 2018 primarily to the payment of our $16.7 million dividend, payments on our credit facilities totaling $5.0 million, and the payment of minimum withholding taxes on net share settlement of equity awards of $1.6 million.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash reserves, cash generated from operations and amounts available for borrowing under our existing credit facilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.5 million and $6.6 million. Our working capital at October 31, 2018 was $29.6 million, compared to $3.7 million at October 31, 2017.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations and the available Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditures, grower recruitment efforts, working capital and other financing requirements for the next twelve months. We will continue to evaluate grower recruitment opportunities, expanded relationships with retail and club customers, and exclusivity arrangements with food service companies to fuel growth in each of our business segments. We have a revolving credit facility with Bank of America as administrative agent and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. as joint lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and Farm Credit West, as joint lead arranger. Under the terms of this agreement, we are advanced funds for both working capital and long-term productive asset purchases. Total credit available under this agreement is $80 million, and will expire in June 2021. Upon notice to Bank of America, we may from time to time, request an increase in the Credit Facility by an amount not exceeding $50 million. For our line of credit the weighted-average interest rate was 3.4% and 2.2% at October 31, 2018 and 2017. Under this credit facility, we had $15.0 million and $20.0 million outstanding as of October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThis Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type, including the following financial covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis: (a) a quarterly consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 and (b) a quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all such covenants at October 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations pursuant to which we are required to make cash payments.

The assessments are primarily for advertising and promotions. The amount of the assessment is based on the dollars paid to the growers for their fruit, and, as a result, is not determinable until the value of the payments to the growers has been calculated.\nAmounts remitted to the Hass Avocado Board (HAB) in connection with their assessment program are likewise not determinable until the fruit is actually delivered to us. HAB assessments are primarily used to fund marketing and promotion efforts.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The guidance clarifies that modification accounting will be applied if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award changes. The Company adopted this new standard at the beginning of fiscal 2018. The adoption of the amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The FASB is issuing this update to simplify the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. We are evaluating the impact of the update of this ASU on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and, as such, we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the \"Act\"). In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. This ASU is effective for us the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and, as such, we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which adds guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this ASU to have an impact until an applicable transaction takes place.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which will require companies to recognize the income tax effects of intra-entity sales and transfers of assets other than inventory, particularly those asset transfers involving intellectual property, in the period in which the transfer occurs. The ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2019 fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact upon adoption.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. The ASU permits an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2021 fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Leases, which requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would\nrecognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity's leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Although we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements, we currently expect the most significant changes will be related to the recognition of material new long-term right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim period within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated statements of income depends on the net unrealized gain or loss on our equity investment. For the year ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, the net unrealized gain on our equity investment was $2.2 million and $6.3 million which relates solely to our investment in Limoneira.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard is intended to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition. During fiscal 2017, the FASB issued additional clarification guidance on the new revenue recognition standard which also included certain scope improvements and practical expedients. The standard (including clarification guidance issued) is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be our first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective transition method, under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the first day of our 2019 fiscal year. This standard will not have material impact on our results of operations or financial position.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under \"Risks related to our business\" included in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the distribution of avocados, prepared avocado products, and other perishable food products throughout the United States. Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocados, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world. Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package guacamole and salsa and (iii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables, and prepared foods. We report our operations in three different business segments: Fresh products, Calavo Foods and RFG. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOur Fresh products business grades, sizes, packs, cools, and ripens (if desired) avocados for delivery to our customers. During fiscal 2018, we operated four packinghouses and four operating and distributing facilities (aka value-added depots or VADs) that handle avocados that are sold across the United States and to select international markets. We believe that our continued success in marketing avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We believe our diversified avocado sources help provide a level of relative supply stability that may, over time, serve to increase the availability and demand for avocados among consumers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have an impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. As a result of our investment in packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities, and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado volume. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various perishable foods, such as tomatoes and papayas, complement our offerings of avocados. From time to time, we continue to explore the distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to our business.\nOur Calavo Foods business processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products, and distributes the processed product to our customers. All of our prepared avocado products shipped to North America are cold pasteurized\u201d and include both frozen and fresh guacamole. Due to the high-quality, no preservative nature of our guacamole and the variety of packaging formats that we offer, we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today's foodservice and retail customers. Additionally, we also prepare various fresh salsa products. Our Calavo Foods segment maintains relationships with foodservice companies and food retailers. We continue to seek to expand our relationships with major foodservice companies and food retailers and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace.\nNet sales of frozen products represented approximately 41% and 47% of total processed segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. Net sales of our refrigerated products represented approximately 59% and 53% of total processed segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur RFG business produces, markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers sold through the retail channel. RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. RFG products are marketed under the Garden Highway\nFresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand and private label programs.\nThe operating results of all of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, including but not limited to pests and disease, weather patterns, changes in demand by consumers, food safety advisories impacting the fresh perishable food categories in which we currently operate, the timing of the receipt, reduction, or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products, our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products on a timely basis, the availability, quality and price of raw materials, new product introductions by our competitors, the utilization of production capacity at our various plant locations, change in the mix of products that our Fresh, Calavo Foods and RFG segments sell, and general economic conditions. We believe, however, that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). Except for certain provisions, the Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer with an October 31 fiscal year end, the majority of the new provisions, such as eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced income and introducing new limitations on certain business deductions, will not apply until our 2019 fiscal year. For fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include: lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; remeasuring certain net deferred tax assets and liabilities; and requiring the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. We recorded $1.7 million in one-time, non-cash charges related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets (approx. $1.4 million) and the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings (approx. $0.3 million).\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d) allowing taxpayers to record a reasonable estimate of the impact of the U.S. legislation when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, the estimated income tax charge of $2.3 million represents the Company's best estimate based on interpretation of the U.S. legislation. As a result, the actual impact on the net deferred tax liability may vary from the estimated amount due to uncertainties in the Company's preliminary review.\nThe Company recorded a provisional expense of approximately $0.3 million related to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. The transition tax is based on the Company's estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The actual transition tax due will be based on actual undistributed foreign earnings and cash and certain other specified assets as of the required measurement date, which could materially affect the amount of the transition tax. Accordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $0.3 million, net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has been recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPrior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company regularly determined certain foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities.\nDividend Payment\nOn October 2, 2018, the Company declared a $1.00 per share cash dividend to shareholders of record on November 16, 2018. On December 7, 2018, the Company paid this cash dividend, which totaled $17.6 million.\nLitigation\nWe were a named defendant in two class action lawsuits filed in superior state courts in California alleging violations of California wage-and-hour laws, failure to pay overtime, failure to pay for missed meal and rest periods, failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements, failure to pay all wages due at the time of termination or resignation, as well as statutory penalties for violation of the California Labor Code and Minimum Wage Order-2014.\nIn August 2017, the parties reached a tentative settlement of the case (pending court approval), whereby we agreed to pay $0.4 million to resolve the allegations and avoid further distraction that would result if the litigation continued. The Company recorded $0.4 million as a selling, general and administrative expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In August 2018, the court approved the settlement, and we paid $0.4 million.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nHowever, the outcome of all litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more of the lawsuits referred to in the paragraphs above is resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially and adversely affected.\nMexico tax audits\nWe conduct business internationally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in U.S. federal, U.S. state and certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, in the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities, primarily in Mexico and the U.S. During our third quarter of fiscal 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Calavo de Mexico (CDM), received a written communication from the Ministry of Finance and Administration of the government of the State of Michoacan, Mexico (MFM) containing preliminary observations related to a fiscal 2011 tax audit of such subsidiary. MFM's preliminary observations outline certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and Value Added Tax (VAT). During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, we provided a written rebuttal to MFM's preliminary observations and requested the adoption of a conclusive agreement before the PRODECON (Local Tax Ombudsman) so that a full discussion of the case between us, the MFM and the PRODECON, as appropriate, can lead to a reconsideration of the MFM findings. During our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017, several meetings between MFM, PRODECON and us took place and on November 28, 2017, the initial PRODECON process concluded. In April 2018, we filed a second formal agreement before the PRODECON, so that we can continue the discussion of the case between us, the MFM and the PRODECON. During this meeting and discussion period, the statutory period that MFM has in order to issue the tax assessment has been suspended. Currently, we are waiting for the response of the MFM and the PRODECON regarding our next meeting date. We believe we have the legal arguments and documentation to sustain the positions challenged by tax authorities.\nAdditionally, we also received notice from Mexico's Federal Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (SAT), that our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Calavo de Mexico, is currently under examination related to fiscal year 2013. In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from SAT outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and VAT. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017, which the SAT is in process of analyzing. During our third fiscal quarter of 2017, we requested the adoption of a conclusive agreement before the PRODECON (Local Tax Ombudsman), so that a full discussion of the case between us, the SAT and the PRODECON, as appropriate, can lead to a reconsideration of the SATs findings. During this meeting and\ndiscussion period, the statutory period that SAT had in order to issue the tax assessment was suspended. During our first fiscal quarter of 2018, we had an initial meeting with officials from the SAT and the PRODECON, which led to a further exchange of supporting information and documentation. Although several meetings and discussions with the PRODECON and the SAT were conducted during our fiscal third quarter, we were unable to materially resolve our case with the SAT through the PRODECON process.\nAs a result, on July 12, 2018, the SAT's local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment (the 2013 Assessment\u201d) totaling approximately $2.62 billion Mexican pesos related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and Value Added Tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit. Additionally, the tax authorities have determined an employee's profit sharing liability totaling approximately $118 million Mexican pesos as well.\nWe have consulted with both an internationally recognized tax advisor, as well as a global law firm with offices throughout Mexico, and we continue to believe this tax assessment is without merit. In August 2018, we filed an administrative appeal on the 2013 Assessment. The filing of an administrative appeal in Mexico is a process in which the taxpayer appeals to a different office within the Mexican tax authorities forcing the legal office within the SAT to rule on the matter. This process preserves the taxpayer's right to litigate in tax court if the administrative appeal process ends without a favorable or just resolution. Here, CDM has appealed our case to the SAT's central legal department in Mexico City. Furthermore, in August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT's central legal department in Mexico City on another tax matter (see footnote 15 regarding VAT refunds) indicating that they believe that our legal interpretation is accurate on a matter that is also central to the 2013 Assessment. We believe this recent ruling significantly undermines the 2013 Assessment we received in July 2018.\nWe continue to believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables, inventories, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, promotional allowances, equity income/losses and impairment analysis from unconsolidated entities, loans to unconsolidated entities, income taxes, retirement benefits, and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, we frequently engage third party valuation experts to assist us with estimates described below. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this Annual Report.\nWe believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nPromotional allowances. We provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale, based on our historical experience. Our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales. The derived percentage is then applied to the current period's sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period. The offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities. When certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional, they are written off against this allowance. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the\nperiod they are identified. We estimate that a one percent (100 basis point) change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately $1.2 million.\nIncome taxes. We account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies. Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be.\nThe application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from management's estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets. Goodwill, defined as unidentified asset(s) acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition, is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We can use a qualitative test, known as \"Step 0,\" or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In Step 0, we elect to perform an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the two step analysis. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we elected to implement Step 0 and were not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the reporting units. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses. The results of our Step 0 assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore we concluded that there were no impairments for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nInvestments. We account for non-marketable investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control, an investee. Significant influence generally exists when we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and our proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. In order to estimate the fair value of our investment in FreshRealm, we hired an independent third-party expert to provide their written opinion on the fair value of our investment. We reviewed and considered their independent expert opinion in making our determination.\nAllowance for accounts receivable. We provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income, expressed as percentages of our total net sales, for the periods indicated:\n\nNet Sales\nWe believe that the fundamental consumption trends for our products continue to be favorable. Firstly, U.S. avocado demand continues to grow, with per capita use in 2017/18 reaching 7.5 pounds per person, up 6 percent from the previous year, and approximately double the estimate from a decade ago. We believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the U.S. contributes to such growth, as avocados, which are cholesterol and sodium free, dense in fiber, vitamin B6, antioxidants, potassium, folate, and contain unsaturated fat, which helps lower cholesterol. Also, a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients, which avocados are rich in, help fight chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer.\nAdditionally, we believe that the demographic changes in the U.S. will impact the consumption of avocados and avocado-based products. The Hispanic community currently accounts for approximately 18% of the U.S. population and the total number of Hispanics is estimated to double by the year 2050. Avocados are considered a staple item purchased by Hispanic consumers, as the per-capita avocado consumption in Mexico is significantly higher than that of the U.S.\nWe anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the United States marketplace, driven by year-round availability of imported fresh avocados, a rapidly growing Hispanic population, and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados. As one of the largest marketers of avocado products in the United States, we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow our Fresh products and Calavo Foods segments of our business. Additionally, we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in as interest in avocados continues to expand.\nIn October 2002, the USDA announced the creation of a Hass Avocado Board to promote the sale of Hass variety avocados in the U.S. marketplace. This board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the U.S. marketplace. The California Avocado Commission, which receives its funding from California avocado growers, has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales. We believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the U.S. will, in the long term, positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, on behalf of avocado growers, we remitted approximately $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $2.4 million to the California Avocado Commission. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we remitted approximately $6.9 million, $5.8 million and $8.2 million to the Hass Avocado Board related to avocados. Similarly, Avocados from Mexico (AFM) was formed in 2013 as the marketing arm of the Mexican Hass Avocados Importers Association (MHAIA) and the Association of Growers and Packers of Avocados From Mexico (APEAM). During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we remitted approximately $4.7 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million to APEAM primarily related to these marketing activities for Mexican avocados.\nWe also believe that our other fresh products, primarily tomatoes, are positioned for future growth.\nThe tomato is the fourth most popular fresh-market vegetable (though a fruit scientifically speaking, tomatoes are more commonly considered a vegetable) behind potatoes, lettuce, and onions in the U.S. Although stabilizing in the first decade of the 2000s, annual average fresh-market tomato consumption remains well above that of the previous decade. Over the past few decades, per capita use of tomatoes has been on the rise due to the enduring popularity of salads, salad bars, and submarine sandwiches. Perhaps of greater importance has been the introduction of improved and new tomato varieties, the increased development of hot-house grown tomatoes (such as those grown by our ADM affiliate), heightened consumer interest in a wider range of tomatoes, a surge of new immigrants who eat vegetable-intensive diets, and expanding national emphasis on health and nutrition.\nPapayas have become more popular as the consumption in the U.S. has more than doubled in the past decade. Papayas have high nutritional benefits. They are rich in anti-oxidants, the B vitamins, folate and pantothenic acid, potassium and magnesium; and fiber.\nAdditionally, through the acquisition of RFG, we substantially expanded and accelerated the Company's presence in the fast-growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category through an array of retail product lines for produce, deli, and foodservice departments. RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kits and salad kits. Value-added fruits and vegetables have continued to grow faster than their broader produce categories as consumers increasingly place value on the convenient nature of those products and producers like RFG continue to develop new formulations of value-added products. RFG has also expanded the capacity to provide products for a larger portion of the Fresh Deli department, which remains one of the fastest growing aisles in retail grocery.\nThe following tables set forth sales by product category and sales incentives, by segment (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nNet sales to third parties by segment exclude inter-segment sales and cost of sales. For fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016, inter-segment sales and cost of sales of $1.6 million, $1.3 million and $4.3 million between Fresh products and\nRFG were eliminated. For fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016, inter-segment sales and cost of sales of $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $2.7 million between Calavo Foods and RFG were eliminated.\nThe following table summarizes our net sales by business segment:\n\nSummary\nNet sales for the year ended October 31, 2018, as compared to 2017, increased by $13.2 million, or 1.2%. The increase in sales, when compared to the same corresponding prior year periods, is related to growth from Calavo Foods and RFG, partially offset by a decrease in Fresh products.\nFor fiscal year 2018, Calavo Foods had our largest percentage increases in sales, followed by our RFG segment. Our Fresh product segment decreased, as shown above. The increase in Calavo Foods sales was due primarily to increased sales of our prepared avocado products. The increase in RFG sales was due primarily to increased sales from fresh prepared food, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products. The decrease in Fresh products sales was due primarily to a decrease in the per unit selling price of avocados. See discussion below for further details.\nAll three segments of our business are subject to seasonal trends, which can impact the volume and/or quality of fruit sourced in any particular quarter.\nNet sales to third parties by segment exclude value-added services billed by our Uruapan packinghouse and our Uruapan processing plant to the parent company. Additionally, net sales to third parties by segment exclude sales between Avocados de Jalisco and the parent company. All intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations.\nFresh products\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nNet sales delivered by the Fresh products business decreased by approximately $31.0 million, or 5%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017. This decrease in Fresh product sales during the year ended 2018 was primarily related to decreased sales of avocados, partially offset by increased sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados decreased $35.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same prior year period. Our volume of avocados sold during fiscal year 2018 increased by 57.7 million pounds, or 19%, compared to the prior year; however, this increase in sales volume was significantly offset by a 22% decrease in the average sales price per carton, when compared to the unusually high market prices experienced in fiscal 2017.\nSales of tomatoes increased to $30.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2018, compared to $27.9 million for the same period for fiscal 2017. The increase in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to an approximately 7% increase in the average sales price per carton, in addition to a 2% increase in volume of tomatoes sold during the year.\nWe anticipate that our sales volume of avocados will increase in fiscal 2019, due to a larger expected all-source avocado crop, when compared to the same prior year period.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nNet sales delivered by the Fresh products business increased by approximately $44.0 million, or 8%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to fiscal 2016. As discussed above, this increase in Fresh product sales during fiscal 2017 was primarily related to increased sales of avocados, which was partially offset by decreased sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados increased $53.4 million, or 11%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase in avocado sales was primarily due to an increase in the sales price per carton of 46.0%, compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in sales price per carton was partially offset by a decrease in volume of avocados sold of 88.4 million pounds, or 23%. We attribute much of the change in price to market conditions during the year, in which consumer demand continued to exceed available industry supply.\nSales of tomatoes decreased to $27.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2017, compared to $36.0 million for the same period for fiscal 2016. The decrease in sales of tomatoes was due to a decrease in the sales price per carton of approximately 24% due primarily to a change in weather patterns which resulted in wider availability of tomatoes in the market.\nCalavo Foods\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nSales for Calavo Foods for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017, increased $13.8 million, or 19%. Sales of prepared avocado products increased by approximately $14.4 million, or 20%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same prior year period, resulting from increases in both the average sales price per pound and the total volume of pounds sold. Partially offsetting this gain were sales of salsa products, which decreased by approximately $0.6 million during the year.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nSales for Calavo Foods for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2016, increased $10.9 million, or 17%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of prepared avocado products of approximately $10.8 million, or 18%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase in sales of prepared avocado products was related to an increase in overall pounds sold and the price per pound.\nRFG\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nSales for RFG for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017, increased $30.4 million, or 7%. The overall increase in sales is primarily due to higher sales from expanded retail partnerships in multiple geographies, most notably in a few regions in which the Company has added production capacity.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nSales for RFG for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2016, increased $85.0 million, or 26%. This increase was due primarily to increased sales from prepared foods, fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products. The overall increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in sales volume, which we believe results from our ability to develop new retail relationships and expand current retail partnerships into additional geographies and product categories as we continue to build out our national manufacturing capabilities.\nGross Profit\nThe following table summarizes our gross profit and gross profit percentages by business segment:\n\nSummary\nOur cost of goods sold consists predominantly of ingredient costs (primarily fruit and other whole foods), packing materials, freight and handling, labor and overhead (including depreciation) associated with preparing food products, and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold. Gross profit decreased by approximately $0.9 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a gross profit decrease in our Fresh products segment, partially offset by increases in our Calavo Foods and RFG segments.\nFresh products\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nDuring our year ended October 31, 2018, as compared to the same prior year period, the decrease in our Fresh products segment gross profit percentage was the result of decreased profit for avocados, partially offset by an increase in tomatoes. For the year ended October 31, 2018, compared to the same prior year period, the gross profit percentage for avocados decreased to 9.7% in 2018 from 12.7% in 2017. The decrease during fiscal 2018 was primarily related to the unusual market supply conditions experienced last year in which consumer demand greatly exceeded market supply, and higher year-over-year freight costs. Note that any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profits for our Fresh products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2018 we generated gross profit of $3.2 million from tomato sales, up from $2.7 million in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in tomato gross profit was due primarily to the year-over-year increase in sales described in more detail earlier. The majority of our tomato sales are done on a consignment basis, in which the gross profit we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party, which usually is a percent of the overall selling price; however, we also purchase some tomatoes on the spot market to meet specific customer requests and have certain fixed overhead costs associated with our tomato operations which impact the overall\ngross profit realized from tomato sales. The gross profit percentage for consignment sales are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle, the average selling prices, and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third-party growers/packers.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nDuring fiscal 2017, as compared to the same prior year period, the increase in our Fresh products segment gross profit percentage was the result of increased profit for avocados, partially offset by a decreased profit for tomatoes. For the year ended October 31, 2017, compared to the same prior year period, the gross profit percentage for avocados increased from 10.9% in 2016 to a gross profit percentage of 12.7% in 2017. The profit improvement during fiscal 2017, was primarily the result of management's focus and execution on continuous improvement across the operation which helped to complement the current market conditions, in which consumer demand continued to exceed available industry supply. In addition, U.S. Dollar to Mexican Peso exchange rate was stronger in fiscal 2017, when compared to fiscal 2016. Note that any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our Fresh products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2017 we generated gross profit of $2.7 million from tomato sales, down 36.3% from $4.2 million in the corresponding prior year period. The decline in tomato gross profit is due primarily to a decrease in the sales price per carton of approximately 24%.\nCalavo Foods\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nCalavo Foods gross profit percentage increased to 29.8% of net sales, during the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to 17.9% during the same prior year period. The increase in Calavo Foods gross profit percentage was due primarily to increased gross profit of our prepared avocado products. The increase in gross profit and margin for our prepared avocado products was primarily due to higher sales, as well as fruit costs that were below last year's record-high fruit costs. Note that any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Calavo Foods segments.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nThe Calavo Foods segment gross profit percentage during our year ended October 31, 2017 decreased to 17.9%, compared to the same prior year period gross profit percentage of 35.4%. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in fruit input costs for the year ended October 31, 2017, as compared to the same period year period. Note that any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Calavo Foods segments.\nRFG\nFiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017:\nRFG's gross profit percentage for the year ended October 31, 2018 was 7.4%, compared to 6.9% in the same prior year period. The gross profit improvement for the year ended October 31, 2018, was due primarily to higher net sales and manufacturing efficiencies generated across the segment's manufacturing footprint, as well as lower raw material costs.\nFiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016:\nRFG's gross profit percentage during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was 6.9%, compared 8.1% in the same prior year period. This lower gross profit percentage was primarily the result of additional costs incurred during the year associated with growth initiatives currently underway for the segment. Specifically, these costs relate to the start-up and\nramping up periods at new or recently expanded RFG plants, as well as higher costs related to the development and optimization of new product categories. The gross profit of fiscal 2017 was enhanced, in part, by a change in the presentation of broker commission expenses, totaling $3.0 million in fiscal 2017, which was moved to selling, general and administrative expense, rather than shown as a reduction in net sales, as was done in prior year. Without the broker commission impact, gross profit would have decreased $1.2 million for year ended October 31, 2017 when compared to the same prior year period.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $57.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2018 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs, as well as $0.9 million of management transition related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017.\nThis increase was primarily related to approximately $3.3 million increase in salaries and benefits ($1.6 million of costs related to the vesting of stock grants earned by certain members of the senior management team over the past three fiscal years, as well as $1.7 million due in part to higher headcount). Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in bad debt (approximately $1.3 million), a decrease in accrued management bonuses (approximately $0.6 million) and a decrease in legal fees (approximately $0.5 million) for year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to the same period for fiscal 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.2 million, or 22%, for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to the same prior year period. This increase was partly related to three factors that do not reflect changes in the overall cost structure of the Company, specifically a change in presentation of broker commissions (approximately $3.0 million) to include such costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, which had historically been presented as a reduction in net sales, non-recurring expenses related to the resignation and retirement of two corporate officers (approximately $1.2 million) and a $0.4 million settlement (see Note 7 for further information). In addition to these items, the increase was related to an increase in salaries and benefits (approximately $2.3 million, due in part to higher headcount), an increase in bad debt (approximately $1.2 million), and an increase in stock based compensation (approximately $1.0 million) and legal fees (approximately $0.2 million), which were partially offset by a decrease in accrued management bonuses (approximately $0.6 million).\nIncome (loss) from Unconsolidated Entities\n\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities includes our allocation of earnings or losses from our investments in FreshRealm and Don Memo. For the year ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $0.2 million of income and $0.4 of income related to Don Memo. For the year ended October 31, 2018, we recognized $12.0 million of losses related to FreshRealm. While we are unable to determine with certainty the future operating results of FreshRealm and future non-Calavo investments, if any, we anticipate recording additional non-cash losses from FreshRealm during fiscal 2019. See Note 16 in our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nInterest Income\n\nThe increase in interest income in fiscal 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to the loans to FreshRealm in fiscal 2018. See the related party footnote in our consolidated financial statements for further information. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to the loans to California avocado growers decreasing in the current year compared to the prior year.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense is primarily generated from our line of credit borrowings with Farm Credit West, PCA (FCW) and Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America), as well as our former term loan agreements with FCW and Bank of America (prior to June 2016). For fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to lower average debt balance, offset by higher LIBOR interest rates. For fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, the increase in interest expense was primarily related to higher average debt balance due primarily to the purchase of property in Riverside, California and other capital expenditures, as well as higher LIBOR rates which increased our interest rate.\nOther Income, Net\n\nOther income, net includes dividend income, as well as certain other transactions that are outside of the normal course of operations. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million as dividend income from Limoneira.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nOur tax provision is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete taxable events that may occur during the quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded $1.7 million in one-time, non-cash charges related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets (approx. $1.4 million) and the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings (approx. $0.3 million). In addition, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, pursuant to ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting. We recognize the effects of tax legislation in the period in which the law is enacted. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years we estimate the related temporary differences to reverse. Based on the Tax Act and a change accelerating certain tax deductions on our 2017 federal tax return, we recorded $0.8 million of a tax benefit as a discrete item during our third fiscal quarter of 2018. Additionally, we also recorded approximately $0.2 million of tax\nexpense related to return to provision differences upon the filing of the 2017 tax return during our third fiscal quarter of 2018.\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest\n\nFor fiscal 2018, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is due to a loss from Avocados de Jalisco. For fiscal 2016, the noncontrolling interest for Salsa Lisa is recorded at the greater of the noncontrolling interest balance adjusted for the attribution of loss or the amount redeemable pursuant to the buyout process contained in the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Calavo Salsa Lisa LLC. For fiscal 2016, we recorded an adjustment of $486,000 to increase the noncontrolling interest balance to the currently expected redeemable amount of $771,000. This adjustment has been included in net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest. See Note 2 in our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended October 31, 2018. The information for each of these quarters is derived from our unaudited interim financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In our opinion, all necessary adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring accruals, have been included to fairly present our unaudited quarterly results.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating activities for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 provided cash flows of $48.4 million, $62.1 million and $62.0 million. Fiscal year 2018 operating cash flows reflect our net income of $32.0 million, net increase of noncash charges (depreciation and amortization, income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, provision for losses on accounts receivable, deferred income taxes, and stock compensation expense) of $34.5 million and a net decrease from changes in the non-cash components of our working capital accounts of approximately $18.1 million.\nFiscal year 2018 decreases in operating cash flows, caused by working capital changes, includes a decrease in trade accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities of $8.0 million, an increase in inventory of $4.1 million, an increase in other assets of $3.1 million, a decrease in payable to growers of $2.5 million, an increase in income tax receivable of $2.1 million, an increase in advances to suppliers of $1.0 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.7 million, partially offset by, a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.6 million.\nThe decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily related to a decrease in our payables related to RFG. The increase in our inventory balance is primarily related to an increase of guacamole on hand at October 31, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. The increase in other assets is due to an increase in Mexican IVA tax receivable (see Note 15 to our consolidated condensed financial statements). The decrease in payable to our growers primarily reflects a decrease in our Mexican avocado grower payable due to lower avocado prices in October 2018 compared to October 2017. The increase in advances to suppliers is mainly due to an increase in advances to our tomato growers in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in our accounts receivable, as of October 31, 2018 when compared to October 31, 2017, primarily reflects more receivable collections in the month of October 2018, as compared to October 2017.\nCash used in investing activities was $30.2 million, $53.7 million and $21.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Fiscal year 2018 cash flows used in investing activities include capital expenditures of $15.0 million of property, plant and equipment. It also includes loans to FreshRealm of $11.5 million, an additional investment in FreshRealm of $3.5 million, an infrastructure loan to Agricola Belher of $3.0 million, and additional investment in Agricola Don Memo of $0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of a loan to FreshRealm of $2.5 million and the repayment of loans to San Rafael of $0.4 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $23.3 million, $15.7 million and $33.6 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Cash used during fiscal year 2018 primarily to the payment of our $16.7 million dividend, payments on our credit facilities totaling $5.0 million, and the payment of minimum withholding taxes on net share settlement of equity awards of $1.6 million.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash reserves, cash generated from operations and amounts available for borrowing under our existing credit facilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.5 million and $6.6 million. Our working capital at October 31, 2018 was $29.6 million, compared to $3.7 million at October 31, 2017.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations and the available Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditures, grower recruitment efforts, working capital and other financing requirements for the next twelve months. We will continue to evaluate grower recruitment opportunities, expanded relationships with retail and club customers, and exclusivity arrangements with food service companies to fuel growth in each of our business segments. We have a revolving credit facility with Bank of America as administrative agent and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. as joint lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and Farm Credit West, as joint lead arranger. Under the terms of this agreement, we are advanced funds for both working capital and long-term productive asset purchases. Total credit available under this agreement is $80 million, and will expire in June 2021. Upon notice to Bank of America, we may from time to time, request an increase in the Credit Facility by an amount not exceeding $50 million. For our line of credit the weighted-average interest rate was 3.4% and 2.2% at October 31, 2018 and 2017. Under this credit facility, we had $15.0 million and $20.0 million outstanding as of October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThis Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for agreements of this type, including the following financial covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis: (a) a quarterly consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 and (b) a quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all such covenants at October 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations pursuant to which we are required to make cash payments. The information is presented as of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018:\n\nThe California avocado industry is subject to a state marketing order whereby handlers are required to collect assessments from the growers and remit such assessments to the California Avocado Commission (CAC). The assessments are primarily for advertising and promotions. The amount of the assessment is based on the dollars paid to the growers for their fruit, and, as a result, is not determinable until the value of the payments to the growers has been calculated.\nAmounts remitted to the Hass Avocado Board (HAB) in connection with their assessment program are likewise not determinable until the fruit is actually delivered to us. HAB assessments are primarily used to fund marketing and promotion efforts.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The guidance clarifies that modification accounting will be applied if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award changes. The Company adopted this new standard at the beginning of fiscal 2018. The adoption of the amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The FASB is issuing this update to simplify the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. We are evaluating the impact of the update of this ASU on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and, as such, we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the \"Act\"). In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. This ASU is effective for us the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and, as such, we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which adds guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this ASU to have an impact until an applicable transaction takes place.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which will require companies to recognize the income tax effects of intra-entity sales and transfers of assets other than inventory, particularly those asset transfers involving intellectual property, in the period in which the transfer occurs. The ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2019 fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact upon adoption.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. The ASU permits an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2021 fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Leases, which requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would\nrecognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity's leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. This ASU will be effective for us beginning the first day of our 2020 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Although we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements, we currently expect the most significant changes will be related to the recognition of material new long-term right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim period within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated statements of income depends on the net unrealized gain or loss on our equity investment. For the year ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, the net unrealized gain on our equity investment was $2.2 million and $6.3 million which relates solely to our investment in Limoneira.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard is intended to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition. During fiscal 2017, the FASB issued additional clarification guidance on the new revenue recognition standard which also included certain scope improvements and practical expedients. The standard (including clarification guidance issued) is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be our first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective transition method, under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the first day of our 2019 fiscal year. This standard will not have material impact on our results of operations or financial position.", "item_7_tables": "Table 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
