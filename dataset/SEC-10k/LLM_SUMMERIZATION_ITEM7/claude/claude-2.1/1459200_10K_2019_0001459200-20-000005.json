MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nAlarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 100 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.\nOur solutions are delivered through an established network of over 9,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. Our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, gateway modules and smart thermostats. We believe that the length of our service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust platforms and approximately 20 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.\nOur technology platforms are designed to make connected properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our solutions are used in both smart residential and commercial properties, which we refer to as the connected property market and we have designed our technology platforms for all market participants. This includes not only the residential and commercial property owners who subscribe to our services, but also the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who install and maintain our solutions.\nOur service provider partners can deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers. Our technology enables subscribers to seamlessly connect to their property through our family of mobile apps, websites, and new engagement platforms like voice control through Amazon Echo and Google Home, wearable devices like the Apple Watch, and TV platforms such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV.\nExecutive Overview and Highlights of 2019 and 2018 Results\nWe primarily generate SaaS and license revenue, our largest source of revenue, through our service provider partners who resell our services and pay us monthly fees. Our service provider partners sell, install and support Alarm.com solutions that enable residential and commercial property owners to intelligently secure, connect, control and automate their properties. Our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential or commercial property owners. Our subscribers consist of all of the properties maintained by those residential and commercial property owners to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. We derive a portion of our revenue from licensing our intellectual property to third parties on a per customer basis. SaaS and license revenue represented 67%, 69% and 70% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our non-hosted software platform, or Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Software license revenue represented 9%, 10% and 9% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe also generate revenue from the sale of hardware, including video cameras, video recorders, cellular radio modules, thermostats, image sensors and other peripherals, that enables our solutions. We have a rich history of innovation in cellular technology that enables our robust SaaS offering. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Hardware and other revenue represented 33%, 31% and 30% of\nour revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We typically expect hardware and other revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nHighlights of our financial performance for the periods covered in this Annual Report include:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SaaS and license revenue increased 16% to $337.4 million in 2019 from $291.1 million in 2018.

Our products are currently localized and available in approximately 40 countries outside of North America.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of PC Open Incorporated, a Washington corporation, doing business as OpenEye. OpenEye provides cloud-managed video surveillance solutions for the enterprise commercial market. We believe the acquisition of OpenEye will provide a key element to our comprehensive suite of interactive cloud-based services spanning video, access control, intrusion and automation for domestic and international commercial enterprises.\nIn consideration for the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye, we paid $61.2 million in cash on October 21, 2019, after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million is payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets are met. The purchase price allocation, which is pending until the final determination of the working capital and tax adjustments, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Business Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the way similar business metrics used by other companies are calculated and include the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS and license revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>108,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS and license revenue renewal rate\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSaaS and License Revenue\nWe believe that SaaS and license revenue is an indicator of the productivity of our existing service provider partners and their ability to activate and maintain subscribers using our intelligently connected property solutions, our ability to add new service provider partners reselling our solutions, the demand for our intelligently connected property solutions and the pace at which the market for these solutions is growing.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related adjustments and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures in this section for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nSaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate\nWe measure our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on a trailing 12-month basis by dividing (a) the total SaaS and license revenue recognized during the trailing 12-month period from our subscribers on our Alarm.com platform who were subscribers on the first day of the period, by (b) total SaaS and license revenue we would have recognized during the period from those same subscribers assuming no terminations, or service level upgrades or downgrades. The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage. Our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe that our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the lifetime value of our subscriber base.\nLeases (Topic 842)\nOn February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d or Topic 842, which requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use, or ROU, assets on the balance sheet. The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the update to allow entities to apply the transition requirements of Topic 842 at the adoption date rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Accordingly, the amendments in Topic 842 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 by applying the modified retrospective approach to all of our leases in effect as of that date. We used the optional transition method, which required us to record the initial effect of Topic 842 as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019. Additionally, we elected to use the package of practical expedients for the adoption of Topic 842, which allowed us not to reassess: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) whether initial direct costs for any existing leases qualify for capitalization under Topic 842. We also used the hindsight practical expedient when determining the lease term and assessing impairment of ROU assets.\nThe adoption of Topic 842 resulted in the recording of the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet Caption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of January 1, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease right-of-use assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities (current)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities (noncurrent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated deficit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe adoption of Topic 842 did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of equity and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOur fiscal year ends on December 31. The key elements of our operating results include:\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners' customers.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized.\nWe offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. In addition, in certain markets our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility's or market's control.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Hardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, and manufacturing facilities and factories across China. We anticipate there could be some disruption to our hardware supply chain due to the impact of the coronavirus on manufacturing and production in China. However, as the potential impact on global supply chains from the coronavirus is difficult to predict, the extent to which the coronavirus may negatively affect our hardware revenue is uncertain.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras and video recorders, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Our cost of hardware and other revenue also includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.\nWe record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nIn 2019, the U.S. administration has called for significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Beginning in May 2019, certain of our video camera products became subject to a 25% import duty. Additionally, beginning in September 2019, certain of our video cameras and sensors became subject to a 15% import duty. Approximately one-third to one-half of the finished goods hardware products that we sell to our service provider partners are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. We continue to monitor the changes in tariffs. If tariffs are increased or are expanded to apply to more of our products, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and amortization and depreciation expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories, excluding amortization and depreciation. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options and other forms of equity compensation in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient's function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development). We grew from 884 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 1,160 employees as of December 31, 2019, and we expect to continue to hire new employees to support the projected future growth of our business.\nSales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, travel, and commissions. Our sales and marketing teams engage in sales, account management, service provider partner support, advertising, promotion of our products and services and marketing.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions increased from 288 as of January 1, 2019 to 391 as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to expand our business both domestically and internationally and, as a result, expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis. We intend to increase the size of our sales force and our service provider partner support team to provide additional support to our existing service provider partner base to drive their productivity in selling our solutions as well as to enroll new service provider partners in North America and in international markets.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Additional expenses included in this category are legal costs, including those that are incurred to defend and license our intellectual property, as well as non-personnel costs, such as travel related expenses, rent, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and insurance expenses. Also included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition-related expenses, which consist primarily of legal, accounting and professional service fees directly related to acquisitions, valuation gains or losses on acquisition-related contingent liabilities.\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 96 as of January 1, 2019 to 148 as of December 31, 2019. Excluding intellectual property litigation and acquisition-related costs, we expect general and administrative costs to increase prospectively as our business grows. This includes cost increases related to accounting, finance, and legal personnel, additional external legal, audit fees and other expenses associated with regulations governing public companies. While somewhat unpredictable, we also expect to continue to incur costs related to litigation involving intellectual property. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding litigation matters.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 500 as of January 1, 2019 to 621 as of December 31, 2019. Our research and development efforts are focused on innovating new features and enhancing the functionality of our platforms and the solutions we offer to our service provider partners and subscribers. We will also continue to invest in efforts to extend our platforms to adjacent markets and internationally. We expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue in the short term to maintain our leadership position in the development of intelligently connected property technology, and continued enhancement of our Enterprise Tools platform for our service provider partners.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation consists of amortization of intangible assets originating from our acquisitions as well as our internally-developed capitalized software. Our depreciation expense is related to investments in property and equipment. Acquired intangible assets include developed technology, customer related intangibles, trademarks and trade names. We expect in the near term that amortization and depreciation may fluctuate based on our acquisition activity, development of our platforms and capitalized expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with our credit facilities. On October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The 2017 Facility is available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes, as permitted under the terms of the 2017 Facility. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and our notes receivable.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gains earned on our notes receivable and conversion of our outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment, partially offset by an impairment of one of our investments.\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This legislation made significant changes in U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Our effective tax rates were different from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based payment transactions, foreign derived intangible income deductions and research and development tax credits claimed, and state taxes, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible meal and entertainment expenses and state taxes. We recognize excess tax windfall benefits on a discrete basis in the quarter in which it occurs, and we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price and exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans each period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented (in thousands). Certain previously reported amounts in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation to reflect interest income as a separate line item, which was previously included in other income, net.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

revenue has increased sequentially for all periods presented due to growth in our subscriber base driven by the effectiveness of our service provider partners' ability to resell our services and due to service providers and their subscribers on our Software platform. Hardware and other revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on the timing of hardware orders from our service providers and hardware distributors.\nThe cost of revenue, in absolute dollars, has increased over time corresponding to the increase in revenue. The cost of revenue as a percent of revenue is lower in quarters when SaaS and license revenue represents a greater percentage of total revenue. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue has been between 14% and 16% for all periods presented.\nOperating expenses have generally increased over time. Our most significant operating expenses are employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Research and development personnel have attributed to approximately 46% of our headcount increase over the eight quarters presented. We continue to invest in research and development to enhance our SaaS solution capabilities for both our residential and commercial subscribers and to enhance our suite of enterprise tools that enable our service provider partners to expand their business. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $28.0 million expense related to an agreement reached in 2018 to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded interest of $1.7 million within interest income and recorded a $6.9 million gain within other income, net, which relates to promissory note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and proceeds from an acquired promissory note.\nSegment Information\nWe have two reportable segments: Alarm.com and Other. Our Alarm.com segment represents our cloud-based and Software platforms for the intelligently connected property and related solutions that contributed 93%, 93% and 94% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our Other segment is focused on researching, developing and offering residential and commercial automation solutions and energy management products and services in adjacent markets. The consolidated subsidiaries that make up our Other segment are in the investment stage and have incurred significant operating expenses relative to their revenue.\nOur Alarm.com segment increased from 803 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 1,076 employees as of December 31, 2019. Our Other segment increased from 81 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 84 employees as of December 31, 2019. Inter-segment revenue includes sales of hardware between our segments.\nThe following table presents our revenue, inter-segment revenue and operating expenses by segment (in thousands):\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>SaaS and License Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hardware and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SaaS and License Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hardware and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SaaS and License Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hardware and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alarm.com\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>19,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment Alarm.com\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,366\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment included software license revenue of $43.4 million, $41.3 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was no software license revenue recorded for the Other segment during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, costs and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners' customers.\nTo determine the transaction price, we analyze all of the performance obligations included in the contract. We consider the terms of the contract and our customary business practices, which typically do not include financing components or non-cash consideration. We have variable consideration in the form of retrospective volume discounts, rebate incentives, restocking fees and assurance-type warranties. The significant inputs related to variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and the historical and expected number of returns. Depending on the type of variable consideration and its predictability, we may apply an expected value\u201d approach or a most likely amount\u201d approach. We estimate the variable consideration at the onset of a contract and include the variable consideration within the transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of the variable consideration would not occur in the future. When determining whether the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price should be constrained, we look at the history of hardware purchased and subscribers added by our service provider partners to estimate the likelihood of those service provider partners obtaining the retrospective volume discounts and rebates. At times, our contracts include consideration payable to a customer in the form of fixed discounts or rebates. We record the consideration payable to a customer as a reduction to the transaction price resulting in a reduction to revenue over the service period.\nIf we enter into contracts that contain multiple promised services, we evaluate which of the promised services represent separate performance obligations based on whether or not the promised services are distinct and whether or not the services are separable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are met, then we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price method at contract inception.\nIn determining the relative estimated selling prices, we consider market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. Any discount within the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract unless the terms of discount relate specifically to the entity's efforts to satisfy some but not all of the performance obligations.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. We also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. We recognize revenue from SaaS services on a monthly basis as we satisfy our performance obligations.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. Under the usage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors and peripherals. We recognize hardware and other revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations, which primarily occurs when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor, net of a reserve for estimated returns.\nWhen determining the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to for the sale of our hardware, we estimate the variable consideration associated with customer returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our reserve against revenue for hardware returns was 1%, 2% and 2% of hardware and other revenue, respectively. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Historically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve. Additionally, we provide assurance-type warranties related to the intended functionality of the products and services provided and those warranties typically allow for the return of hardware up to one year past the date of sale. These warranties were not identified as separate performance obligations.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property that is functional in nature and has significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional intellectual property, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs once the software has been made available to the customer.\nHardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee. We record activation fees initially as deferred revenue and we recognize these fees ratably over the expected term of the subscribers' account which we estimate is ten years based on our annual attrition rate.\nWe do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to recognize revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our SaaS and license revenue as well as our hardware and other revenue.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity.\nThe liability for the subsidiary unit awards relates to agreements established with employees of our subsidiaries for cash awards contingent upon the subsidiary companies meeting certain financial milestones such as revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin and was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs. We account for these subsidiary awards using fair value and establish liabilities for the future payment for the repurchase of subsidiary units under the terms of the agreements based on estimating revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin of the subsidiary units over the periods of the awards through the anticipated repurchase dates. We estimated the fair value of each liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The fair value of each liability is calculated with thousands of projected outcomes, the results of which are averaged and then discounted to estimate the present value. At each reporting date until the respective payment dates, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach based on the applicable subsidiary's revenue and future collection of financed customer receivables, the unobservable inputs, and we will record any changes in the employee's compensation expense. Some of the awards are subject to the employees' continued employment and therefore recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. The liability for the subsidiary unit awards was $0.2 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe liability for the contingent consideration consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and has a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and establish a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. The liability for the contingent consideration was $2.6 million as of December 31, 2019.\nBased on these assessments of fair value, we remeasured the liabilities valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs and recorded a reduction of $0.2 million in operating expenses within the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the subsidiary unit awards or the contingent consideration. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the subsidiary unit awards or the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, we may be exposed to additional operating expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe compensate our executive officers, board of directors, employees and consultants with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense based upon the award's grant date fair value and use an accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to estimate the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be\noutstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options.\nWe do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our stock-based compensation expense.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in valuing intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, discount rates, attrition rates related to acquired customer relationships, royalty rates and obsolescence factors related to acquired developed technology and royalty rates relate to acquired trade names.\nDuring the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nSome acquisitions may include contingent consideration, which is an obligation to make future payments to the seller contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets. We estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing contingent consideration include estimates about future financial results, revenue volatility and the discount rate. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination, over (2) the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization. The amount of goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nFor our 2019 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2019. Our assessment was performed as of October 1, 2019, and we have determined there have been no triggering events from our assessment date through December 31, 2019.\nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we determined there were no indicators of impairment of our intangible assets with definite lives or long-lived assets.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification, or ASC 740, \"Income Taxes,\" which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Due to the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets related to our Canadian net operating losses and research and development tax credits, we established a valuation allowance of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2019, which remained at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, based on our historical and expected future taxable earnings, we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize all of the benefit of the existing deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we did not record a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties as a component of our income tax provision.\nImpairment of Notes Receivable\nNotes receivable are presented net of an allowance for uncollectibility, if any. We accrue interest on notes receivable based on the contractual terms of the note. Outstanding notes receivable that are aged 30 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. Notes receivable are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. We periodically assess our notes receivable for collectibility and impairment by considering internal factors such as payment status, collateral value, the probability of collecting payments when due and credit quality as well as external factors such as economic conditions. We do not accrue interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are greater than 90 days past due based on their contractual payment terms. Notes receivable may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management's opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a note receivable has been placed in nonaccrual status, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A note receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer's delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured.\nBased on our assessment of the collectibility of a promissory note provided to one of our hardware suppliers, we recorded an impairment of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was subsequently reversed during the year ended December 31, 2019 upon receiving a payment from our hardware supplier. If changes in the assumptions used to assess the collectibility and impairment of our notes receivable occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and working capital, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>76,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>167,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 are available for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes, and our investment policy is to invest any excess cash in short term, highly liquid investments that limit the risk of principal loss; therefore, our cash and cash equivalents are held in demand deposit accounts that generate very low returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $119.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. To date, we have principally financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and, to a lesser extent, through private and public equity financings.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our 2017 Facility, and our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be approximately $18.0 million, primarily related to the continued build out of our leased and owned office space, as well as purchases of computer software and equipment. In February 2020, we made a prepayment of $4.7 million for long lead-time parts related to our inventory. On August 30, 2018, we reached an agreement in principle to settle a putative class action lawsuit filed against us and Alarm.com Incorporated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The tentative settlement was subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement and Court approval. On October 25, 2018, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement, or the Settlement Agreement, with the plaintiffs. An initial payment of $5.0 million was made by us to the settlement administrator on January 2, 2019 and the remaining payment of $23.0 million was made on September 30, 2019.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a subordinate convertible promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers, or the October 2018 Promissory Note, which was amended in November 2018, January 2019 and February 2019 as a result of the hardware supplier's financial restructuring. In March 2019, we entered into a separate secured promissory note with the same hardware supplier, which, together with the October 2018 Promissory Note, we refer to as the Promissory Notes. Under the Promissory Notes, we agreed to provide the hardware supplier loans of up to $7.4 million, collateralized by all assets owned by the supplier. In March 2019, we paid $16.4 million to acquire a secured promissory note, or the Acquired Promissory Note, that was originally executed between our hardware supplier and another third-party secured creditor. The Acquired Promissory Note had an outstanding balance of $26.6 million as of December 31, 2018, including interest. In addition to the $16.4 million paid in March 2019 for the Acquired Promissory Note, we agreed to pay the third-party secured creditor an additional $6.0 million, subject to certain contingencies measured as of May 4, 2019. Based on the outcome of those contingencies, we recorded a $6.0 million liability in March 2019 related to the Acquired Promissory Note and paid the $6.0 million contingent liability during the three months ended September 30, 2019.\nOn May 6, 2019, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the hardware supplier, or the Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement, the hardware supplier agreed to pay us the outstanding balance of principal and interest under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note before June 30, 2019. In consideration for the full and timely payments under the Forbearance Agreement, we agreed to temporarily forbear from exercising the remedies available to us with respect to the collateral securing the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On June 24, 2019, we entered into a Forbearance Extension Agreement with the hardware supplier, under which the hardware supplier agreed to pay us $7.4 million on or before June 24, 2019. In consideration for the $7.4 million payment under the Forbearance Extension Agreement, we\nagreed to temporarily forbear from exercising the remedies available to us with respect to the collateral securing the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note until July 10, 2019.\nOn June 24, 2019, we received a payment of $7.4 million from the hardware supplier for the partial satisfaction of amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On July 15, 2019, we received an additional payment of $25.0 million from the supplier and converted the remaining outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment in the hardware supplier.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was no remaining outstanding balance on the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Promissory Notes excluding interest was $3.3 million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets prior to any adjustments for impairment.\nOn September 18, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of in-process research and development, or IPR&D. In consideration for the purchase of the IPR&D, we paid $0.9 million in cash on September 18, 2019, with the remaining $0.1 million expected to be paid 18 months following the acquisition date, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations.\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye for $61.2 million in cash after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. The working capital adjustment is expected to be finalized and paid to the stockholders of OpenEye in the first half of 2020 along with a portion of the holdback. The remaining amount of the holdback is expected to be paid to the stockholders of OpenEye by the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million is payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets are met. We recorded a redeemable noncontrolling interest of $11.4 million on October 21, 2019 related to the remaining 15% equity interest owned by the minority OpenEye stockholders. The purchase price allocation, which is pending until the final determination of the working capital and tax adjustments, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2019, we purchased land and a commercial building located in Liberty Lake, Washington for $5.1 million. Once renovations are complete, this building will be used by OpenEye for sales and training, research and development, warehousing and administrative purposes.\nOur future working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in human resources and capital equipment, future acquisitions and investments, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new solutions and platform and solution enhancements. To the extent our cash and cash equivalents, together with our 2017 Facility, and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to borrow additional funds through our bank credit arrangements or raise funds from public or private equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would likely have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur 2017 Facility is a revolving credit facility with SVB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders to finance working capital and certain permitted acquisitions and investments. The 2017 Facility is available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes including acquisitions, and has a current borrowing capacity of $125.0 million. We have the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the 2017 Facility to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $63.0 million was outstanding under the 2017 Facility, no letters of credit were outstanding and $62.0 million remained available for borrowing under the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, and limit our capacity to incur other indebtedness, liens, make certain payments including dividends, and enter into other transactions without approval of the lenders. The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2017 Facility. Our outstanding amounts under the 2017 Facility are due at maturity in October 2022. The 2017 Facility is discussed in more detail below under \"Debt Obligations.\"\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay dividends during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. We cannot provide any assurance that we will declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by restrictions\nunder the terms of the agreements governing the 2017 Facility. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(73,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168,795\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) / from financing activities\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable and inventory, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation.\nFor 2019, cash flows from operating activities were $47.1 million, compared to $60.7 million for 2018. This $13.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $31.8 million increase in net income and a $16.0 million increase in non-cash items.\nThe $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, and such settlement amount was subsequently paid during 2019. The decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was also due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements. The $16.0 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.1 million change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. Additionally, the increase in non-cash items was due to a $7.2 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2019, partially offset by a gain of $6.9 million recorded during 2019 related to the proceeds from the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note received from one of our hardware suppliers.\nFor 2018, cash flows from operating activities were $60.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million from 2017, as the result of a $13.5 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities partially offset by a $7.7 million decrease in net income and a $2.3 million decrease in non-cash items.\nThe $13.5 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, which was not paid as of December 31, 2018. This increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in the change in inventory related to the purchase of long lead-time parts, a $2.8 million settlement of the liability related to the subsidiary unit awards during 2018 and differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements.\nThe $2.3 million decrease in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in the change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. This decrease in non-cash items was partially offset by a $6.0 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2018. Additionally, there was a $4.0 million increase in amortization and depreciation primarily due to the additional amortization of customer relationships, developed technology and trade name intangibles acquired from the Acquisition in the first quarter of 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities typically include acquisitions, capital expenditures, notes receivable issued to companies with offerings complementary to ours and proceeds from the repayment of those notes receivable. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business use, including leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount, computer equipment used internally, and expansion of our network operations centers.\nFor 2019, our cash flows used in investing activities was $73.4 million as compared to $13.4 million in 2018. The $60.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $58.8 million, net of cash acquired, for 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. The increase in cash used in investing activities was also due to $22.4 million paid in 2019 for the Acquired Promissory Note, $3.7 million of additional funding provided to the hardware supplier under the Promissory Notes in 2019 and $5.1 million paid for the purchase of land and a commercial building in 2019. The increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by $30.7 million received from one of our hardware suppliers for the amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note.\nFor 2018, our cash flows used in investing activities was $13.4 million as compared to $168.8 million in 2017. The $155.4 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $154.3 million, net of cash acquired, for our acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities typically includes repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt.\nFor 2019, cash flows used in financing activities was $0.1 million compared to cash flows from financing activities of $2.4 million in 2018. The $2.5 million change in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $2.5 million in the issuance of common stock under equity-based plans.\nFor 2018, cash flows from financing activities was $2.4 million compared to $67.3 million in 2017. The $64.9 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the $64.3 million of net proceeds borrowed under the credit facilities during 2017 related to the Acquisition in March 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is information about our material contractual obligations and the periods in which those future payments are due as of December 31, 2019. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates. As of December 31, 2019, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused line fee payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subsidiary unit award liabilities2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The 2017 Facility incurs interest at a variable rate.

The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit under our 2017 Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nDebt Obligations\nOn October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Upon entry into the 2017 Facility, we borrowed $72.0 million, which was used to repay the previously outstanding balance under our previous credit facility. The 2017 Facility matures in October 2022 and includes an option to further increase the borrowing capacity to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders. Costs incurred in connection with the 2017 Facility were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. During each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we repaid $4.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2017 Facility.\nThe outstanding principal balance on the 2017 Facility accrues interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we elected for the outstanding principal balance to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, LIBOR plus 1.75%, LIBOR plus 2.00%, and LIBOR plus 2.50% when our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 1.00:1.00 but less than 2.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00 but less than 3.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, respectively. The 2017 Facility also carries an unused line commitment fee of 0.20%. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the effective interest rate on the credit facilities was 4.45%, 4.13% and 4.16%, respectively.\nThe carrying value of the 2017 Facility was $63.0 million and $67.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2017 Facility includes a variable interest rate that approximates market rates and, as such, we classified the liability as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and determined that the carrying amount of the 2017 Facility approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.00 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants and there were no events of default. The 2017 Facility also contains customary conditions to borrowings and events of default and contains various negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur encumbrances, make certain payments including dividends, make investments or engage in transactions with affiliates without approval of the lenders.\nOn November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that must be met for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly,\nwe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, interest income and other income, net\n</td> <td>(8,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for / (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>5,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,825\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization and depreciation expense\n</td> <td>22,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>20,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expense\n</td> <td>2,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation expense\n</td> <td>12,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjustments\n</td> <td>54,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Software license revenue represented 9%, 10% and 9% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe also generate revenue from the sale of hardware, including video cameras, video recorders, cellular radio modules, thermostats, image sensors and other peripherals, that enables our solutions. We have a rich history of innovation in cellular technology that enables our robust SaaS offering. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Hardware and other revenue represented 33%, 31% and 30% of\nour revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We typically expect hardware and other revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nHighlights of our financial performance for the periods covered in this Annual Report include:\n \u2022 SaaS and license revenue increased 16% to $337.4 million in 2019 from $291.1 million in 2018. SaaS and license revenue increased 23% to $291.1 million in 2018 from $236.3 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Total revenue increased 19% to $502.4 million in 2019 from $420.5 million in 2018. Total revenue increased 24% to $420.5 million in 2018 from $338.9 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Net income attributable to common stockholders was $53.5 million in 2019, $21.5 million in 2018 and $29.2 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance, increased to $108.3 million in 2019 from $93.1 million in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $93.1 million in 2018 from $71.6 million in 2017. \nPlease see Non-GAAP Measures below in this section of this Annual Report for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nGeographic Areas\nWe believe there is significant opportunity to expand our international business, as 3% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 originated from customers located outside of North America. Our products are currently localized and available in approximately 40 countries outside of North America.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of PC Open Incorporated, a Washington corporation, doing business as OpenEye. OpenEye provides cloud-managed video surveillance solutions for the enterprise commercial market. We believe the acquisition of OpenEye will provide a key element to our comprehensive suite of interactive cloud-based services spanning video, access control, intrusion and automation for domestic and international commercial enterprises.\nIn consideration for the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye, we paid $61.2 million in cash on October 21, 2019, after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million is payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets are met. The purchase price allocation, which is pending until the final determination of the working capital and tax adjustments, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Business Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the way similar business metrics used by other companies are calculated and include the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS and license revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>108,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS and license revenue renewal rate\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSaaS and License Revenue\nWe believe that SaaS and license revenue is an indicator of the productivity of our existing service provider partners and their ability to activate and maintain subscribers using our intelligently connected property solutions, our ability to add new service provider partners reselling our solutions, the demand for our intelligently connected property solutions and the pace at which the market for these solutions is growing.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related adjustments and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures in this section for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nSaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate\nWe measure our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on a trailing 12-month basis by dividing (a) the total SaaS and license revenue recognized during the trailing 12-month period from our subscribers on our Alarm.com platform who were subscribers on the first day of the period, by (b) total SaaS and license revenue we would have recognized during the period from those same subscribers assuming no terminations, or service level upgrades or downgrades. The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage. Our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe that our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the lifetime value of our subscriber base.\nLeases (Topic 842)\nOn February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d or Topic 842, which requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use, or ROU, assets on the balance sheet. The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the update to allow entities to apply the transition requirements of Topic 842 at the adoption date rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Accordingly, the amendments in Topic 842 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 by applying the modified retrospective approach to all of our leases in effect as of that date. We used the optional transition method, which required us to record the initial effect of Topic 842 as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019. Additionally, we elected to use the package of practical expedients for the adoption of Topic 842, which allowed us not to reassess: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) whether initial direct costs for any existing leases qualify for capitalization under Topic 842. We also used the hindsight practical expedient when determining the lease term and assessing impairment of ROU assets.\nThe adoption of Topic 842 resulted in the recording of the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet Caption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of January 1, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease right-of-use assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities (current)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities (noncurrent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated deficit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe adoption of Topic 842 did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of equity and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOur fiscal year ends on December 31. The key elements of our operating results include:\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners' customers.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized.\nWe offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. In addition, in certain markets our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility's or market's control.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Hardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, and manufacturing facilities and factories across China. We anticipate there could be some disruption to our hardware supply chain due to the impact of the coronavirus on manufacturing and production in China. However, as the potential impact on global supply chains from the coronavirus is difficult to predict, the extent to which the coronavirus may negatively affect our hardware revenue is uncertain.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras and video recorders, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Our cost of hardware and other revenue also includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.\nWe record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nIn 2019, the U.S. administration has called for significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Beginning in May 2019, certain of our video camera products became subject to a 25% import duty. Additionally, beginning in September 2019, certain of our video cameras and sensors became subject to a 15% import duty. Approximately one-third to one-half of the finished goods hardware products that we sell to our service provider partners are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. We continue to monitor the changes in tariffs. If tariffs are increased or are expanded to apply to more of our products, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and amortization and depreciation expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories, excluding amortization and depreciation. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options and other forms of equity compensation in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient's function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development). We grew from 884 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 1,160 employees as of December 31, 2019, and we expect to continue to hire new employees to support the projected future growth of our business.\nSales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, travel, and commissions. Our sales and marketing teams engage in sales, account management, service provider partner support, advertising, promotion of our products and services and marketing.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions increased from 288 as of January 1, 2019 to 391 as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to expand our business both domestically and internationally and, as a result, expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis. We intend to increase the size of our sales force and our service provider partner support team to provide additional support to our existing service provider partner base to drive their productivity in selling our solutions as well as to enroll new service provider partners in North America and in international markets.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Additional expenses included in this category are legal costs, including those that are incurred to defend and license our intellectual property, as well as non-personnel costs, such as travel related expenses, rent, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and insurance expenses. Also included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition-related expenses, which consist primarily of legal, accounting and professional service fees directly related to acquisitions, valuation gains or losses on acquisition-related contingent liabilities.\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 96 as of January 1, 2019 to 148 as of December 31, 2019. Excluding intellectual property litigation and acquisition-related costs, we expect general and administrative costs to increase prospectively as our business grows. This includes cost increases related to accounting, finance, and legal personnel, additional external legal, audit fees and other expenses associated with regulations governing public companies. While somewhat unpredictable, we also expect to continue to incur costs related to litigation involving intellectual property. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding litigation matters.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 500 as of January 1, 2019 to 621 as of December 31, 2019. Our research and development efforts are focused on innovating new features and enhancing the functionality of our platforms and the solutions we offer to our service provider partners and subscribers. We will also continue to invest in efforts to extend our platforms to adjacent markets and internationally. We expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue in the short term to maintain our leadership position in the development of intelligently connected property technology, and continued enhancement of our Enterprise Tools platform for our service provider partners.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation consists of amortization of intangible assets originating from our acquisitions as well as our internally-developed capitalized software. Our depreciation expense is related to investments in property and equipment. Acquired intangible assets include developed technology, customer related intangibles, trademarks and trade names. We expect in the near term that amortization and depreciation may fluctuate based on our acquisition activity, development of our platforms and capitalized expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with our credit facilities. On October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The 2017 Facility is available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes, as permitted under the terms of the 2017 Facility. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and our notes receivable.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gains earned on our notes receivable and conversion of our outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment, partially offset by an impairment of one of our investments.\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This legislation made significant changes in U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Our effective tax rates were different from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based payment transactions, foreign derived intangible income deductions and research and development tax credits claimed, and state taxes, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible meal and entertainment expenses and state taxes. We recognize excess tax windfall benefits on a discrete basis in the quarter in which it occurs, and we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price and exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans each period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented (in thousands). Certain previously reported amounts in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation to reflect interest income as a separate line item, which was previously included in other income, net.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

revenue has increased sequentially for all periods presented due to growth in our subscriber base driven by the effectiveness of our service provider partners' ability to resell our services and due to service providers and their subscribers on our Software platform. Hardware and other revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on the timing of hardware orders from our service providers and hardware distributors.\nThe cost of revenue, in absolute dollars, has increased over time corresponding to the increase in revenue. The cost of revenue as a percent of revenue is lower in quarters when SaaS and license revenue represents a greater percentage of total revenue. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue has been between 14% and 16% for all periods presented.\nOperating expenses have generally increased over time. Our most significant operating expenses are employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Research and development personnel have attributed to approximately 46% of our headcount increase over the eight quarters presented. We continue to invest in research and development to enhance our SaaS solution capabilities for both our residential and commercial subscribers and to enhance our suite of enterprise tools that enable our service provider partners to expand their business. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $28.0 million expense related to an agreement reached in 2018 to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded interest of $1.7 million within interest income and recorded a $6.9 million gain within other income, net, which relates to promissory note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and proceeds from an acquired promissory note.\nSegment Information\nWe have two reportable segments: Alarm.com and Other. Our Alarm.com segment represents our cloud-based and Software platforms for the intelligently connected property and related solutions that contributed 93%, 93% and 94% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our Other segment is focused on researching, developing and offering residential and commercial automation solutions and energy management products and services in adjacent markets. The consolidated subsidiaries that make up our Other segment are in the investment stage and have incurred significant operating expenses relative to their revenue.\nOur Alarm.com segment increased from 803 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 1,076 employees as of December 31, 2019. Our Other segment increased from 81 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 84 employees as of December 31, 2019. Inter-segment revenue includes sales of hardware between our segments.\nThe following table presents our revenue, inter-segment revenue and operating expenses by segment (in thousands):\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>SaaS and License Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hardware and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SaaS and License Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hardware and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SaaS and License Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hardware and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alarm.com\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>19,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment Alarm.com\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,749\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,366\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment included software license revenue of $43.4 million, $41.3 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, costs and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners' customers.\nTo determine the transaction price, we analyze all of the performance obligations included in the contract. We consider the terms of the contract and our customary business practices, which typically do not include financing components or non-cash consideration. We have variable consideration in the form of retrospective volume discounts, rebate incentives, restocking fees and assurance-type warranties. The significant inputs related to variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and the historical and expected number of returns. Depending on the type of variable consideration and its predictability, we may apply an expected value\u201d approach or a most likely amount\u201d approach. We estimate the variable consideration at the onset of a contract and include the variable consideration within the transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of the variable consideration would not occur in the future. When determining whether the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price should be constrained, we look at the history of hardware purchased and subscribers added by our service provider partners to estimate the likelihood of those service provider partners obtaining the retrospective volume discounts and rebates. At times, our contracts include consideration payable to a customer in the form of fixed discounts or rebates. We record the consideration payable to a customer as a reduction to the transaction price resulting in a reduction to revenue over the service period.\nIf we enter into contracts that contain multiple promised services, we evaluate which of the promised services represent separate performance obligations based on whether or not the promised services are distinct and whether or not the services are separable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are met, then we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price method at contract inception.\nIn determining the relative estimated selling prices, we consider market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. Any discount within the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract unless the terms of discount relate specifically to the entity's efforts to satisfy some but not all of the performance obligations.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. We also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. We recognize revenue from SaaS services on a monthly basis as we satisfy our performance obligations.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. Under the usage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors and peripherals. We recognize hardware and other revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations, which primarily occurs when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor, net of a reserve for estimated returns.\nWhen determining the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to for the sale of our hardware, we estimate the variable consideration associated with customer returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our reserve against revenue for hardware returns was 1%, 2% and 2% of hardware and other revenue, respectively. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Historically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve. Additionally, we provide assurance-type warranties related to the intended functionality of the products and services provided and those warranties typically allow for the return of hardware up to one year past the date of sale. These warranties were not identified as separate performance obligations.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property that is functional in nature and has significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional intellectual property, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs once the software has been made available to the customer.\nHardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee. We record activation fees initially as deferred revenue and we recognize these fees ratably over the expected term of the subscribers' account which we estimate is ten years based on our annual attrition rate.\nWe do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to recognize revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our SaaS and license revenue as well as our hardware and other revenue.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity.\nThe liability for the subsidiary unit awards relates to agreements established with employees of our subsidiaries for cash awards contingent upon the subsidiary companies meeting certain financial milestones such as revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin and was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs. We account for these subsidiary awards using fair value and establish liabilities for the future payment for the repurchase of subsidiary units under the terms of the agreements based on estimating revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin of the subsidiary units over the periods of the awards through the anticipated repurchase dates. We estimated the fair value of each liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The fair value of each liability is calculated with thousands of projected outcomes, the results of which are averaged and then discounted to estimate the present value. At each reporting date until the respective payment dates, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach based on the applicable subsidiary's revenue and future collection of financed customer receivables, the unobservable inputs, and we will record any changes in the employee's compensation expense. Some of the awards are subject to the employees' continued employment and therefore recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. The liability for the subsidiary unit awards was $0.2 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe liability for the contingent consideration consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and has a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and establish a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. The liability for the contingent consideration was $2.6 million as of December 31, 2019.\nBased on these assessments of fair value, we remeasured the liabilities valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs and recorded a reduction of $0.2 million in operating expenses within the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the subsidiary unit awards or the contingent consideration. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the subsidiary unit awards or the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, we may be exposed to additional operating expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe compensate our executive officers, board of directors, employees and consultants with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense based upon the award's grant date fair value and use an accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to estimate the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be\noutstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options.\nWe do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our stock-based compensation expense.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in valuing intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, discount rates, attrition rates related to acquired customer relationships, royalty rates and obsolescence factors related to acquired developed technology and royalty rates relate to acquired trade names.\nDuring the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nSome acquisitions may include contingent consideration, which is an obligation to make future payments to the seller contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets. We estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing contingent consideration include estimates about future financial results, revenue volatility and the discount rate. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination, over (2) the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization. The amount of goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nFor our 2019 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2019. Our assessment was performed as of October 1, 2019, and we have determined there have been no triggering events from our assessment date through December 31, 2019.\nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we determined there were no indicators of impairment of our intangible assets with definite lives or long-lived assets.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification, or ASC 740, \"Income Taxes,\" which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Due to the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets related to our Canadian net operating losses and research and development tax credits, we established a valuation allowance of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2019, which remained at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, based on our historical and expected future taxable earnings, we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize all of the benefit of the existing deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we did not record a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties as a component of our income tax provision.\nImpairment of Notes Receivable\nNotes receivable are presented net of an allowance for uncollectibility, if any. We accrue interest on notes receivable based on the contractual terms of the note. Outstanding notes receivable that are aged 30 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. Notes receivable are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. We periodically assess our notes receivable for collectibility and impairment by considering internal factors such as payment status, collateral value, the probability of collecting payments when due and credit quality as well as external factors such as economic conditions. We do not accrue interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are greater than 90 days past due based on their contractual payment terms. Notes receivable may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management's opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a note receivable has been placed in nonaccrual status, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A note receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer's delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured.\nBased on our assessment of the collectibility of a promissory note provided to one of our hardware suppliers, we recorded an impairment of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was subsequently reversed during the year ended December 31, 2019 upon receiving a payment from our hardware supplier. If changes in the assumptions used to assess the collectibility and impairment of our notes receivable occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and working capital, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>76,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>167,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 are available for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes, and our investment policy is to invest any excess cash in short term, highly liquid investments that limit the risk of principal loss; therefore, our cash and cash equivalents are held in demand deposit accounts that generate very low returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $119.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. To date, we have principally financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and, to a lesser extent, through private and public equity financings.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our 2017 Facility, and our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be approximately $18.0 million, primarily related to the continued build out of our leased and owned office space, as well as purchases of computer software and equipment. In February 2020, we made a prepayment of $4.7 million for long lead-time parts related to our inventory. On August 30, 2018, we reached an agreement in principle to settle a putative class action lawsuit filed against us and Alarm.com Incorporated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The tentative settlement was subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement and Court approval. On October 25, 2018, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement, or the Settlement Agreement, with the plaintiffs. An initial payment of $5.0 million was made by us to the settlement administrator on January 2, 2019 and the remaining payment of $23.0 million was made on September 30, 2019.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a subordinate convertible promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers, or the October 2018 Promissory Note, which was amended in November 2018, January 2019 and February 2019 as a result of the hardware supplier's financial restructuring. In March 2019, we entered into a separate secured promissory note with the same hardware supplier, which, together with the October 2018 Promissory Note, we refer to as the Promissory Notes. Under the Promissory Notes, we agreed to provide the hardware supplier loans of up to $7.4 million, collateralized by all assets owned by the supplier. In March 2019, we paid $16.4 million to acquire a secured promissory note, or the Acquired Promissory Note, that was originally executed between our hardware supplier and another third-party secured creditor. The Acquired Promissory Note had an outstanding balance of $26.6 million as of December 31, 2018, including interest. In addition to the $16.4 million paid in March 2019 for the Acquired Promissory Note, we agreed to pay the third-party secured creditor an additional $6.0 million, subject to certain contingencies measured as of May 4, 2019. Based on the outcome of those contingencies, we recorded a $6.0 million liability in March 2019 related to the Acquired Promissory Note and paid the $6.0 million contingent liability during the three months ended September 30, 2019.\nOn May 6, 2019, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the hardware supplier, or the Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement, the hardware supplier agreed to pay us the outstanding balance of principal and interest under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note before June 30, 2019. In consideration for the full and timely payments under the Forbearance Agreement, we agreed to temporarily forbear from exercising the remedies available to us with respect to the collateral securing the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On June 24, 2019, we entered into a Forbearance Extension Agreement with the hardware supplier, under which the hardware supplier agreed to pay us $7.4 million on or before June 24, 2019. In consideration for the $7.4 million payment under the Forbearance Extension Agreement, we\nagreed to temporarily forbear from exercising the remedies available to us with respect to the collateral securing the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note until July 10, 2019.\nOn June 24, 2019, we received a payment of $7.4 million from the hardware supplier for the partial satisfaction of amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On July 15, 2019, we received an additional payment of $25.0 million from the supplier and converted the remaining outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment in the hardware supplier.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was no remaining outstanding balance on the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Promissory Notes excluding interest was $3.3 million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets prior to any adjustments for impairment.\nOn September 18, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of in-process research and development, or IPR&D. In consideration for the purchase of the IPR&D, we paid $0.9 million in cash on September 18, 2019, with the remaining $0.1 million expected to be paid 18 months following the acquisition date, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations.\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye for $61.2 million in cash after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. The working capital adjustment is expected to be finalized and paid to the stockholders of OpenEye in the first half of 2020 along with a portion of the holdback. The remaining amount of the holdback is expected to be paid to the stockholders of OpenEye by the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million is payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets are met. We recorded a redeemable noncontrolling interest of $11.4 million on October 21, 2019 related to the remaining 15% equity interest owned by the minority OpenEye stockholders. The purchase price allocation, which is pending until the final determination of the working capital and tax adjustments, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2019, we purchased land and a commercial building located in Liberty Lake, Washington for $5.1 million. Once renovations are complete, this building will be used by OpenEye for sales and training, research and development, warehousing and administrative purposes.\nOur future working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in human resources and capital equipment, future acquisitions and investments, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new solutions and platform and solution enhancements. To the extent our cash and cash equivalents, together with our 2017 Facility, and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to borrow additional funds through our bank credit arrangements or raise funds from public or private equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would likely have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur 2017 Facility is a revolving credit facility with SVB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders to finance working capital and certain permitted acquisitions and investments. The 2017 Facility is available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes including acquisitions, and has a current borrowing capacity of $125.0 million. We have the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the 2017 Facility to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $63.0 million was outstanding under the 2017 Facility, no letters of credit were outstanding and $62.0 million remained available for borrowing under the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, and limit our capacity to incur other indebtedness, liens, make certain payments including dividends, and enter into other transactions without approval of the lenders. The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2017 Facility. Our outstanding amounts under the 2017 Facility are due at maturity in October 2022. The 2017 Facility is discussed in more detail below under \"Debt Obligations.\"\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay dividends during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. We cannot provide any assurance that we will declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by restrictions\nunder the terms of the agreements governing the 2017 Facility. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(73,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168,795\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) / from financing activities\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable and inventory, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation.\nFor 2019, cash flows from operating activities were $47.1 million, compared to $60.7 million for 2018. This $13.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $31.8 million increase in net income and a $16.0 million increase in non-cash items.\nThe $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, and such settlement amount was subsequently paid during 2019. The decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was also due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements. The $16.0 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.1 million change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. Additionally, the increase in non-cash items was due to a $7.2 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2019, partially offset by a gain of $6.9 million recorded during 2019 related to the proceeds from the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note received from one of our hardware suppliers.\nFor 2018, cash flows from operating activities were $60.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million from 2017, as the result of a $13.5 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities partially offset by a $7.7 million decrease in net income and a $2.3 million decrease in non-cash items.\nThe $13.5 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, which was not paid as of December 31, 2018. This increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in the change in inventory related to the purchase of long lead-time parts, a $2.8 million settlement of the liability related to the subsidiary unit awards during 2018 and differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements.\nThe $2.3 million decrease in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in the change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. This decrease in non-cash items was partially offset by a $6.0 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2018. Additionally, there was a $4.0 million increase in amortization and depreciation primarily due to the additional amortization of customer relationships, developed technology and trade name intangibles acquired from the Acquisition in the first quarter of 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities typically include acquisitions, capital expenditures, notes receivable issued to companies with offerings complementary to ours and proceeds from the repayment of those notes receivable. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business use, including leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount, computer equipment used internally, and expansion of our network operations centers.\nFor 2019, our cash flows used in investing activities was $73.4 million as compared to $13.4 million in 2018. The $60.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $58.8 million, net of cash acquired, for 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. The increase in cash used in investing activities was also due to $22.4 million paid in 2019 for the Acquired Promissory Note, $3.7 million of additional funding provided to the hardware supplier under the Promissory Notes in 2019 and $5.1 million paid for the purchase of land and a commercial building in 2019. The increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by $30.7 million received from one of our hardware suppliers for the amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note.\nFor 2018, our cash flows used in investing activities was $13.4 million as compared to $168.8 million in 2017. The $155.4 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $154.3 million, net of cash acquired, for our acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities typically includes repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt.\nFor 2019, cash flows used in financing activities was $0.1 million compared to cash flows from financing activities of $2.4 million in 2018. The $2.5 million change in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $2.5 million in the issuance of common stock under equity-based plans.\nFor 2018, cash flows from financing activities was $2.4 million compared to $67.3 million in 2017. The $64.9 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the $64.3 million of net proceeds borrowed under the credit facilities during 2017 related to the Acquisition in March 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is information about our material contractual obligations and the periods in which those future payments are due as of December 31, 2019. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates. As of December 31, 2019, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused line fee payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subsidiary unit award liabilities2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) The 2017 Facility incurs interest at a variable rate. The projected variable interest payments assume no change in the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR, from December 31, 2019. \n (2) Represents the current portion of our expected cash payments for our liability to repurchase subsidiary unit awards for our professional residential property management and vacation rental management subsidiary. \n (3) Represents amounts due under multi-year, non-cancelable contracts with third-party vendors, as well as other commitments. \nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit under our 2017 Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nDebt Obligations\nOn October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Upon entry into the 2017 Facility, we borrowed $72.0 million, which was used to repay the previously outstanding balance under our previous credit facility. The 2017 Facility matures in October 2022 and includes an option to further increase the borrowing capacity to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders. Costs incurred in connection with the 2017 Facility were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. During each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we repaid $4.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2017 Facility.\nThe outstanding principal balance on the 2017 Facility accrues interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we elected for the outstanding principal balance to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, LIBOR plus 1.75%, LIBOR plus 2.00%, and LIBOR plus 2.50% when our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 1.00:1.00 but less than 2.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00 but less than 3.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, respectively. The 2017 Facility also carries an unused line commitment fee of 0.20%. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the effective interest rate on the credit facilities was 4.45%, 4.13% and 4.16%, respectively.\nThe carrying value of the 2017 Facility was $63.0 million and $67.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2017 Facility includes a variable interest rate that approximates market rates and, as such, we classified the liability as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and determined that the carrying amount of the 2017 Facility approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.00 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants and there were no events of default. The 2017 Facility also contains customary conditions to borrowings and events of default and contains various negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur encumbrances, make certain payments including dividends, make investments or engage in transactions with affiliates without approval of the lenders.\nOn November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that must be met for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly,\nwe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, interest income and other income, net\n</td> <td>(8,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for / (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>5,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,825\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization and depreciation expense\n</td> <td>22,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>20,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expense\n</td> <td>2,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation expense\n</td> <td>12,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjustments\n</td> <td>54,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nAlarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 100 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.\nOur solutions are delivered through an established network of over 9,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. Our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, gateway modules and smart thermostats. We believe that the length of our service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust platforms and approximately 20 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.\nOur technology platforms are designed to make connected properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our solutions are used in both smart residential and commercial properties, which we refer to as the connected property market and we have designed our technology platforms for all market participants. This includes not only the residential and commercial property owners who subscribe to our services, but also the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who install and maintain our solutions.\nOur service provider partners can deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers. Our technology enables subscribers to seamlessly connect to their property through our family of mobile apps, websites, and new engagement platforms like voice control through Amazon Echo and Google Home, wearable devices like the Apple Watch, and TV platforms such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV.\nExecutive Overview and Highlights of 2019 and 2018 Results\nWe primarily generate SaaS and license revenue, our largest source of revenue, through our service provider partners who resell our services and pay us monthly fees. Our service provider partners sell, install and support Alarm.com solutions that enable residential and commercial property owners to intelligently secure, connect, control and automate their properties. Our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential or commercial property owners. Our subscribers consist of all of the properties maintained by those residential and commercial property owners to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. We derive a portion of our revenue from licensing our intellectual property to third parties on a per customer basis. SaaS and license revenue represented 67%, 69% and 70% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our non-hosted software platform, or Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Software license revenue represented 9%, 10% and 9% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe also generate revenue from the sale of hardware, including video cameras, video recorders, cellular radio modules, thermostats, image sensors and other peripherals, that enables our solutions. We have a rich history of innovation in cellular technology that enables our robust SaaS offering. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Hardware and other revenue represented 33%, 31% and 30% of\nour revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We typically expect hardware and other revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nHighlights of our financial performance for the periods covered in this Annual Report include:\n \u2022 SaaS and license revenue increased 16% to $337.4 million in 2019 from $291.1 million in 2018. SaaS and license revenue increased 23% to $291.1 million in 2018 from $236.3 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Total revenue increased 19% to $502.4 million in 2019 from $420.5 million in 2018. Total revenue increased 24% to $420.5 million in 2018 from $338.9 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Net income attributable to common stockholders was $53.5 million in 2019, $21.5 million in 2018 and $29.2 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance, increased to $108.3 million in 2019 from $93.1 million in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $93.1 million in 2018 from $71.6 million in 2017. \nPlease see Non-GAAP Measures below in this section of this Annual Report for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nGeographic Areas\nWe believe there is significant opportunity to expand our international business, as 3% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 originated from customers located outside of North America. Our products are currently localized and available in approximately 40 countries outside of North America.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of PC Open Incorporated, a Washington corporation, doing business as OpenEye. OpenEye provides cloud-managed video surveillance solutions for the enterprise commercial market. We believe the acquisition of OpenEye will provide a key element to our comprehensive suite of interactive cloud-based services spanning video, access control, intrusion and automation for domestic and international commercial enterprises.\nIn consideration for the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye, we paid $61.2 million in cash on October 21, 2019, after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million is payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets are met. The purchase price allocation, which is pending until the final determination of the working capital and tax adjustments, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Business Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the way similar business metrics used by other companies are calculated and include the following (dollars in thousands):\n\nSaaS and License Revenue\nWe believe that SaaS and license revenue is an indicator of the productivity of our existing service provider partners and their ability to activate and maintain subscribers using our intelligently connected property solutions, our ability to add new service provider partners reselling our solutions, the demand for our intelligently connected property solutions and the pace at which the market for these solutions is growing.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related adjustments and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures in this section for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nSaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate\nWe measure our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on a trailing 12-month basis by dividing (a) the total SaaS and license revenue recognized during the trailing 12-month period from our subscribers on our Alarm.com platform who were subscribers on the first day of the period, by (b) total SaaS and license revenue we would have recognized during the period from those same subscribers assuming no terminations, or service level upgrades or downgrades. The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage. Our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe that our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the lifetime value of our subscriber base.\nLeases (Topic 842)\nOn February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d or Topic 842, which requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use, or ROU, assets on the balance sheet. The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the update to allow entities to apply the transition requirements of Topic 842 at the adoption date rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Accordingly, the amendments in Topic 842 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 by applying the modified retrospective approach to all of our leases in effect as of that date. We used the optional transition method, which required us to record the initial effect of Topic 842 as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019. Additionally, we elected to use the package of practical expedients for the adoption of Topic 842, which allowed us not to reassess: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) whether initial direct costs for any existing leases qualify for capitalization under Topic 842. We also used the hindsight practical expedient when determining the lease term and assessing impairment of ROU assets.\nThe adoption of Topic 842 resulted in the recording of the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\n\nThe adoption of Topic 842 did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of equity and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOur fiscal year ends on December 31. The key elements of our operating results include:\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners' customers.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized.\nWe offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. In addition, in certain markets our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility's or market's control.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Hardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, and manufacturing facilities and factories across China. We anticipate there could be some disruption to our hardware supply chain due to the impact of the coronavirus on manufacturing and production in China. However, as the potential impact on global supply chains from the coronavirus is difficult to predict, the extent to which the coronavirus may negatively affect our hardware revenue is uncertain.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras and video recorders, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Our cost of hardware and other revenue also includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.\nWe record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nIn 2019, the U.S. administration has called for significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Beginning in May 2019, certain of our video camera products became subject to a 25% import duty. Additionally, beginning in September 2019, certain of our video cameras and sensors became subject to a 15% import duty. Approximately one-third to one-half of the finished goods hardware products that we sell to our service provider partners are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. We continue to monitor the changes in tariffs. If tariffs are increased or are expanded to apply to more of our products, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and amortization and depreciation expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories, excluding amortization and depreciation. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options and other forms of equity compensation in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient's function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development). We grew from 884 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 1,160 employees as of December 31, 2019, and we expect to continue to hire new employees to support the projected future growth of our business.\nSales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, travel, and commissions. Our sales and marketing teams engage in sales, account management, service provider partner support, advertising, promotion of our products and services and marketing.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions increased from 288 as of January 1, 2019 to 391 as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to expand our business both domestically and internationally and, as a result, expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis. We intend to increase the size of our sales force and our service provider partner support team to provide additional support to our existing service provider partner base to drive their productivity in selling our solutions as well as to enroll new service provider partners in North America and in international markets.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Additional expenses included in this category are legal costs, including those that are incurred to defend and license our intellectual property, as well as non-personnel costs, such as travel related expenses, rent, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and insurance expenses. Also included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition-related expenses, which consist primarily of legal, accounting and professional service fees directly related to acquisitions, valuation gains or losses on acquisition-related contingent liabilities.\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 96 as of January 1, 2019 to 148 as of December 31, 2019. Excluding intellectual property litigation and acquisition-related costs, we expect general and administrative costs to increase prospectively as our business grows. This includes cost increases related to accounting, finance, and legal personnel, additional external legal, audit fees and other expenses associated with regulations governing public companies. While somewhat unpredictable, we also expect to continue to incur costs related to litigation involving intellectual property. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding litigation matters.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 500 as of January 1, 2019 to 621 as of December 31, 2019. Our research and development efforts are focused on innovating new features and enhancing the functionality of our platforms and the solutions we offer to our service provider partners and subscribers. We will also continue to invest in efforts to extend our platforms to adjacent markets and internationally. We expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue in the short term to maintain our leadership position in the development of intelligently connected property technology, and continued enhancement of our Enterprise Tools platform for our service provider partners.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation consists of amortization of intangible assets originating from our acquisitions as well as our internally-developed capitalized software. Our depreciation expense is related to investments in property and equipment. Acquired intangible assets include developed technology, customer related intangibles, trademarks and trade names. We expect in the near term that amortization and depreciation may fluctuate based on our acquisition activity, development of our platforms and capitalized expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with our credit facilities. On October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The 2017 Facility is available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes, as permitted under the terms of the 2017 Facility. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and our notes receivable.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gains earned on our notes receivable and conversion of our outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment, partially offset by an impairment of one of our investments.\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This legislation made significant changes in U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Our effective tax rates were different from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based payment transactions, foreign derived intangible income deductions and research and development tax credits claimed, and state taxes, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible meal and entertainment expenses and state taxes. We recognize excess tax windfall benefits on a discrete basis in the quarter in which it occurs, and we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price and exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans each period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented (in thousands). Certain previously reported amounts in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation to reflect interest income as a separate line item, which was previously included in other income, net.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n_______________\n (1) Excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses below. \n (2) Operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands): \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue:\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\nThe following tables in this section set forth our selected consolidated statements of operations (in thousands), data for the percentage change and data as a percentage of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Certain previously reported amounts in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation to reflect interest income as a separate line item, which was previously included in other income, net.\nRevenue\n\nThe $81.9 million increase in total revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of a $46.3 million, or 16%, increase in our SaaS and license revenue and a $35.6 million, or 27%, increase in our hardware and other revenue. Our software license revenue included within SaaS and license revenue increased $2.1 million to $43.4 million in 2019 as compared to $41.3 million during 2018. The increase in our Alarm.com segment SaaS and license revenue in 2019 was primarily due to growth in our subscriber base, including the revenue impact from subscribers we added in 2018. To a lesser extent, SaaS and license revenue increased in the period due to an increase in license fees. The increase in hardware and other revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in the volume of video cameras sold. Our Other segment contributed 15% of the increase in SaaS and license revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in SaaS and license revenue for our Other segment in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in sales of our energy management and demand response solutions and our property management and HVAC solutions. Hardware and other revenue in our Other segment decreased 13% in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the timing of sales related to our remote access management solution.\nCost of Revenue\n\n________________\n(1) Excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nThe $37.9 million increase in cost of revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of a $32.8 million, or 32%, increase in cost of hardware and other revenue and a $5.1 million, or 11%, increase in cost of SaaS and license revenue. Our cost of software license revenue included within cost of SaaS and license revenue decreased $0.4 million to $1.3 million during 2019 as compared to $1.7 million during 2018. The increase in cost of Alarm.com segment hardware and other revenue related primarily to an increase in the number of hardware units shipped in 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in cost of\nAlarm.com segment SaaS and license revenue related primarily to the growth in our subscriber base, which drove a corresponding increase in amounts paid to wireless network providers.\nCost of hardware and other revenue as a percentage of hardware and other revenue was 81% and 78% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue was 15% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Cost of software license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue was 3% and 4% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in cost of hardware and other revenue as a percentage of hardware and other revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 is a reflection of the mix of product sales during the periods.\nSales and Marketing Expense\n\nThe $5.9 million increase in sales and marketing expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increases in headcount for our sales team and service provider partner support team to support our growth. As a result, our personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment, including salary, benefits, stock-based compensation and travel expenses, increased by $8.1 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. Additionally, recruiting costs and costs for external consultants increased by $0.3 million in 2019 for our Alarm.com segment as compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in our marketing expense for our Alarm.com segment in 2019 as compared to 2018. Sales and marketing expense from our Other segment increased $1.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to increases in headcount for our sales team. The overall number of employees in our sales and marketing teams increased from 288 as of December 31, 2018 to 391 as of December 31, 2019. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was 12% and 13% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense \nThe $25.8 million decrease in general and administrative expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to a $31.6 million decrease in legal expenses within our Alarm.com segment resulting from a $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA within our Alarm.com segment. Additionally, the decrease in general and administrative expense was due to the 2019 reversal of the $3.3 million reserve previously recorded in 2018, relating to a promissory note provided to one of our hardware suppliers within our Alarm.com segment. These decreases were partially offset by a $7.2 million increase in personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment due to an increase in employee headcount to support our operational growth and a $2.7 million increase in rent expense within the Alarm.com segment due in part to additional office space obtained for our corporate headquarters. General and administrative expenses from our Other segment decreased by $0.5 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in expense for external consultants. The overall number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 96 as of December 31, 2018 to 148 as of December 31, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expense \nThe $25.2 million increase in research and development expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in headcount of employees in research and development functions. Our personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment increased by $20.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 and our expenses for external consultants increased by $1.2 million. Additionally, the increase in research and development expense is due to $1.0 million of in-process research and development we acquired on September 18, 2019. Research and development expense from our Other segment decreased by $0.2 million due to a decrease in our expenses for external consultants in 2019 as compared to 2018. The overall number of employees in research and development functions increased from 500 as of December 31, 2018 to 621 as of December 31, 2019.\nAmortization and Depreciation\n\nAmortization and depreciation increased $0.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to customer relationships, developed technology and trade name intangibles acquired in connection with our March 2017 acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Connect line of business and all of the outstanding equity interests of the two subsidiaries through which Icontrol Networks, Inc. conducted its Piper line of business, as well as the customer relationships, developed technology and trade name intangibles acquired in connection with our October 2019 acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. These increases are partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized prior to December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased $0.1 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in the effective interest rate on the 2017 Facility resulting from the increase in the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR.\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income increased $2.7 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to recording interest income of $1.7 million related to promissory note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and proceeds from an acquired promissory note within our Alarm.com segment.\nOther Income, Net\n\nOther income, net increased $6.4 million during 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to recording a gain of $6.9 million related to promissory note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and proceeds from an acquired promissory note within our Alarm.com segment, partially offset by a $0.6 million impairment of one of our investments.\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes increased $15.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our effective tax rate was 9.5% in 2019 as compared to (84.0)% in 2018. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily related to decreases in tax windfall benefits and research and development tax credits claimed, partially offset by increased foreign derived intangible income deductions claimed in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017\nA comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.\nQuarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)\nThe following table shows selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of our eight most recently completed quarters, as well as the percentage of revenue for each line item. In the opinion of management, the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals, necessary for the fair statement of financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in future periods, and operating results for quarterly periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a full year.\nThe selected consolidated statements of operation data in amounts and as a percentage of total revenue are presented below (amounts in thousands):\n\nQuarterly Trends\nOur quarterly SaaS and license revenue has increased sequentially for all periods presented due to growth in our subscriber base driven by the effectiveness of our service provider partners' ability to resell our services and due to service providers and their subscribers on our Software platform. Hardware and other revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on the timing of hardware orders from our service providers and hardware distributors.\nThe cost of revenue, in absolute dollars, has increased over time corresponding to the increase in revenue. The cost of revenue as a percent of revenue is lower in quarters when SaaS and license revenue represents a greater percentage of total revenue. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue has been between 14% and 16% for all periods presented.\nOperating expenses have generally increased over time. Our most significant operating expenses are employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Research and development personnel have attributed to approximately 46% of our headcount increase over the eight quarters presented. We continue to invest in research and development to enhance our SaaS solution capabilities for both our residential and commercial subscribers and to enhance our suite of enterprise tools that enable our service provider partners to expand their business. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $28.0 million expense related to an agreement reached in 2018 to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded interest of $1.7 million within interest income and recorded a $6.9 million gain within other income, net, which relates to promissory note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and proceeds from an acquired promissory note.\nSegment Information\nWe have two reportable segments: Alarm.com and Other. Our Alarm.com segment represents our cloud-based and Software platforms for the intelligently connected property and related solutions that contributed 93%, 93% and 94% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our Other segment is focused on researching, developing and offering residential and commercial automation solutions and energy management products and services in adjacent markets. The consolidated subsidiaries that make up our Other segment are in the investment stage and have incurred significant operating expenses relative to their revenue.\nOur Alarm.com segment increased from 803 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 1,076 employees as of December 31, 2019. Our Other segment increased from 81 employees as of January 1, 2019 to 84 employees as of December 31, 2019. Inter-segment revenue includes sales of hardware between our segments.\nThe following table presents our revenue, inter-segment revenue and operating expenses by segment (in thousands):\n\nOur SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment included software license revenue of $43.4 million, $41.3 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was no software license revenue recorded for the Other segment during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, costs and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners' customers.\nTo determine the transaction price, we analyze all of the performance obligations included in the contract. We consider the terms of the contract and our customary business practices, which typically do not include financing components or non-cash consideration. We have variable consideration in the form of retrospective volume discounts, rebate incentives, restocking fees and assurance-type warranties. The significant inputs related to variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and the historical and expected number of returns. Depending on the type of variable consideration and its predictability, we may apply an expected value\u201d approach or a most likely amount\u201d approach. We estimate the variable consideration at the onset of a contract and include the variable consideration within the transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of the variable consideration would not occur in the future. When determining whether the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price should be constrained, we look at the history of hardware purchased and subscribers added by our service provider partners to estimate the likelihood of those service provider partners obtaining the retrospective volume discounts and rebates. At times, our contracts include consideration payable to a customer in the form of fixed discounts or rebates. We record the consideration payable to a customer as a reduction to the transaction price resulting in a reduction to revenue over the service period.\nIf we enter into contracts that contain multiple promised services, we evaluate which of the promised services represent separate performance obligations based on whether or not the promised services are distinct and whether or not the services are separable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are met, then we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price method at contract inception.\nIn determining the relative estimated selling prices, we consider market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. Any discount within the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract unless the terms of discount relate specifically to the entity's efforts to satisfy some but not all of the performance obligations.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. We also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. We recognize revenue from SaaS services on a monthly basis as we satisfy our performance obligations.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. Under the usage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors and peripherals. We recognize hardware and other revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations, which primarily occurs when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor, net of a reserve for estimated returns.\nWhen determining the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to for the sale of our hardware, we estimate the variable consideration associated with customer returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our reserve against revenue for hardware returns was 1%, 2% and 2% of hardware and other revenue, respectively. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Historically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve. Additionally, we provide assurance-type warranties related to the intended functionality of the products and services provided and those warranties typically allow for the return of hardware up to one year past the date of sale. These warranties were not identified as separate performance obligations.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property that is functional in nature and has significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional intellectual property, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs once the software has been made available to the customer.\nHardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee. We record activation fees initially as deferred revenue and we recognize these fees ratably over the expected term of the subscribers' account which we estimate is ten years based on our annual attrition rate.\nWe do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to recognize revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our SaaS and license revenue as well as our hardware and other revenue.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity.\nThe liability for the subsidiary unit awards relates to agreements established with employees of our subsidiaries for cash awards contingent upon the subsidiary companies meeting certain financial milestones such as revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin and was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs. We account for these subsidiary awards using fair value and establish liabilities for the future payment for the repurchase of subsidiary units under the terms of the agreements based on estimating revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin of the subsidiary units over the periods of the awards through the anticipated repurchase dates. We estimated the fair value of each liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The fair value of each liability is calculated with thousands of projected outcomes, the results of which are averaged and then discounted to estimate the present value. At each reporting date until the respective payment dates, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach based on the applicable subsidiary's revenue and future collection of financed customer receivables, the unobservable inputs, and we will record any changes in the employee's compensation expense. Some of the awards are subject to the employees' continued employment and therefore recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. The liability for the subsidiary unit awards was $0.2 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe liability for the contingent consideration consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and has a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and establish a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. The liability for the contingent consideration was $2.6 million as of December 31, 2019.\nBased on these assessments of fair value, we remeasured the liabilities valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs and recorded a reduction of $0.2 million in operating expenses within the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the subsidiary unit awards or the contingent consideration. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the subsidiary unit awards or the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, we may be exposed to additional operating expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe compensate our executive officers, board of directors, employees and consultants with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense based upon the award's grant date fair value and use an accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to estimate the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be\noutstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options.\nWe do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our stock-based compensation expense.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in valuing intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, discount rates, attrition rates related to acquired customer relationships, royalty rates and obsolescence factors related to acquired developed technology and royalty rates relate to acquired trade names.\nDuring the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nSome acquisitions may include contingent consideration, which is an obligation to make future payments to the seller contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets. We estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing contingent consideration include estimates about future financial results, revenue volatility and the discount rate. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination, over (2) the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization. The amount of goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nFor our 2019 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2019. Our assessment was performed as of October 1, 2019, and we have determined there have been no triggering events from our assessment date through December 31, 2019.\nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we determined there were no indicators of impairment of our intangible assets with definite lives or long-lived assets.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification, or ASC 740, \"Income Taxes,\" which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Due to the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets related to our Canadian net operating losses and research and development tax credits, we established a valuation allowance of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2019, which remained at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, based on our historical and expected future taxable earnings, we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize all of the benefit of the existing deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we did not record a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties as a component of our income tax provision.\nImpairment of Notes Receivable\nNotes receivable are presented net of an allowance for uncollectibility, if any. We accrue interest on notes receivable based on the contractual terms of the note. Outstanding notes receivable that are aged 30 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. Notes receivable are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. We periodically assess our notes receivable for collectibility and impairment by considering internal factors such as payment status, collateral value, the probability of collecting payments when due and credit quality as well as external factors such as economic conditions. We do not accrue interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are greater than 90 days past due based on their contractual payment terms. Notes receivable may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management's opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a note receivable has been placed in nonaccrual status, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A note receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer's delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured.\nBased on our assessment of the collectibility of a promissory note provided to one of our hardware suppliers, we recorded an impairment of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was subsequently reversed during the year ended December 31, 2019 upon receiving a payment from our hardware supplier. If changes in the assumptions used to assess the collectibility and impairment of our notes receivable occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and working capital, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nWe define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 are available for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes, and our investment policy is to invest any excess cash in short term, highly liquid investments that limit the risk of principal loss; therefore, our cash and cash equivalents are held in demand deposit accounts that generate very low returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $119.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. To date, we have principally financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and, to a lesser extent, through private and public equity financings.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our 2017 Facility, and our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be approximately $18.0 million, primarily related to the continued build out of our leased and owned office space, as well as purchases of computer software and equipment. In February 2020, we made a prepayment of $4.7 million for long lead-time parts related to our inventory. On August 30, 2018, we reached an agreement in principle to settle a putative class action lawsuit filed against us and Alarm.com Incorporated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The tentative settlement was subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement and Court approval. On October 25, 2018, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement, or the Settlement Agreement, with the plaintiffs. An initial payment of $5.0 million was made by us to the settlement administrator on January 2, 2019 and the remaining payment of $23.0 million was made on September 30, 2019.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a subordinate convertible promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers, or the October 2018 Promissory Note, which was amended in November 2018, January 2019 and February 2019 as a result of the hardware supplier's financial restructuring. In March 2019, we entered into a separate secured promissory note with the same hardware supplier, which, together with the October 2018 Promissory Note, we refer to as the Promissory Notes. Under the Promissory Notes, we agreed to provide the hardware supplier loans of up to $7.4 million, collateralized by all assets owned by the supplier. In March 2019, we paid $16.4 million to acquire a secured promissory note, or the Acquired Promissory Note, that was originally executed between our hardware supplier and another third-party secured creditor. The Acquired Promissory Note had an outstanding balance of $26.6 million as of December 31, 2018, including interest. In addition to the $16.4 million paid in March 2019 for the Acquired Promissory Note, we agreed to pay the third-party secured creditor an additional $6.0 million, subject to certain contingencies measured as of May 4, 2019. Based on the outcome of those contingencies, we recorded a $6.0 million liability in March 2019 related to the Acquired Promissory Note and paid the $6.0 million contingent liability during the three months ended September 30, 2019.\nOn May 6, 2019, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the hardware supplier, or the Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement, the hardware supplier agreed to pay us the outstanding balance of principal and interest under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note before June 30, 2019. In consideration for the full and timely payments under the Forbearance Agreement, we agreed to temporarily forbear from exercising the remedies available to us with respect to the collateral securing the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On June 24, 2019, we entered into a Forbearance Extension Agreement with the hardware supplier, under which the hardware supplier agreed to pay us $7.4 million on or before June 24, 2019. In consideration for the $7.4 million payment under the Forbearance Extension Agreement, we\nagreed to temporarily forbear from exercising the remedies available to us with respect to the collateral securing the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note until July 10, 2019.\nOn June 24, 2019, we received a payment of $7.4 million from the hardware supplier for the partial satisfaction of amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On July 15, 2019, we received an additional payment of $25.0 million from the supplier and converted the remaining outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment in the hardware supplier.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was no remaining outstanding balance on the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Promissory Notes excluding interest was $3.3 million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets prior to any adjustments for impairment.\nOn September 18, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of in-process research and development, or IPR&D. In consideration for the purchase of the IPR&D, we paid $0.9 million in cash on September 18, 2019, with the remaining $0.1 million expected to be paid 18 months following the acquisition date, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations.\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye for $61.2 million in cash after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. The working capital adjustment is expected to be finalized and paid to the stockholders of OpenEye in the first half of 2020 along with a portion of the holdback. The remaining amount of the holdback is expected to be paid to the stockholders of OpenEye by the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million is payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets are met. We recorded a redeemable noncontrolling interest of $11.4 million on October 21, 2019 related to the remaining 15% equity interest owned by the minority OpenEye stockholders. The purchase price allocation, which is pending until the final determination of the working capital and tax adjustments, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2019, we purchased land and a commercial building located in Liberty Lake, Washington for $5.1 million. Once renovations are complete, this building will be used by OpenEye for sales and training, research and development, warehousing and administrative purposes.\nOur future working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in human resources and capital equipment, future acquisitions and investments, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new solutions and platform and solution enhancements. To the extent our cash and cash equivalents, together with our 2017 Facility, and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to borrow additional funds through our bank credit arrangements or raise funds from public or private equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would likely have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur 2017 Facility is a revolving credit facility with SVB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders to finance working capital and certain permitted acquisitions and investments. The 2017 Facility is available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes including acquisitions, and has a current borrowing capacity of $125.0 million. We have the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the 2017 Facility to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $63.0 million was outstanding under the 2017 Facility, no letters of credit were outstanding and $62.0 million remained available for borrowing under the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, and limit our capacity to incur other indebtedness, liens, make certain payments including dividends, and enter into other transactions without approval of the lenders. The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2017 Facility. Our outstanding amounts under the 2017 Facility are due at maturity in October 2022. The 2017 Facility is discussed in more detail below under \"Debt Obligations.\"\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay dividends during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. We cannot provide any assurance that we will declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by restrictions\nunder the terms of the agreements governing the 2017 Facility. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable and inventory, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation.\nFor 2019, cash flows from operating activities were $47.1 million, compared to $60.7 million for 2018. This $13.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $31.8 million increase in net income and a $16.0 million increase in non-cash items.\nThe $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, and such settlement amount was subsequently paid during 2019. The decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was also due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements. The $16.0 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.1 million change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. Additionally, the increase in non-cash items was due to a $7.2 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2019, partially offset by a gain of $6.9 million recorded during 2019 related to the proceeds from the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note received from one of our hardware suppliers.\nFor 2018, cash flows from operating activities were $60.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million from 2017, as the result of a $13.5 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities partially offset by a $7.7 million decrease in net income and a $2.3 million decrease in non-cash items.\nThe $13.5 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, which was not paid as of December 31, 2018. This increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in the change in inventory related to the purchase of long lead-time parts, a $2.8 million settlement of the liability related to the subsidiary unit awards during 2018 and differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements.\nThe $2.3 million decrease in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in the change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. This decrease in non-cash items was partially offset by a $6.0 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2018. Additionally, there was a $4.0 million increase in amortization and depreciation primarily due to the additional amortization of customer relationships, developed technology and trade name intangibles acquired from the Acquisition in the first quarter of 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities typically include acquisitions, capital expenditures, notes receivable issued to companies with offerings complementary to ours and proceeds from the repayment of those notes receivable. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business use, including leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount, computer equipment used internally, and expansion of our network operations centers.\nFor 2019, our cash flows used in investing activities was $73.4 million as compared to $13.4 million in 2018. The $60.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $58.8 million, net of cash acquired, for 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. The increase in cash used in investing activities was also due to $22.4 million paid in 2019 for the Acquired Promissory Note, $3.7 million of additional funding provided to the hardware supplier under the Promissory Notes in 2019 and $5.1 million paid for the purchase of land and a commercial building in 2019. The increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by $30.7 million received from one of our hardware suppliers for the amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note.\nFor 2018, our cash flows used in investing activities was $13.4 million as compared to $168.8 million in 2017. The $155.4 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $154.3 million, net of cash acquired, for our acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities typically includes repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt.\nFor 2019, cash flows used in financing activities was $0.1 million compared to cash flows from financing activities of $2.4 million in 2018. The $2.5 million change in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $2.5 million in the issuance of common stock under equity-based plans.\nFor 2018, cash flows from financing activities was $2.4 million compared to $67.3 million in 2017. The $64.9 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the $64.3 million of net proceeds borrowed under the credit facilities during 2017 related to the Acquisition in March 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is information about our material contractual obligations and the periods in which those future payments are due as of December 31, 2019. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates. As of December 31, 2019, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\n\n_______________\n (1) The 2017 Facility incurs interest at a variable rate. The projected variable interest payments assume no change in the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR, from December 31, 2019. \n (2) Represents the current portion of our expected cash payments for our liability to repurchase subsidiary unit awards for our professional residential property management and vacation rental management subsidiary. \n (3) Represents amounts due under multi-year, non-cancelable contracts with third-party vendors, as well as other commitments. \nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit under our 2017 Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nDebt Obligations\nOn October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Upon entry into the 2017 Facility, we borrowed $72.0 million, which was used to repay the previously outstanding balance under our previous credit facility. The 2017 Facility matures in October 2022 and includes an option to further increase the borrowing capacity to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders. Costs incurred in connection with the 2017 Facility were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. During each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we repaid $4.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2017 Facility.\nThe outstanding principal balance on the 2017 Facility accrues interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we elected for the outstanding principal balance to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, LIBOR plus 1.75%, LIBOR plus 2.00%, and LIBOR plus 2.50% when our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 1.00:1.00 but less than 2.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00 but less than 3.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, respectively. The 2017 Facility also carries an unused line commitment fee of 0.20%. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the effective interest rate on the credit facilities was 4.45%, 4.13% and 4.16%, respectively.\nThe carrying value of the 2017 Facility was $63.0 million and $67.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2017 Facility includes a variable interest rate that approximates market rates and, as such, we classified the liability as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and determined that the carrying amount of the 2017 Facility approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.00 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants and there were no events of default. The 2017 Facility also contains customary conditions to borrowings and events of default and contains various negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur encumbrances, make certain payments including dividends, make investments or engage in transactions with affiliates without approval of the lenders.\nOn November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that must be met for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly,\nwe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n", "item_7_tables": "Table
