Managing Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Managing Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions, including, among other things, factors discussed in Part I. Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our beneficial owners invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third-party end users or financed equipment for third parties and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. Some of our equipment leases were acquired for cash and were expected to provide current cash flow, which we refer to as income\u201d leases. For our other equipment leases, we financed the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties. We refer to these leases as growth\u201d leases. These growth leases generated little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments we received from the lessee were used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease. For these leases, we anticipated that the future value of the leased equipment would exceed our cash portion of the purchase price.\nOur Managing Trustee manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, under the terms of our Trust Agreement.\nOur offering period ended on April 30, 2009 and our operating period commenced on May 1, 2009. During our offering period, we raised total equity of $347,686,947. Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014 and our liquidation period commenced on May 1, 2014. During our liquidation period, we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Liquidating Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement that appointed our Manager as Managing Trustee of the Liquidating Trust. Prior to the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the LLC to the Liquidating Trust, the LLC's assets included investments in ICON Radiance, LLC, ICON Siva, LLC, ICON Victorious, LLC, ICON Mauritius MI, LLC, ICON Mauritius MI II, LLC, ICON Blackhawk, LLC, ICON Murray VII, LLC and a subordinated term loan to TMA. These investments, as well as all other assets and liabilities of the LLC, were transferred to the Liquidating Trust from the LLC on December 31, 2016 in order to reduce expenses and to maximize potential distributions to beneficial owners of the Liquidating Trust. On December 31, 2016, all Shares were exchanged for an equal number of Interests in the Liquidating Trust.\nThe financial position and results of operations of the LLC are presented as those of the Liquidating Trust retroactively to the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nCurrent Business Environment\nRecent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.\nOur Managing Trustee is cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy's recovery will continue throughout 2017 and into 2018. An overall improvement in the unemployment rate, which was 4.7% as of December 31, 2016, as well as price increases in energy and other commodities, have resulted in stock market gains and an increase in loan prices. However, continued increases in the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on net exports and energy and other commodity prices.\nThe equipment financing industry has encountered significant challenges over the past several years, as a result of, among other things, an unprecedented and prolonged weakness in global shipping and offshore markets. These challenges, among other factors, have caused us to record credit losses and/or impairment charges on certain of our investments (see Significant Transactions\u201d below).\nSignificant Transactions\nWe engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTelecommunications Equipment\nFrom July 15, 2010 through March 31, 2011, we purchased telecommunications equipment for $5,025,434 and simultaneously leased the equipment to Broadview Networks Holdings, Inc. and Broadview Networks Inc. (collectively, Broadview\u201d). The base term of the four leases was for a period of 36 months, which commenced between August 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011. On August 22, 2012, Broadview commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. On November 14, 2012, Broadview completed a prepackaged restructuring, emerged from bankruptcy and affirmed all of our leases. During the year ended December 31, 2013, upon the expiration of three leases, Broadview purchased telecommunications equipment subject to the leases from us for an aggregate purchase price of $460,725. On March 31, 2014, upon the expiration of the fourth lease, Broadview purchased telecommunications equipment subject to the lease from us for $293,090. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of these sales.\nCoal Drag Line\nOn July 9, 2012, Patriot Coal Corporation ( Patriot Coal\u201d) and substantially all of its subsidiaries, including Magnum Coal Company, LLC ( Magnum\u201d), commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. On March 11, 2013, we amended our lease with Magnum to expire on August 1, 2015. The terms of the amendment resulted in the reclassification of the lease from an operating lease to a finance lease. On May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease prior to its expiration date and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. After obtaining the bankruptcy court's approval, our bankruptcy claim against Patriot Coal was strengthened from an unsecured claim to an administrative claim. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis) and $46,057, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale of leased equipment.\nMarine Vessels and Equipment\nDuring 2009, we purchased three barges, the Leighton Mynx, the Leighton Stealth and the Leighton Eclipse, and a pipelay barge, the Leighton Faulkner (collectively, the Leighton Vessels\u201d), and simultaneously leased the Leighton Vessels to an affiliate of Leighton Offshore Pte. Ltd. ( Leighton\u201d) for a period of 96 months that were scheduled to expire between June 2017 and January 2018.\nOn May 16, 2013, Leighton provided notice to us that it was exercising its purchase options on the Leighton Vessels. On August 23, 2013, Leighton, in accordance with the terms of a bareboat charter scheduled to expire on June 25, 2017, exercised its option to purchase the Leighton Mynx from us for $25,832,445, including payment of swap-related expenses of $254,719. In addition, Leighton paid all break costs and legal fees incurred by us with respect to the sale of the Leighton Mynx. As a result of the termination of the lease and the sale of the vessel, we recognized additional finance income of $562,411. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Leighton Mynx were used to repay Leighton's seller's credits of $7,335,000 related to our original purchase of the barge as well as to satisfy third-party non-recourse debts related to the barge by making a payment of $13,290,982. As part of the repayment, the interest rate swaps related to the debts were terminated and a loss on derivative financial instruments of $210,779 was recognized. On April 3, 2014, Leighton, in accordance with the terms of three bareboat charters scheduled to expire between 2017 and 2018, exercised its options and purchased the three remaining Leighton Vessels from us for an aggregate price of $155,220,900, including payment of swap-related expenses of $720,900. As a result of the termination of the leases and the sale of the three remaining Leighton Vessels, we recognized additional finance income of $57,248,440. A portion of the aggregate purchase price due from the exercise of the purchase options was used to satisfy the Leighton seller's credits of $47,421,000 related to our original purchase of the three Leighton Vessels as well as to satisfy our non-recourse debt obligations with Standard Chartered of $38,425,536.\nOn June 25, 2009, we purchased marine diving equipment from Swiber Engineering Ltd. ( Swiber\u201d) for $10,000,000. Simultaneously, we entered into a 60-month lease with Swiber, which commenced on July 1, 2009. Subsequent to the expiration of the lease, on November 14, 2014, we sold the diving equipment to a subsidiary of Swiber Holdings Limited ( Swiber Holdings\u201d) for $4,000,000 net, after deducting the $2,000,000 seller's credit owed to Swiber.\nOn March 24, 2009, we and Swiber entered into a joint venture owned 51% by us and 49% by Swiber for the purpose of purchasing a 300-man accommodation and work barge, the Swiber Chateau (f/k/a the Swiber Victorious). Simultaneously with the purchase, the barge was chartered to Swiber Offshore Marine Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of Swiber ( Swiber Offshore\u201d), for 96 months, which expired on March 23, 2017. The Swiber Chateau was purchased for $42,500,000, which was funded by (i) a $19,125,000 equity investment from us, (ii) an $18,375,000 contribution-in-kind by Swiber and (iii) a $5,000,000 subordinated, non-recourse and unsecured payable from Swiber. The payable bore interest at 3.5% per year and is recorded within seller's credits on our consolidated balance sheets. If a default occurs under the charter, the joint venture will not be required to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable. Swiber Holdings, the parent company of Swiber and Swiber Offshore (together with Swiber and Swiber Offshore, the Swiber Group\u201d), guarantees the payment and performance obligations of Swiber Offshore and its affiliates under all transaction documents.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2016, we obtained a third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the barge as of June 27, 2016 was $17,875,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed an impairment test on the barge. Based on such test, we recorded an impairment loss of $5,218,643 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Swiber Offshore has also failed to make its monthly charter payments to the joint venture since July 2016. Pursuant to the joint venture's operating agreement, in the event that, among other things, (i) there is a default by Swiber Offshore under the charter, or (ii) the fair market value of the barge is less than $21,000,000, all of Swiber's interests in the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds resulting from the joint venture will be subordinate to our rights in such distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds until such time that we have received in distribution the return of the full amount of our contribution to the joint venture and a return at a monthly compounded rate equal to 15.51% per year. As the then current fair market value of the barge was less than $21,000,000, our Managing Trustee concluded that, commencing June 27, 2016, Swiber's rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return described above. Accordingly, the impairment loss recorded as of June 30, 2016 of $5,218,643 was allocated entirely to Swiber, the noncontrolling interest holder. As a result, the impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nOn July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. In November 2016, we obtained an updated third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the barge decreased to $14,770,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment loss of $3,105,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was allocated entirely to Swiber. The impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the three months ended September 30, 2016.\nOn November 28, 2016, Swiber Offshore filed an application for voluntary winding up and liquidation. Subsequently, our Managing Trustee has engaged in discussions with the court-appointed judicial manager of Swiber Holdings to, among other things, communicate our intention to sell the barge. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee commenced the process of marketing the barge for sale and it is currently engaged in negotiations with several interested parties. As of December 31, 2016, the barge met the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $7,170,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to write down the barge to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of $7,600,000. Swiber was only allocated $383,329 of such additional impairment loss because the balance of its noncontrolling interest in the joint venture had been reduced to zero. As a result, the remaining additional impairment loss of $6,786,671 was allocated to us during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Upon expiration of the charter on March 23, 2017, the joint venture's obligation to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable of $5,000,000 was extinguished pursuant to the purchase and charter agreement due to, among other things, Swiber Offshore's existing defaults on the charter. A gain of $5,000,000 from the extinguishment of the payable will be allocated entirely to us during the three months ending March 31, 2017.\nOn March 29, 2011, we and ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, entered into a joint venture, ICON AET Holdings, LLC (\"ICON AET\"), which was owned 25% by us and 75% by Fund Fourteen, for the purpose of acquiring two aframax tankers and two very large crude carriers (the \"VLCCs\", and collectively with the aframax tankers, the \"AET Vessels\"). Our contribution to the joint venture was $12,166,393. The aframax tankers, the Eagle Otome and the Eagle Subaru, were each acquired for $13,000,000 and were simultaneously bareboat chartered to AET Inc. Limited ( AET\u201d) for a period of three years. The VLCCs, the Eagle Vermont and the Eagle Virginia, were each acquired for $72,000,000 and were simultaneously bareboat chartered to AET for a period of 10 years. On April 14, 2014 and May 21, 2014, upon expiration of the leases with AET, ICON AET sold the aframax tankers to third-party purchasers for an aggregate price of $14,821,890. As a result, ICON AET recognized an aggregate gain on sale of assets of $2,229,932. Our share of such gain was $557,483, which is included within income from investment in joint ventures on our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. On June 8, 2016, an unaffiliated third party purchased 100% of the limited liability company interests of ICON AET for net sales proceeds of $48,798,058. As a result, we recorded a gain on sale of investment in joint venture of $2,012,669.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader (f/k/a the Arabian Express) were returned to us in accordance with the terms of the charters. Upon redelivery, the bareboat charters were terminated and we assumed the underlying time charters for the vessels. As we assumed operational responsibility of the vessels, we simultaneously contracted with Fleet Ship Management Inc. to manage the vessels on our behalf. Accordingly, these vessels were reclassified to Vessels on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, based on (i) the upcoming time charter expirations with no expectation that such charters would be renewed or timely replaced with new longer-term charter agreements and (ii) then current low time charter rates in the market, our Managing Trustee performed impairment analyses and concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. Our Managing Trustee estimated the fair market values of the vessels based on third-party valuations using a sales comparison approach. Based upon our Managing Trustee's assessment, the net book values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader exceeded their estimated undiscounted cash flows and their fair values and, as a result, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale and no further depreciation was recorded on the vessels. In September 2016, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were sold to unaffiliated third parties for a gross purchase price of $3,000,000 and $3,200,000, respectively. After deducting selling costs of $353,444, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of $303,943 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn March 21, 2014, a joint venture owned 75% by us, 12.5% by Fund Fourteen and 12.5% by ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P. ( Fund Fifteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, through two indirect subsidiaries, entered into memoranda of agreement to purchase the EPIC Vessels from Foreguard Shipping I Global Ships Ltd. (f/k/a Siva Global Ships Limited) ( Foreguard Shipping\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of $41,600,000. The EPIC Bali and the EPIC Borneo were delivered on March 28, 2014 and April 8, 2014, respectively. The EPIC Vessels were bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Foreguard Shipping for a period of eight years upon the delivery of each respective vessel. The EPIC Vessels were each acquired for approximately $3,550,000 in cash, $12,400,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB Group Merchant Bank (Asia) Ltd. ( DVB\u201d) and $4,750,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.\nOn June 12, 2014, a joint venture owned 75% by us, 12.5% by Fund Fourteen and 12.5% by Fund Fifteen purchased an offshore supply vessel from Pacific Crest Pte. Ltd. ( Pacific Crest\u201d) for $40,000,000. Simultaneously, the vessel was bareboat chartered to Pacific Crest for 10 years. The vessel was acquired for approximately $12,000,000 in cash, $26,000,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB and $2,000,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.\nManufacturing Equipment\nDuring 2008, ICON EAR, LLC ( ICON EAR\u201d), a joint venture owned 55% by us and 45% by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven Liquidating Trust (formerly, ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC) (\"Fund Eleven\"), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Equipment Acquisition Resources, Inc. ( EAR\u201d) for $15,729,500. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Managing Trustee filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ICON EAR sold its only remaining asset consisting of real property for $207,937. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale. Prior to the sale, ICON EAR recognized an impairment charge of $70,412 based on the then estimated fair value less cost to sell the real property.\nGiven the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Managing Trustee engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,209,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.\nOn January 4, 2012, MW Universal, Inc. ( MWU\u201d) and certain of its subsidiaries satisfied their obligations relating to two of the three lease schedules. On August 20, 2012, we sold the automotive manufacturing equipment subject to lease with LC Manufacturing, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MWU ( LC Manufacturing\u201d), and terminated warrants issued to us for aggregate proceeds of $8,300,000. As a result, based on our 93.67% ownership interest in ICON MW, LLC ( ICON MW\u201d), our joint venture with Fund Eleven, we received proceeds in the amount of $7,774,610 and recognized a loss on the sale of $88,786. In addition, our Managing Trustee evaluated the collectability of the personal guaranty of a previous owner of LC Manufacturing and, based on the findings, ICON MW recorded a credit loss of $5,411,484, of which our portion was $5,068,937. In February 2013, ICON MW commenced an action against the guarantor. On October 5, 2015, ICON MW received summary judgment against the guarantor on the issue of liability. A hearing to determine damages was held in July 2016. In September 2016, the court referee issued a report recommending a judgment in favor of ICON MW for (i) $5,660,000 in damages; (ii) $120,000 in attorney's fees; and (iii) $540,000 in prejudgment interest. The court confirmed the report and the recommended judgment in January 2017.\nMining Equipment\nOn September 12, 2013, a joint venture owned by us, Fund Eleven and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen ( Fund Sixteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, purchased mining equipment for $15,106,570. The equipment was subject to a 24-month lease with Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Murray\u201d). On December 1, 2013 and February 1, 2014, Fund Sixteen contributed capital of $933,678 and $1,725,517, respectively, to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees. Subsequent to Fund Sixteen's second capital contribution, the joint venture was owned 13.2% by us, 67% by Fund Eleven and 19.8% by Fund Sixteen. As a result, we received corresponding returns of capital. The lease was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2015, but was extended for one month with an additional lease payment of $635,512. On October 29, 2015, Murray purchased the equipment pursuant to the terms of the lease for $2,991,400. As a result, a gain on sale of assets of $448,710 was recognized by the joint venture, of which our share was $59,230. Pursuant to a remarketing agreement with a third party, the joint venture paid an aggregate remarketing fee of $766,466 as part of the transaction.\nOn March 4, 2014, a joint venture owned 60% by us, 15% by Fund Fourteen, 15% by Fund Fifteen and 10% by Fund Sixteen purchased mining equipment from an affiliate of Blackhawk Mining, LLC ( Blackhawk\u201d). Simultaneously, the mining equipment was leased to Blackhawk and its affiliates for four years. The aggregate purchase price for the mining equipment of $25,359,446 was funded by $17,859,446 in cash and $7,500,000 of non-recourse long-term debt with People's Capital and Leasing Corp. ( People's Capital\u201d). The loan bears interest at a rate of 6.5% per year and matures on February 1, 2018. On October 27, 2015, the joint venture amended the lease with Blackhawk to waive Blackhawk's breach of a financial covenant during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in consideration for a partial prepayment of $3,502,514, which included an amendment fee of $75,000. In addition, corresponding amendments were made to certain payment and repurchase provisions of the lease to account for the partial prepayment. On December 8, 2015 and December 7, 2016, the joint venture further amended the lease with Blackhawk to, among other things, add, revise and/or waive Blackhawk's breach of certain financial covenants and received additional amendment fees of $75,000 and $150,000, respectively.\nOn September 18, 2014, a joint venture owned 55.817% by us and 44.183% by Hardwood Partners, LLC ( Hardwood\u201d) purchased mining equipment for $6,789,928. The equipment is subject to a 36-month lease with Murray, which expires on September 30, 2017.\nTrucks and Trailers\nOn March 28, 2014, a joint venture owned 60% by us, 27.5% by Fund Fifteen and 12.5% by Fund Sixteen purchased trucks, trailers and other equipment from subsidiaries of D&T Holdings, LLC ( D&T\u201d) for $12,200,000. Simultaneously, the trucks, trailers and other equipment were leased to D&T and its subsidiaries for 57 months. On September 15, 2014, the lease agreement with D&T was amended to allow D&T to increase its capital expenditure limit. In consideration for agreeing to such increase, lease payments of $1,480,000 that were scheduled to be paid in 2018 were paid by October 31, 2014. In addition, the joint venture received an amendment fee of $100,000, which was to be recognized as finance income throughout the remaining lease term. On January 14, 2016, D&T satisfied its remaining lease obligations by making a prepayment of $8,000,000. In addition, D&T exercised its option to repurchase all assets under the lease for $1, upon which title was transferred. As a result of the prepayment, we recognized finance income of approximately $1,400,000.\nNotes Receivable\nOn June 29, 2009, we and Fund Fourteen entered into a joint venture for the purpose of making secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $20,000,000 to INOVA Rentals Corporation (f/k/a ARAM Rentals Corporation) and INOVA Seismic Rentals Inc. (f/k/a ARAM Seismic Rental Inc.) (collectively, the INOVA Borrowers\u201d), which were scheduled to mature on August 1, 2014. In 2011, we exchanged our 52.09% ownership interest in the joint venture for our proportionate share of the notes receivable owned by the joint venture, which was subsequently deconsolidated and then terminated. The loans bore interest at 15% per year and were secured by a first priority security interest in all analog seismic system equipment owned by the INOVA Borrowers, among other collateral. On January 31, 2014, the INOVA Borrowers satisfied their obligations in connection with the loans by making a prepayment of $1,671,858. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\nOn June 30, 2010, we made two secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $9,600,000, one to Ocean Navigation 5 Co. Ltd. and one to Ocean Navigation 6 Co. Ltd. (collectively, Ocean Navigation\u201d), as part of a $96,000,000 term loan facility. The loans were funded between July 2010 and September 2010 and proceeds from the facility were used by Ocean Navigation to purchase two aframax tanker vessels, the Shah Deniz and the Absheron. The loans bore interest at 15.25% per year and were for a period of six years maturing between July and September 2016. The loans were secured by a second priority security interest in the vessels. On April 15, 2014, we sold all our interest in the loans with Ocean Navigation to Garanti Bank International, N.V. for $9,600,000. As a result, we wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable of $455,420 as a charge against finance income.\nOn February 29, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,000,000 to VAS Aero Services, LLC ( VAS\u201d) as part of a $42,755,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at variable rates ranging between 12% and 14.5% per year and matured on October 6, 2014. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of VAS's assets. During the year ended December 31, 2014, VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the loan as well as the balloon payment due on the maturity date. Our Managing Trustee engaged in discussions with VAS, VAS's owners, the senior creditor and other second lien creditors in order to put in place a viable restructuring or refinancing plan. In December 2014, this specific plan to restructure or refinance fell through. While discussions on other options were still ongoing, our Managing Trustee determined that we should record a credit loss reserve based on an estimated liquidation value of VAS's inventory and accounts receivable. As a result, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss reserve of $631,986 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 based on our pro-rata share of the liquidation value of the collateral. The value of the collateral was based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Managing Trustee making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,665 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB Loan, LLC ( GB\u201d) for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,719 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. In addition, we wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of $1,329,370 during the year ended December 31, 2015. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss reserve was $197,741 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn July 24, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $500,000 to affiliates of Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. (collectively, Frontier\u201d) as part of a $5,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 14% per year and was for a period of 66 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Frontier's saltwater disposal wells and related equipment and a second priority security interest in Frontier's other assets, including real estate, machinery and accounts receivable. On October 11, 2013, Frontier made a partial prepayment of $86,524, which included a prepayment fee of $8,924 that was recognized as additional finance income. On December 30, 2014, we sold all of our interest in the loan to Frontier Expansion and Development, LLC for $375,000. As a result, we recognized a loss and wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable totaling $62,365 as a charge against finance income.\nOn September 10, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $4,080,000 to Superior Tube Company, Inc. and Tubes Holdco Limited (collectively, Superior\u201d) as part of a $17,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12% per year and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Superior's assets, including tube manufacturing and related equipment and a mortgage on real property, and a second priority security interest in Superior's accounts receivable and inventory. On January 30, 2015, Superior satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $4,191,328, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $122,038. As a result, we recognized additional finance income of $50,550.\nOn November 28, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $4,050,000 to SAExploration, Inc., SAExploration Seismic Services (US), LLC and NES, LLC (collectively, SAE\u201d) as part of an $80,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per year and was for a period of 48 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in all existing and thereafter acquired assets, including seismic testing equipment, of SAE and its parent company, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. ( SAE Holdings\u201d), and a pledge of all the equity interests in SAE and SAE Holdings. In addition, we acquired warrants, exercisable until December 5, 2022, to purchase 0.051% of the outstanding common stock of SAE Holdings. On October 31, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement with SAE to amend certain provisions and covenant ratios. As a result of the amendment, we received an amendment fee of $30,687. On July 2, 2014, SAE satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $4,591,523, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and prepayment fees of $449,389. The prepayment fees were recognized as additional finance income. On July 21, 2014, we exercised the warrants and received net cash proceeds of $14,208, which resulted in a loss of $43,126 that was recorded in loss on derivative financial instruments.\nOn February 12, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,700,000 to NTS Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NTS\u201d) as part of a $6,000,000 facility. On March 28, 2013, NTS borrowed $765,000 and on June 27, 2013, NTS drew down the remaining $1,935,000 from the facility. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2017. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in all equipment and assets of NTS. On June 6, 2014, NTS satisfied their obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,701,212, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $102,600. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn April 5, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $3,870,000 to Lubricating Specialties Company ( LSC\u201d) as part of an $18,000,000 facility. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per year and was scheduled to mature on August 1, 2018. The loan was secured by, among other things, a second priority security interest in LSC's liquid storage tanks, blending lines, packaging equipment, accounts receivable and inventory. On December 30, 2016, LSC satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,954,424, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $57,930. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn December 22, 2011, a joint venture owned 25% by us and 75% by Fund Fourteen made a $20,124,000 subordinated term loan to JAC as part of a $171,050,000 term loan facility. Our initial contribution to this joint venture was $6,313,875. On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 21% by us, 39% by Fund Eleven and 40% by Fund Fifteen purchased a portion of a $208,038,290 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered for $28,462,500. Our initial contribution to this joint venture was $6,456,034. The loan and the facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15% per year and mature in January 2021. As a result of JAC's failure to make an expected payment that was due to the joint ventures during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the interest rate payable by JAC under the loan and the facility increased from 12.5% to 15.5%. The loan and the facility are secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex.\nDuring 2015, JAC experienced liquidity constraints as a result of a general economic slow-down in China and India, which led to lower demand from such countries, as well as the price decline of energy and other commodities. As a result, JAC's manufacturing facility ceased operations and JAC was not able to service interest payments under the loan and the facility. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an expected tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers that would have allowed JAC's manufacturing facility to resume operations did not commence as originally anticipated. Accordingly, our Managing Trustee determined that there was doubt regarding the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility. Our Managing Trustee visited JAC's manufacturing facility and engaged in discussions with JAC's other stakeholders to agree upon a restructuring plan. Based upon such discussions, which included a potential conversion of a portion of the loan and the facility to equity and/or a restructuring of the loan and the facility, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures may potentially not be able to recover approximately $13,500,000 to $47,300,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC under the loan and the facility as of June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures recognized a total credit loss of $33,264,710, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome based upon the negotiations at the time. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $7,834,118. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures placed the loan and the facility on non-accrual status and ceased to recognize finance income. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, discussions among the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. Our Managing Trustee reassessed the collectability of the loan and the facility by considering the following factors: (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. Our Managing Trustee also considered the proposed plan of converting a portion of the loan and the facility to equity and/or restructuring the loan and the facility in the event that JAC's stakeholders recommenced discussions. Based upon such reassessment, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures may potentially not be able to recover approximately $41,200,000 to $51,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC under the loan and the facility prior to recording the initial total credit loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the joint ventures recognized an additional total credit loss of $16,856,310, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,856,928.\nIn January 2016, our Managing Trustee engaged in further discussions with JAC's other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC's manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Managing Trustee anticipated that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC's manufacturing facility to recommence operations. Our Managing Trustee updated the collectability analysis under the loan and the facility as of December 31, 2015 and determined that comparable enterprise values derived from EBITDA multiples and trading prices of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries each decreased. In addition, our Managing Trustee considered that, as of December 31, 2015, (i) a tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers did not commence as originally anticipated; (ii) no further discussions occurred between JAC, the joint ventures, the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan and (iii) JAC's manufacturing facility continued to be non-operational. Based upon these factors, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility could result in less of a recovery from its prior estimate. As a result, our Managing Trustee determined to record an additional total credit loss of $10,137,863, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2,319,835. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Managing Trustee believes that the marketability of JAC's manufacturing facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Managing Trustee does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint ventures while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to $55,000,000, to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Managing Trustee determined that the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility was further in doubt. As of June 30, 2016, our Managing Trustee updated its quarterly assessment and also considered the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint ventures' loan and facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Managing Trustee determined that the joint ventures should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the loan and the facility due from JAC as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the joint ventures recorded an additional total credit loss of $10,137,863 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of which our share was $2,319,835. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Receiver formally commenced the process of marketing JAC's manufacturing facility for sale. Our Managing Trustee continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC, the receivership process and the marketing process for sale of the manufacturing facility through regular communications with the Receiver and certain other stakeholders. The joint ventures did not recognize any finance income for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the joint ventures recognized finance income of $2,136,688 and $7,356,011, respectively, prior to the loan and the facility being considered impaired. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint ventures was $0 and $10,137,863, respectively, and our total investment in the joint ventures was $0 and $2,324,885, respectively.\nOn September 16, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $11,000,000 to Cenveo Corporation ( Cenveo\u201d). The loan bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), subject to a 1% floor, plus 11.0% per year, and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in specific equipment used to produce, print, fold, and package printed commercial envelopes. On October 31, 2013, we borrowed $7,150,000 of non-recourse long-term debt from NXT Capital, LLC ( NXT\u201d) secured by our interest in the loan to and collateral from Cenveo. The non-recourse long-term debt was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 6.5% per year. On July 7, 2014, Cenveo made a partial prepayment of $1,111,912 in connection with the loan, which included a net prepayment fee of $11,912. Simultaneously, we partially paid down our non-recourse long-term debt with NXT by making a payment of $702,915. On September 30, 2015, Cenveo satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $6,936,875, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $132,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. As a result of the prepayment by Cenveo, we satisfied our non-recourse long-term debt obligations with NXT by making a prepayment of $4,223,432.\nOn November 26, 2013, we, Fund Fifteen and a third-party creditor made a superpriority, secured term loan in the amount of $30,000,000 to Green Field Energy Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Green Field\u201d), of which our share was $7,500,000. The loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 10% per year and was scheduled to mature on August 26, 2014. The loan was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On March 18, 2014, Green Field satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $7,458,047, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\nOn June 17, 2014, we and Fund Fourteen entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with SeaChange Projects LLC ( SeaChange\u201d) to provide a credit facility of up to $7,000,000, of which our commitment was $6,300,000. On June 20, 2014 and August 20, 2014, we funded $4,050,000 and $2,250,000, respectively. The facility was used to partially finance SeaChange's acquisition and conversion of a containership vessel to meet certain time charter specifications of the Military Sealift Command of the Department of the United States Navy. The facility bore interest at 13.25% per year and was scheduled to mature on February 15, 2018. The facility was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in and earnings from the vessel and the equity interests of SeaChange. Due to SeaChange's inability to meet certain requirements of the Department of the United States Navy, which resulted in the cancellation of the time charter, SeaChange was required to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest under the facility in accordance with the loan agreement. On September 24, 2014, SeaChange satisfied its obligations by making a prepayment of $6,475,894, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest.\nOn July 14, 2014, we, Fund Fourteen and Fund Fifteen (collectively, ICON\u201d) entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA to provide a credit facility of up to $29,000,000 (the ICON Loan\u201d), of which our commitment of $21,750,000 was funded on August 27, 2014 (the TMA Initial Closing Date\u201d). The facility was used by TMA to acquire and refinance two platform supply vessels. At inception, the loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 17%. Upon the acceptance of both vessels by TMA's sub-charterer on September 19, 2014, the margin was reduced to 13%. On November 24, 2014, ICON entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA pursuant to which an unaffiliated third party agreed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of up to $89,000,000 (the Senior Loan\u201d, and collectively with the ICON Loan, the TMA Facility\u201d) to acquire two additional vessels. The TMA Facility has a term of five years from the TMA Initial Closing Date. As a result of the amendment, the margin for the ICON Loan increased to 15% and repayment of the ICON Loan became subordinated to the repayment of the Senior Loan. The TMA Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in the four vessels and TMA's right to the collection of hire with respect to earnings from the sub-charterer related to the four vessels. As of December 31, 2016, our share of the collateral value, net of the balance of the Senior Loan, was estimated to be approximately $4,800,000. The amendment qualified as a new loan under U.S. GAAP and therefore, we wrote off the initial direct costs and deferred revenue associated with the ICON Loan of $674,014 as a charge against finance income. As a condition to the amendment and increased size of the TMA Facility, TMA was required to cause all four platform supply vessels to be under contract by March 31, 2015. Due to TMA's failure to meet such condition, TMA has been in technical default and in payment default while available cash has been swept by the senior lender and applied to the Senior Loan in accordance with the loan agreement. As a result, the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. In January 2016, the remaining two previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. Based on, among other things, TMA's payment history and estimated collateral value as of December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due. Interest on the ICON Loan is currently being accrued.\nOn September 24, 2014, we, Fund Fourteen, Fund Fifteen and Fund Sixteen entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with Premier Trailer Leasing, Inc. (\"Premier Trailer\") to provide a credit facility of up to $20,000,000, of which our commitment of $10,000,000 was funded on such date. The loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 9% per year, and was for a period of six years. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of Premier Trailer's assets, including, without limitation, its fleet of trailers, and the equity interests of Premier Trailer. On August 9, 2016, Premier Trailer satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $10,327,777, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $200,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn November 13, 2014, we and Fund Fourteen made secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $15,000,000 to NARL Marketing Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NARL\u201d) as a part of a $30,000,000 senior secured term loan credit facility, of which our commitment was $12,000,000. The loan bore interest at 10.75% per year and was for a period of three years. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in all of NARL's existing and thereafter acquired assets including, but not limited to, its retail and wholesale fuel equipment, including pumps and storage tanks, and a mortgage on certain real properties. On May 7, 2015, NARL made a partial prepayment on the loan of $827,333 pursuant to the excess cash sweep provision of the loan agreement. On July 15, 2015, NARL made a voluntary partial prepayment on the loan of $6,296,859, which included a prepayment fee of $270,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. On August 6, 2015, NARL satisfied its obligations in full by making a prepayment of $4,319,854 pursuant to the excess cash sweep provision of the loan agreement, comprised of all outstanding principal and unpaid interest.\nAcquisition Fees\nWe did not enter into any new transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with the transactions that we entered into during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid acquisition fees to our Managing Trustee of $0 and $3,884,750, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. We adopted ASU 2014-15 on December 31, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. We adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 as of March 31, 2016. Consequently, we reclassified $610,405 of debt issuance costs from other non-current assets to non-recourse long-term debt, less current portion on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which resulted in the following adjustments:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Adjusted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,679,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,068,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recourse long-term debt, less current portion\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,843,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,233,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), requiring revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for goods and services. This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. Our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements is ongoing and our implementation efforts have included the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance and the evaluation of applicable revenue contracts. We continue to evaluate the timing of recognition of various revenue; however, since a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized from our leasing contracts, which is subject to ASU 2016-02 (as defined below), such revenue is excluded from our evaluation of ASU 2014-09.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07\u201d), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of credit losses by eliminating the probable initial recognition threshold set forth in current guidance, and instead reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation ( ASU 2016-17\u201d), which amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in such entity held by related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. Under ASU 2016-17, a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held by related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. The adoption of ASU 2016-17 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, we are required to apply the amendments within ASU 2016-17 retrospectively to when we initially applied the amendments within ASU 2015-02. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-17 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows ( ASU 2016-18\u201d), which provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-18 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which clarifies the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 sets forth requirements to be met for a set to be deemed a business and establishes a practical way to determine when a set is not a business. To be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output, and removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. In addition, ASU 2017-01 narrows the definition of outputs and aligns such definition with how outputs are described within the revenue guidance. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for transactions that occur before the issuance date or effective date of ASU 2017-01 to the extent that such transactions have not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our Managing Trustee to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lease classification and revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Asset impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Depreciation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Notes receivable and revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Derivative financial instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease Classification and Revenue Recognition\nEach equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.\nOur Managing Trustee has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the estimated residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.\nThe residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.\nFor finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease, less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.\nAsset Impairments\nThe significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income in the period the determination is made.\nThe events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying asset is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset and, if applicable, the remaining obligation to the non-recourse lender. Generally in the latter situation, the residual position relates to equipment subject to third-party non-recourse debt where the lessee remits its rental payments directly to the lender and we do not recover our residual position until the non-recourse debt is repaid in full. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Managing Trustee's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.\nDepreciation\nWe record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease or vessel. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNotes Receivable and Revenue Recognition\nNotes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate the loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Our notes receivable may contain a paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision. Any PIK interest, if deemed collectible, will be added to the principal balance of the note receivable and is recorded as finance income.\nCredit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve\nOur Managing Trustee monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower's financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower's compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower's payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Managing Trustee may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower's facility and meet with a borrower's management to better understand such borrower's financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.\nAs our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Managing Trustee is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Managing Trustee does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Managing Trustee then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.\nFinancing receivables are generally placed on a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Managing Trustee periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Managing Trustee's judgment, these accounts may be placed on a non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables on non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.\nWhen our Managing Trustee deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe entered into derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We entered into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for warrants, which are not hedges. Certain derivatives did not meet the established criteria to be designated as qualifying accounting hedges, even though we believed that these were effective economic hedges.\nWe recognized all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and measured those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments were recognized immediately in earnings unless certain criteria were met. These criteria demonstrated that the derivative was expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and included an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the derivative. If these criteria were met, which we documented and assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis, we recognized the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI\u201d), a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of all derivatives were recognized immediately in earnings.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) and 2015 ( 2015\u201d)\nThe following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods. Further, these percentages are only representative of the percentage of the carrying value of such assets, finance income or rental income as of each stated period, and as such are not indicative of the concentration of any asset type or customer by the amount of equity invested or our investment portfolio as a whole.\nFinancing Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of assets securing the financing transactions in our portfolio:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tanker vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,597,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,760,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform supply vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,002,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,002,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,273,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,935,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trailers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,842,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,515,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lubricant manufacturing equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,668,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,874,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,725,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our financing transactions includes the balance of our net investment in notes receivable and our net investment in finance leases as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Finance Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>T\u00e9cnicas Maritimas Avanzadas, S.A. de C.V.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Platform supply vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreguard Shipping I Global Ships Ltd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tanker vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Blackhawk Mining, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>D&T Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income and prepayment fees from our net investment in notes receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance leases are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNon-performing Assets within Financing Transactions\nDuring 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss on our loan related to VAS of $697,384 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOn May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during 2015. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. During 2015, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis). No gain or loss was recognized during 2015 as a result of the sale of leased equipment (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases and charters in our portfolio:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore oil field services equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,518,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,964,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,042,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,778,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,720,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,561,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,463,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost, vessels and asset held for sale as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total rental income as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pacific Crest Pte.

On July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. During 2016, we obtained third-party appraisals indicating that the fair market value of the barge decreased below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed impairment analyses and recorded an aggregate impairment loss of $8,323,643 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As Swiber Offshore is in default of its obligations under the charter and the then current fair market value of the barge was less than $21,000,000, our Managing Trustee concluded that Swiber's rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return pursuant to the joint venture's operating agreement. As a result, the aggregate impairment loss was allocated entirely to Swiber, the noncontrolling interest holder.\nOn November 28, 2016, Swiber Offshore filed an application for voluntary winding up and liquidation. Subsequently, our Managing Trustee has engaged in discussions with the court-appointed judicial manager of Swiber Holdings to, among other things, communicate our intention to sell the barge. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee commenced the process of marketing the barge for sale and it is currently engaged in negotiations with several interested parties. As of December 31, 2016, the barge met the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $7,170,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to write down the barge to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of $7,600,000. Swiber was only allocated $383,329 of such additional impairment loss because the balance of its noncontrolling interest in the joint venture had been reduced to zero. As a result, the remaining additional impairment loss of $6,786,671 was allocated to us during the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying value of the barge was $7,600,000 and $24,528,856, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we recognized rental income of $3,652,500 and $7,305,000, respectively (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nDuring 2015, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader based on impairment analyses performed by our Managing Trustee, which concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. As of December 31, 2015, the net carrying value of such vessels was $5,720,000. In September 2016, the vessels were sold to unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate gross purchase price of $6,200,000. After deducting selling costs of $353,444, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of $303,943 during 2016.

The increase was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in loss from investment in joint ventures due to a lower credit loss recorded by the\njoint ventures related to JAC during 2016 as compared to 2015, (ii) a gain on sale of investment in joint venture as a result of the sale of our interests in ICON AET during 2016 and (iii) a gain on sale of vessels as a result of the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016. The increase was partially offset by decreases in (a) rental income due to no income recognition related to Swiber Offshore as collectability of monthly charter payments has been in doubt since July 2016, (b) finance income primarily due to several prepayments by our borrowers and lessees during 2015 and (c) time charter revenue due to the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader in September 2016, and lower charter rates related to such vessels during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nExpenses for 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,404,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(459,695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expense reimbursements\n</td> <td>1,214,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,744,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529,285\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>2,516,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,692,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(176,837\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>3,374,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,009,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(634,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>5,865,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,405,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,539,427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,848,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,848,978\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss\n</td> <td>15,493,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,149,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,344,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel operating\n</td> <td>3,278,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,402,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,124,763\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement expense\n</td> <td>1,209,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,209,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,897,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,657,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,760,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses for 2016 decreased $4,760,530, or 12.3%, as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) the credit losses related to Patriot Coal and VAS that were recorded during 2015, of which there were no corresponding losses recorded during 2016, (ii) lower depreciation recorded related to the Swiber Chateau, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader as such vessels were either no longer in operation or reclassified to assets held for sale at June 30, 2016, resulting in no further depreciation being recorded on such vessels, (iii) lower vessel operating expenses due to the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016 compared to a full year of vessel operating expenses during 2015 and (iv) lower interest expense as a result of scheduled repayments on our non-recourse long-term debt, and satisfying our non-recourse long-term debt related to Cenveo resulting from its prepayment during 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in impairment loss due to the impairment loss recorded in 2016 related to the Swiber Chateau, which was higher than the impairment loss recorded during 2015 related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader, and our share of the litigation settlement payment related to ICON EAR that was recorded in 2016.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests changed by $9,976,933, from net income of $4,181,980 in 2015 to a net loss of $5,794,953 in 2016. The change was primarily due to the allocation of a portion of the impairment loss related to the Swiber Chateau to Swiber during 2016.\nNet Loss Attributable to Fund Twelve Liquidating Trust\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net loss attributable to us for 2016 and 2015 was $3,689,159 and $21,713,695, respectively.

within Financing Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our impaired loan related to VAS was $966,359. The loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss of $697,384 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss was $197,741 in 2014 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOn May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during 2015. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis) and $46,057, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized during 2015 as a result of the sale of leased equipment (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases and charters in our portfolio:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore oil field services equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,964,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,356,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,720,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,266,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,778,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,395,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,463,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,018,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost and vessels as of each reporting date.\nImpaired Assets within Operating Lease Transactions\nDuring 2015, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader based on impairment analyses performed by our Managing Trustee, which concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in time charter revenue related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader as we commenced operating such vessels in April 2014.\nExpenses for 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,404,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,918,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(513,751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expense reimbursements\n</td> <td>1,744,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,785,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,041,198\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>2,692,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,066,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(373,933\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>4,009,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,289,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,279,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>8,405,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,127,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,277,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss, net\n</td> <td>4,848,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,214,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss\n</td> <td>11,149,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,079,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel operating\n</td> <td>4,402,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,334,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on derivative financial instruments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,657,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,599,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,058,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses for 2015 increased $11,058,485, or 40.1%, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) impairment losses recorded related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2015, (ii) the credit loss recorded related to Patriot Coal during 2015 and (iii) an increase in depreciation expense due to entering into two new operating leases during 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expense reimbursements primarily due to costs incurred on our behalf by our Managing Trustee in connection with a proposed sale of our assets during our liquidation period in 2014 and lower costs incurred in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of the decrease in size of our investment portfolio during our liquidation period. These increases were also partially offset by decreases in (a) interest expense primarily as a result of the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt associated with three of the Leighton Vessels that were sold in 2014, (b) general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher legal fees incurred during 2014 related to EAR and other various matters as compared to 2015 and (c) management fees primarily due to the sale of three of the Leighton Vessels in 2014 and prepayments on our financing receivables, which included the sale of our interest in the loans with Ocean Navigation and the prepayment by SAE during 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $401,200, from $3,780,780 in 2014 to $4,181,980 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional consolidated joint ventures that we entered into during 2014.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income decreased $629,587, from $629,587 in 2014 to $0 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the termination or maturity of all our designated interest rate swaps in April 2014, which resulted in the reclassification from AOCI to interest expense and loss on derivative financial instruments during 2014 and (ii) the change in fair value of our designated interest rate swaps during 2014.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Fund Twelve Liquidating Trust\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net (loss) income attributable to us for 2015 and 2014 was $(21,713,695) and $59,880,331, respectively. Net (loss) income attributable to us per weighted average additional Interest outstanding for 2015 and 2014 was $(61.71) and $170.19, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nThis section discusses the major balance sheet variances at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets decreased $57,094,726, from $188,181,529 at December 31, 2015 to $131,086,803 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the use of cash to pay distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests, (ii) the impairment loss recorded related to the Swiber Chateau during 2016, (iii) the use of cash to repay our non-recourse long-term debt and (iv) depreciation recorded during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by gains recognized from the sale of certain of our investments and income generated from our investments during 2016.\nCurrent Assets\nCurrent assets increased $7,028,610, from $22,423,057 at December 31, 2015 to $29,451,667 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily a result of (i) additional accrued interest related to our loan with TMA and (ii) proceeds received from prepayments by Premier Trailer and LSC, as well as from the sale of certain non-current investments during 2016, partially offset by the use of cash to pay distributions to our beneficial owners and to repay our non-recourse long-term debt.\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities decreased $6,287,117, from $62,493,259 at December 31, 2015 to $56,206,142 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt and the payment of certain accrued liabilities during 2016.\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent liabilities increased $20,825,508, from $8,362,050 at December 31, 2015 to $29,187,558 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) the event of default on the non-recourse long-term debt related to the EPIC Vessels, which resulted in the reclassification of the outstanding balance of such debt to current liabilities, and (ii) the seller's credit that was due to Swiber in March 2017.\nEquity\nEquity decreased $50,807,609, from $125,688,270 at December 31, 2015 to $74,880,661 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests and our net loss during 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10,255,053 and $8,404,092, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.5% of the gross offering proceeds. As of December 31, 2016, the cash reserve was $1,738,435. During our liquidation period, which commenced on May 1, 2014, we expect our main sources of cash will be from the collection of income and principal on our notes receivable and finance leases and proceeds from the sale of assets held directly by us or indirectly by our joint ventures and our main use of cash will be for distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from investments and proceeds from the sale of our investments exceed expenses and decreasing as we meet our debt obligations, pay distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments.\nWe anticipate being able to meet our liquidity requirements into the foreseeable future through the expected results of our operating activities, as well as cash received from our investments at maturity. However, our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our lessees' and borrowers' businesses that are beyond our control.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $7,250,286, from $26,170,007 in 2015 to $18,919,721 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to less cash receipts from operations in 2016 as compared to 2015 and a decrease in the collection of finance income as a result of the termination of a finance lease, partially offset by less cash being used to settle the amount due to our Managing Trustee during 2016 as a result of a reduction in expenses paid on our behalf by our Managing Trustee since 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities increased $4,855,276, from $25,629,739 in 2015 to $30,485,015 in 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our interests in ICON AET and from the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016, partially offset by a decrease in principal received on notes receivable due to several prepayments during 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities decreased $11,252,442, from $58,806,217 in 2015 to $47,553,775 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the prepayment of our non-recourse long-term debt associated with Cenveo during 2015 as a result of the prepayment of a secured term loan by Cenveo and a decrease in distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nFinancings and Borrowings\nNon-Recourse Long-Term Debt\nWe had non-recourse long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $41,361,582 and $47,439,115, respectively. All of our non-recourse long-term debt obligations consist of notes payable in which the lender has a security interest in the underlying assets. If the borrower were to default on the underlying lease, resulting in our default on the non-recourse long-term debt, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of that debt. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total carrying value of assets subject to non-recourse long-term debt was $79,790,314 and $87,131,546, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our non-recourse long-term debt.\nRevolving Line of Credit, Recourse\nWe entered into an agreement with California Bank & Trust ( CB&T\u201d) for a revolving line of credit through March 31, 2015 of up to $10,000,000 (the Facility\u201d), which was secured by all of our assets not subject to a first priority lien. Amounts available under the Facility were subject to a borrowing base that was determined, subject to certain limitations, by the present value of future receivables under certain loans and lease agreements in which we had a beneficial interest.\nThe interest rate for general advances under the Facility was CB&T's prime rate. We could have elected to designate up to five advances on the outstanding principal balance of the Facility to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% per year. In all instances, borrowings under the Facility were subject to an interest rate floor of 4.0% per year. In addition, we were obligated to pay an annualized 0.50% fee on unused commitments under the Facility. On February 28, 2014 and March 31, 2014, we drew down $3,000,000 and $7,000,000, respectively, under the Facility. On November 6, 2014, we repaid the $10,000,000.\nOn December 22, 2014, the Facility with CB&T was terminated. There were no obligations outstanding as of the date of termination.\nDistributions\nWe, at our Managing Trustee's discretion, paid monthly distributions to each of our beneficial owners beginning with the first month after each such beneficial owner's admission to the LLC through the end of our operating period, which was April 30, 2014. Distributions paid through the Liquidating Trust will vary, depending on the timing of the sale of our assets and/or the maturity of our investments, and our receipt of rental, finance and other income from our investments. We paid distributions to our additional beneficial owners of $33,391,113, $37,944,866 and $25,257,603 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our Managing Trustee of $337,284, $383,282 and $255,127 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests of $7,595,100, $9,390,629 and $7,079,452 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Managing Trustee believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligation may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had non-recourse long-term debt and seller's credit. Each lender has a security interest in the majority of the assets collateralizing each non-recourse debt instrument and an assignment of the rental payments under the lease associated with the assets. In such cases, the lender is being paid directly by the lessee. In other cases, we receive the rental payments and pay the lender. If the lessee defaults on the lease, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of the non-recourse debt. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding non-recourse long-term indebtedness and seller's credit totaled $58,319,242.\nPrincipal and interest maturities of our debt, seller's credit and related interest consisted of the following at December 31, 2016:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recourse long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,819,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,721,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,347,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recourse long-term debt interest*\n</td> <td>8,026,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,218,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,473,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,174,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seller's credit\n</td> <td>16,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,345,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,940,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,820,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,924,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,659,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Based on fixed or variable rates in effect at December 31, 2016.\nIn connection with certain debt obligations, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts with certain banks. At December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash of $3,471,147, which is presented within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring 2008, ICON EAR purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for $15,729,500. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Managing Trustee filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ICON EAR sold its only remaining asset consisting of real property for $207,937. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale. Prior to the sale, ICON EAR recognized an impairment charge of $70,412 based on the then estimated fair value less cost to sell the real property.\nGiven the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Managing Trustee engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,209,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nNone.\nInflation and Interest Rates\nThe potential effects of inflation on us are difficult to predict. If the general economy experiences significant rates of inflation, however, it could affect us in a number of ways. We do not currently have or expect to have rent escalation clauses tied to inflation in our leases and most of our notes receivable contain fixed interest rates. The anticipated residual values to be realized upon the sale or re-lease of equipment upon lease termination (and thus the overall cash flow from our leases) may increase with inflation as the cost of similar new and used equipment increases.\nIf interest rates increase or decrease significantly, our leases and notes receivable already in place would generally not be affected.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Managing Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Managing Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions, including, among other things, factors discussed in Part I. Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our beneficial owners invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third-party end users or financed equipment for third parties and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. Some of our equipment leases were acquired for cash and were expected to provide current cash flow, which we refer to as income\u201d leases. For our other equipment leases, we financed the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties. We refer to these leases as growth\u201d leases. These growth leases generated little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments we received from the lessee were used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease. For these leases, we anticipated that the future value of the leased equipment would exceed our cash portion of the purchase price.\nOur Managing Trustee manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, under the terms of our Trust Agreement.\nOur offering period ended on April 30, 2009 and our operating period commenced on May 1, 2009. During our offering period, we raised total equity of $347,686,947. Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014 and our liquidation period commenced on May 1, 2014. During our liquidation period, we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Liquidating Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement that appointed our Manager as Managing Trustee of the Liquidating Trust. Prior to the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the LLC to the Liquidating Trust, the LLC's assets included investments in ICON Radiance, LLC, ICON Siva, LLC, ICON Victorious, LLC, ICON Mauritius MI, LLC, ICON Mauritius MI II, LLC, ICON Blackhawk, LLC, ICON Murray VII, LLC and a subordinated term loan to TMA. These investments, as well as all other assets and liabilities of the LLC, were transferred to the Liquidating Trust from the LLC on December 31, 2016 in order to reduce expenses and to maximize potential distributions to beneficial owners of the Liquidating Trust. On December 31, 2016, all Shares were exchanged for an equal number of Interests in the Liquidating Trust.\nThe financial position and results of operations of the LLC are presented as those of the Liquidating Trust retroactively to the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nCurrent Business Environment\nRecent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.\nOur Managing Trustee is cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy's recovery will continue throughout 2017 and into 2018. An overall improvement in the unemployment rate, which was 4.7% as of December 31, 2016, as well as price increases in energy and other commodities, have resulted in stock market gains and an increase in loan prices. However, continued increases in the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on net exports and energy and other commodity prices.\nThe equipment financing industry has encountered significant challenges over the past several years, as a result of, among other things, an unprecedented and prolonged weakness in global shipping and offshore markets. These challenges, among other factors, have caused us to record credit losses and/or impairment charges on certain of our investments (see Significant Transactions\u201d below).\nSignificant Transactions\nWe engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTelecommunications Equipment\nFrom July 15, 2010 through March 31, 2011, we purchased telecommunications equipment for $5,025,434 and simultaneously leased the equipment to Broadview Networks Holdings, Inc. and Broadview Networks Inc. (collectively, Broadview\u201d). The base term of the four leases was for a period of 36 months, which commenced between August 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011. On August 22, 2012, Broadview commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. On November 14, 2012, Broadview completed a prepackaged restructuring, emerged from bankruptcy and affirmed all of our leases. During the year ended December 31, 2013, upon the expiration of three leases, Broadview purchased telecommunications equipment subject to the leases from us for an aggregate purchase price of $460,725. On March 31, 2014, upon the expiration of the fourth lease, Broadview purchased telecommunications equipment subject to the lease from us for $293,090. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of these sales.\nCoal Drag Line\nOn July 9, 2012, Patriot Coal Corporation ( Patriot Coal\u201d) and substantially all of its subsidiaries, including Magnum Coal Company, LLC ( Magnum\u201d), commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. On March 11, 2013, we amended our lease with Magnum to expire on August 1, 2015. The terms of the amendment resulted in the reclassification of the lease from an operating lease to a finance lease. On May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease prior to its expiration date and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. After obtaining the bankruptcy court's approval, our bankruptcy claim against Patriot Coal was strengthened from an unsecured claim to an administrative claim. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis) and $46,057, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale of leased equipment.\nMarine Vessels and Equipment\nDuring 2009, we purchased three barges, the Leighton Mynx, the Leighton Stealth and the Leighton Eclipse, and a pipelay barge, the Leighton Faulkner (collectively, the Leighton Vessels\u201d), and simultaneously leased the Leighton Vessels to an affiliate of Leighton Offshore Pte. Ltd. ( Leighton\u201d) for a period of 96 months that were scheduled to expire between June 2017 and January 2018.\nOn May 16, 2013, Leighton provided notice to us that it was exercising its purchase options on the Leighton Vessels. On August 23, 2013, Leighton, in accordance with the terms of a bareboat charter scheduled to expire on June 25, 2017, exercised its option to purchase the Leighton Mynx from us for $25,832,445, including payment of swap-related expenses of $254,719. In addition, Leighton paid all break costs and legal fees incurred by us with respect to the sale of the Leighton Mynx. As a result of the termination of the lease and the sale of the vessel, we recognized additional finance income of $562,411. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Leighton Mynx were used to repay Leighton's seller's credits of $7,335,000 related to our original purchase of the barge as well as to satisfy third-party non-recourse debts related to the barge by making a payment of $13,290,982. As part of the repayment, the interest rate swaps related to the debts were terminated and a loss on derivative financial instruments of $210,779 was recognized. On April 3, 2014, Leighton, in accordance with the terms of three bareboat charters scheduled to expire between 2017 and 2018, exercised its options and purchased the three remaining Leighton Vessels from us for an aggregate price of $155,220,900, including payment of swap-related expenses of $720,900. As a result of the termination of the leases and the sale of the three remaining Leighton Vessels, we recognized additional finance income of $57,248,440. A portion of the aggregate purchase price due from the exercise of the purchase options was used to satisfy the Leighton seller's credits of $47,421,000 related to our original purchase of the three Leighton Vessels as well as to satisfy our non-recourse debt obligations with Standard Chartered of $38,425,536.\nOn June 25, 2009, we purchased marine diving equipment from Swiber Engineering Ltd. ( Swiber\u201d) for $10,000,000. Simultaneously, we entered into a 60-month lease with Swiber, which commenced on July 1, 2009. Subsequent to the expiration of the lease, on November 14, 2014, we sold the diving equipment to a subsidiary of Swiber Holdings Limited ( Swiber Holdings\u201d) for $4,000,000 net, after deducting the $2,000,000 seller's credit owed to Swiber.\nOn March 24, 2009, we and Swiber entered into a joint venture owned 51% by us and 49% by Swiber for the purpose of purchasing a 300-man accommodation and work barge, the Swiber Chateau (f/k/a the Swiber Victorious). Simultaneously with the purchase, the barge was chartered to Swiber Offshore Marine Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of Swiber ( Swiber Offshore\u201d), for 96 months, which expired on March 23, 2017. The Swiber Chateau was purchased for $42,500,000, which was funded by (i) a $19,125,000 equity investment from us, (ii) an $18,375,000 contribution-in-kind by Swiber and (iii) a $5,000,000 subordinated, non-recourse and unsecured payable from Swiber. The payable bore interest at 3.5% per year and is recorded within seller's credits on our consolidated balance sheets. If a default occurs under the charter, the joint venture will not be required to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable. Swiber Holdings, the parent company of Swiber and Swiber Offshore (together with Swiber and Swiber Offshore, the Swiber Group\u201d), guarantees the payment and performance obligations of Swiber Offshore and its affiliates under all transaction documents.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2016, we obtained a third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the barge as of June 27, 2016 was $17,875,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed an impairment test on the barge. Based on such test, we recorded an impairment loss of $5,218,643 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Swiber Offshore has also failed to make its monthly charter payments to the joint venture since July 2016. Pursuant to the joint venture's operating agreement, in the event that, among other things, (i) there is a default by Swiber Offshore under the charter, or (ii) the fair market value of the barge is less than $21,000,000, all of Swiber's interests in the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds resulting from the joint venture will be subordinate to our rights in such distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds until such time that we have received in distribution the return of the full amount of our contribution to the joint venture and a return at a monthly compounded rate equal to 15.51% per year. As the then current fair market value of the barge was less than $21,000,000, our Managing Trustee concluded that, commencing June 27, 2016, Swiber's rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return described above. Accordingly, the impairment loss recorded as of June 30, 2016 of $5,218,643 was allocated entirely to Swiber, the noncontrolling interest holder. As a result, the impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nOn July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. In November 2016, we obtained an updated third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the barge decreased to $14,770,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment loss of $3,105,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was allocated entirely to Swiber. The impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the three months ended September 30, 2016.\nOn November 28, 2016, Swiber Offshore filed an application for voluntary winding up and liquidation. Subsequently, our Managing Trustee has engaged in discussions with the court-appointed judicial manager of Swiber Holdings to, among other things, communicate our intention to sell the barge. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee commenced the process of marketing the barge for sale and it is currently engaged in negotiations with several interested parties. As of December 31, 2016, the barge met the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $7,170,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to write down the barge to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of $7,600,000. Swiber was only allocated $383,329 of such additional impairment loss because the balance of its noncontrolling interest in the joint venture had been reduced to zero. As a result, the remaining additional impairment loss of $6,786,671 was allocated to us during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Upon expiration of the charter on March 23, 2017, the joint venture's obligation to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable of $5,000,000 was extinguished pursuant to the purchase and charter agreement due to, among other things, Swiber Offshore's existing defaults on the charter. A gain of $5,000,000 from the extinguishment of the payable will be allocated entirely to us during the three months ending March 31, 2017.\nOn March 29, 2011, we and ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, entered into a joint venture, ICON AET Holdings, LLC (\"ICON AET\"), which was owned 25% by us and 75% by Fund Fourteen, for the purpose of acquiring two aframax tankers and two very large crude carriers (the \"VLCCs\", and collectively with the aframax tankers, the \"AET Vessels\"). Our contribution to the joint venture was $12,166,393. The aframax tankers, the Eagle Otome and the Eagle Subaru, were each acquired for $13,000,000 and were simultaneously bareboat chartered to AET Inc. Limited ( AET\u201d) for a period of three years. The VLCCs, the Eagle Vermont and the Eagle Virginia, were each acquired for $72,000,000 and were simultaneously bareboat chartered to AET for a period of 10 years. On April 14, 2014 and May 21, 2014, upon expiration of the leases with AET, ICON AET sold the aframax tankers to third-party purchasers for an aggregate price of $14,821,890. As a result, ICON AET recognized an aggregate gain on sale of assets of $2,229,932. Our share of such gain was $557,483, which is included within income from investment in joint ventures on our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. On June 8, 2016, an unaffiliated third party purchased 100% of the limited liability company interests of ICON AET for net sales proceeds of $48,798,058. As a result, we recorded a gain on sale of investment in joint venture of $2,012,669.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader (f/k/a the Arabian Express) were returned to us in accordance with the terms of the charters. Upon redelivery, the bareboat charters were terminated and we assumed the underlying time charters for the vessels. As we assumed operational responsibility of the vessels, we simultaneously contracted with Fleet Ship Management Inc. to manage the vessels on our behalf. Accordingly, these vessels were reclassified to Vessels on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, based on (i) the upcoming time charter expirations with no expectation that such charters would be renewed or timely replaced with new longer-term charter agreements and (ii) then current low time charter rates in the market, our Managing Trustee performed impairment analyses and concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. Our Managing Trustee estimated the fair market values of the vessels based on third-party valuations using a sales comparison approach. Based upon our Managing Trustee's assessment, the net book values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader exceeded their estimated undiscounted cash flows and their fair values and, as a result, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale and no further depreciation was recorded on the vessels. In September 2016, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were sold to unaffiliated third parties for a gross purchase price of $3,000,000 and $3,200,000, respectively. After deducting selling costs of $353,444, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of $303,943 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn March 21, 2014, a joint venture owned 75% by us, 12.5% by Fund Fourteen and 12.5% by ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P. ( Fund Fifteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, through two indirect subsidiaries, entered into memoranda of agreement to purchase the EPIC Vessels from Foreguard Shipping I Global Ships Ltd. (f/k/a Siva Global Ships Limited) ( Foreguard Shipping\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of $41,600,000. The EPIC Bali and the EPIC Borneo were delivered on March 28, 2014 and April 8, 2014, respectively. The EPIC Vessels were bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Foreguard Shipping for a period of eight years upon the delivery of each respective vessel. The EPIC Vessels were each acquired for approximately $3,550,000 in cash, $12,400,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB Group Merchant Bank (Asia) Ltd. ( DVB\u201d) and $4,750,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.\nOn June 12, 2014, a joint venture owned 75% by us, 12.5% by Fund Fourteen and 12.5% by Fund Fifteen purchased an offshore supply vessel from Pacific Crest Pte. Ltd. ( Pacific Crest\u201d) for $40,000,000. Simultaneously, the vessel was bareboat chartered to Pacific Crest for 10 years. The vessel was acquired for approximately $12,000,000 in cash, $26,000,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB and $2,000,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.\nManufacturing Equipment\nDuring 2008, ICON EAR, LLC ( ICON EAR\u201d), a joint venture owned 55% by us and 45% by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven Liquidating Trust (formerly, ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC) (\"Fund Eleven\"), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Equipment Acquisition Resources, Inc. ( EAR\u201d) for $15,729,500. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Managing Trustee filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ICON EAR sold its only remaining asset consisting of real property for $207,937. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale. Prior to the sale, ICON EAR recognized an impairment charge of $70,412 based on the then estimated fair value less cost to sell the real property.\nGiven the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Managing Trustee engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,209,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.\nOn January 4, 2012, MW Universal, Inc. ( MWU\u201d) and certain of its subsidiaries satisfied their obligations relating to two of the three lease schedules. On August 20, 2012, we sold the automotive manufacturing equipment subject to lease with LC Manufacturing, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MWU ( LC Manufacturing\u201d), and terminated warrants issued to us for aggregate proceeds of $8,300,000. As a result, based on our 93.67% ownership interest in ICON MW, LLC ( ICON MW\u201d), our joint venture with Fund Eleven, we received proceeds in the amount of $7,774,610 and recognized a loss on the sale of $88,786. In addition, our Managing Trustee evaluated the collectability of the personal guaranty of a previous owner of LC Manufacturing and, based on the findings, ICON MW recorded a credit loss of $5,411,484, of which our portion was $5,068,937. In February 2013, ICON MW commenced an action against the guarantor. On October 5, 2015, ICON MW received summary judgment against the guarantor on the issue of liability. A hearing to determine damages was held in July 2016. In September 2016, the court referee issued a report recommending a judgment in favor of ICON MW for (i) $5,660,000 in damages; (ii) $120,000 in attorney's fees; and (iii) $540,000 in prejudgment interest. The court confirmed the report and the recommended judgment in January 2017.\nMining Equipment\nOn September 12, 2013, a joint venture owned by us, Fund Eleven and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen ( Fund Sixteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, purchased mining equipment for $15,106,570. The equipment was subject to a 24-month lease with Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Murray\u201d). On December 1, 2013 and February 1, 2014, Fund Sixteen contributed capital of $933,678 and $1,725,517, respectively, to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees. Subsequent to Fund Sixteen's second capital contribution, the joint venture was owned 13.2% by us, 67% by Fund Eleven and 19.8% by Fund Sixteen. As a result, we received corresponding returns of capital. The lease was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2015, but was extended for one month with an additional lease payment of $635,512. On October 29, 2015, Murray purchased the equipment pursuant to the terms of the lease for $2,991,400. As a result, a gain on sale of assets of $448,710 was recognized by the joint venture, of which our share was $59,230. Pursuant to a remarketing agreement with a third party, the joint venture paid an aggregate remarketing fee of $766,466 as part of the transaction.\nOn March 4, 2014, a joint venture owned 60% by us, 15% by Fund Fourteen, 15% by Fund Fifteen and 10% by Fund Sixteen purchased mining equipment from an affiliate of Blackhawk Mining, LLC ( Blackhawk\u201d). Simultaneously, the mining equipment was leased to Blackhawk and its affiliates for four years. The aggregate purchase price for the mining equipment of $25,359,446 was funded by $17,859,446 in cash and $7,500,000 of non-recourse long-term debt with People's Capital and Leasing Corp. ( People's Capital\u201d). The loan bears interest at a rate of 6.5% per year and matures on February 1, 2018. On October 27, 2015, the joint venture amended the lease with Blackhawk to waive Blackhawk's breach of a financial covenant during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in consideration for a partial prepayment of $3,502,514, which included an amendment fee of $75,000. In addition, corresponding amendments were made to certain payment and repurchase provisions of the lease to account for the partial prepayment. On December 8, 2015 and December 7, 2016, the joint venture further amended the lease with Blackhawk to, among other things, add, revise and/or waive Blackhawk's breach of certain financial covenants and received additional amendment fees of $75,000 and $150,000, respectively.\nOn September 18, 2014, a joint venture owned 55.817% by us and 44.183% by Hardwood Partners, LLC ( Hardwood\u201d) purchased mining equipment for $6,789,928. The equipment is subject to a 36-month lease with Murray, which expires on September 30, 2017.\nTrucks and Trailers\nOn March 28, 2014, a joint venture owned 60% by us, 27.5% by Fund Fifteen and 12.5% by Fund Sixteen purchased trucks, trailers and other equipment from subsidiaries of D&T Holdings, LLC ( D&T\u201d) for $12,200,000. Simultaneously, the trucks, trailers and other equipment were leased to D&T and its subsidiaries for 57 months. On September 15, 2014, the lease agreement with D&T was amended to allow D&T to increase its capital expenditure limit. In consideration for agreeing to such increase, lease payments of $1,480,000 that were scheduled to be paid in 2018 were paid by October 31, 2014. In addition, the joint venture received an amendment fee of $100,000, which was to be recognized as finance income throughout the remaining lease term. On January 14, 2016, D&T satisfied its remaining lease obligations by making a prepayment of $8,000,000. In addition, D&T exercised its option to repurchase all assets under the lease for $1, upon which title was transferred. As a result of the prepayment, we recognized finance income of approximately $1,400,000.\nNotes Receivable\nOn June 29, 2009, we and Fund Fourteen entered into a joint venture for the purpose of making secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $20,000,000 to INOVA Rentals Corporation (f/k/a ARAM Rentals Corporation) and INOVA Seismic Rentals Inc. (f/k/a ARAM Seismic Rental Inc.) (collectively, the INOVA Borrowers\u201d), which were scheduled to mature on August 1, 2014. In 2011, we exchanged our 52.09% ownership interest in the joint venture for our proportionate share of the notes receivable owned by the joint venture, which was subsequently deconsolidated and then terminated. The loans bore interest at 15% per year and were secured by a first priority security interest in all analog seismic system equipment owned by the INOVA Borrowers, among other collateral. On January 31, 2014, the INOVA Borrowers satisfied their obligations in connection with the loans by making a prepayment of $1,671,858. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\nOn June 30, 2010, we made two secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $9,600,000, one to Ocean Navigation 5 Co. Ltd. and one to Ocean Navigation 6 Co. Ltd. (collectively, Ocean Navigation\u201d), as part of a $96,000,000 term loan facility. The loans were funded between July 2010 and September 2010 and proceeds from the facility were used by Ocean Navigation to purchase two aframax tanker vessels, the Shah Deniz and the Absheron. The loans bore interest at 15.25% per year and were for a period of six years maturing between July and September 2016. The loans were secured by a second priority security interest in the vessels. On April 15, 2014, we sold all our interest in the loans with Ocean Navigation to Garanti Bank International, N.V. for $9,600,000. As a result, we wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable of $455,420 as a charge against finance income.\nOn February 29, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,000,000 to VAS Aero Services, LLC ( VAS\u201d) as part of a $42,755,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at variable rates ranging between 12% and 14.5% per year and matured on October 6, 2014. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of VAS's assets. During the year ended December 31, 2014, VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the loan as well as the balloon payment due on the maturity date. Our Managing Trustee engaged in discussions with VAS, VAS's owners, the senior creditor and other second lien creditors in order to put in place a viable restructuring or refinancing plan. In December 2014, this specific plan to restructure or refinance fell through. While discussions on other options were still ongoing, our Managing Trustee determined that we should record a credit loss reserve based on an estimated liquidation value of VAS's inventory and accounts receivable. As a result, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss reserve of $631,986 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 based on our pro-rata share of the liquidation value of the collateral. The value of the collateral was based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Managing Trustee making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,665 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB Loan, LLC ( GB\u201d) for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,719 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. In addition, we wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of $1,329,370 during the year ended December 31, 2015. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss reserve was $197,741 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn July 24, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $500,000 to affiliates of Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. (collectively, Frontier\u201d) as part of a $5,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 14% per year and was for a period of 66 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Frontier's saltwater disposal wells and related equipment and a second priority security interest in Frontier's other assets, including real estate, machinery and accounts receivable. On October 11, 2013, Frontier made a partial prepayment of $86,524, which included a prepayment fee of $8,924 that was recognized as additional finance income. On December 30, 2014, we sold all of our interest in the loan to Frontier Expansion and Development, LLC for $375,000. As a result, we recognized a loss and wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable totaling $62,365 as a charge against finance income.\nOn September 10, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $4,080,000 to Superior Tube Company, Inc. and Tubes Holdco Limited (collectively, Superior\u201d) as part of a $17,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12% per year and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Superior's assets, including tube manufacturing and related equipment and a mortgage on real property, and a second priority security interest in Superior's accounts receivable and inventory. On January 30, 2015, Superior satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $4,191,328, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $122,038. As a result, we recognized additional finance income of $50,550.\nOn November 28, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $4,050,000 to SAExploration, Inc., SAExploration Seismic Services (US), LLC and NES, LLC (collectively, SAE\u201d) as part of an $80,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per year and was for a period of 48 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in all existing and thereafter acquired assets, including seismic testing equipment, of SAE and its parent company, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. ( SAE Holdings\u201d), and a pledge of all the equity interests in SAE and SAE Holdings. In addition, we acquired warrants, exercisable until December 5, 2022, to purchase 0.051% of the outstanding common stock of SAE Holdings. On October 31, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement with SAE to amend certain provisions and covenant ratios. As a result of the amendment, we received an amendment fee of $30,687. On July 2, 2014, SAE satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $4,591,523, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and prepayment fees of $449,389. The prepayment fees were recognized as additional finance income. On July 21, 2014, we exercised the warrants and received net cash proceeds of $14,208, which resulted in a loss of $43,126 that was recorded in loss on derivative financial instruments.\nOn February 12, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,700,000 to NTS Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NTS\u201d) as part of a $6,000,000 facility. On March 28, 2013, NTS borrowed $765,000 and on June 27, 2013, NTS drew down the remaining $1,935,000 from the facility. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2017. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in all equipment and assets of NTS. On June 6, 2014, NTS satisfied their obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,701,212, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $102,600. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn April 5, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $3,870,000 to Lubricating Specialties Company ( LSC\u201d) as part of an $18,000,000 facility. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per year and was scheduled to mature on August 1, 2018. The loan was secured by, among other things, a second priority security interest in LSC's liquid storage tanks, blending lines, packaging equipment, accounts receivable and inventory. On December 30, 2016, LSC satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,954,424, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $57,930. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn December 22, 2011, a joint venture owned 25% by us and 75% by Fund Fourteen made a $20,124,000 subordinated term loan to JAC as part of a $171,050,000 term loan facility. Our initial contribution to this joint venture was $6,313,875. On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 21% by us, 39% by Fund Eleven and 40% by Fund Fifteen purchased a portion of a $208,038,290 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered for $28,462,500. Our initial contribution to this joint venture was $6,456,034. The loan and the facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15% per year and mature in January 2021. As a result of JAC's failure to make an expected payment that was due to the joint ventures during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the interest rate payable by JAC under the loan and the facility increased from 12.5% to 15.5%. The loan and the facility are secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex.\nDuring 2015, JAC experienced liquidity constraints as a result of a general economic slow-down in China and India, which led to lower demand from such countries, as well as the price decline of energy and other commodities. As a result, JAC's manufacturing facility ceased operations and JAC was not able to service interest payments under the loan and the facility. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an expected tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers that would have allowed JAC's manufacturing facility to resume operations did not commence as originally anticipated. Accordingly, our Managing Trustee determined that there was doubt regarding the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility. Our Managing Trustee visited JAC's manufacturing facility and engaged in discussions with JAC's other stakeholders to agree upon a restructuring plan. Based upon such discussions, which included a potential conversion of a portion of the loan and the facility to equity and/or a restructuring of the loan and the facility, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures may potentially not be able to recover approximately $13,500,000 to $47,300,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC under the loan and the facility as of June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures recognized a total credit loss of $33,264,710, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome based upon the negotiations at the time. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $7,834,118. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures placed the loan and the facility on non-accrual status and ceased to recognize finance income. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, discussions among the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. Our Managing Trustee reassessed the collectability of the loan and the facility by considering the following factors: (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. Our Managing Trustee also considered the proposed plan of converting a portion of the loan and the facility to equity and/or restructuring the loan and the facility in the event that JAC's stakeholders recommenced discussions. Based upon such reassessment, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures may potentially not be able to recover approximately $41,200,000 to $51,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC under the loan and the facility prior to recording the initial total credit loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the joint ventures recognized an additional total credit loss of $16,856,310, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,856,928.\nIn January 2016, our Managing Trustee engaged in further discussions with JAC's other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC's manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Managing Trustee anticipated that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC's manufacturing facility to recommence operations. Our Managing Trustee updated the collectability analysis under the loan and the facility as of December 31, 2015 and determined that comparable enterprise values derived from EBITDA multiples and trading prices of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries each decreased. In addition, our Managing Trustee considered that, as of December 31, 2015, (i) a tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers did not commence as originally anticipated; (ii) no further discussions occurred between JAC, the joint ventures, the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan and (iii) JAC's manufacturing facility continued to be non-operational. Based upon these factors, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility could result in less of a recovery from its prior estimate. As a result, our Managing Trustee determined to record an additional total credit loss of $10,137,863, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2,319,835. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Managing Trustee believes that the marketability of JAC's manufacturing facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Managing Trustee does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint ventures while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to $55,000,000, to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Managing Trustee determined that the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility was further in doubt. As of June 30, 2016, our Managing Trustee updated its quarterly assessment and also considered the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint ventures' loan and facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Managing Trustee determined that the joint ventures should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the loan and the facility due from JAC as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the joint ventures recorded an additional total credit loss of $10,137,863 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of which our share was $2,319,835. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Receiver formally commenced the process of marketing JAC's manufacturing facility for sale. Our Managing Trustee continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC, the receivership process and the marketing process for sale of the manufacturing facility through regular communications with the Receiver and certain other stakeholders. The joint ventures did not recognize any finance income for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the joint ventures recognized finance income of $2,136,688 and $7,356,011, respectively, prior to the loan and the facility being considered impaired. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint ventures was $0 and $10,137,863, respectively, and our total investment in the joint ventures was $0 and $2,324,885, respectively.\nOn September 16, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $11,000,000 to Cenveo Corporation ( Cenveo\u201d). The loan bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), subject to a 1% floor, plus 11.0% per year, and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in specific equipment used to produce, print, fold, and package printed commercial envelopes. On October 31, 2013, we borrowed $7,150,000 of non-recourse long-term debt from NXT Capital, LLC ( NXT\u201d) secured by our interest in the loan to and collateral from Cenveo. The non-recourse long-term debt was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 6.5% per year. On July 7, 2014, Cenveo made a partial prepayment of $1,111,912 in connection with the loan, which included a net prepayment fee of $11,912. Simultaneously, we partially paid down our non-recourse long-term debt with NXT by making a payment of $702,915. On September 30, 2015, Cenveo satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $6,936,875, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $132,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. As a result of the prepayment by Cenveo, we satisfied our non-recourse long-term debt obligations with NXT by making a prepayment of $4,223,432.\nOn November 26, 2013, we, Fund Fifteen and a third-party creditor made a superpriority, secured term loan in the amount of $30,000,000 to Green Field Energy Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Green Field\u201d), of which our share was $7,500,000. The loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 10% per year and was scheduled to mature on August 26, 2014. The loan was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On March 18, 2014, Green Field satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $7,458,047, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\nOn June 17, 2014, we and Fund Fourteen entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with SeaChange Projects LLC ( SeaChange\u201d) to provide a credit facility of up to $7,000,000, of which our commitment was $6,300,000. On June 20, 2014 and August 20, 2014, we funded $4,050,000 and $2,250,000, respectively. The facility was used to partially finance SeaChange's acquisition and conversion of a containership vessel to meet certain time charter specifications of the Military Sealift Command of the Department of the United States Navy. The facility bore interest at 13.25% per year and was scheduled to mature on February 15, 2018. The facility was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in and earnings from the vessel and the equity interests of SeaChange. Due to SeaChange's inability to meet certain requirements of the Department of the United States Navy, which resulted in the cancellation of the time charter, SeaChange was required to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest under the facility in accordance with the loan agreement. On September 24, 2014, SeaChange satisfied its obligations by making a prepayment of $6,475,894, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest.\nOn July 14, 2014, we, Fund Fourteen and Fund Fifteen (collectively, ICON\u201d) entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA to provide a credit facility of up to $29,000,000 (the ICON Loan\u201d), of which our commitment of $21,750,000 was funded on August 27, 2014 (the TMA Initial Closing Date\u201d). The facility was used by TMA to acquire and refinance two platform supply vessels. At inception, the loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 17%. Upon the acceptance of both vessels by TMA's sub-charterer on September 19, 2014, the margin was reduced to 13%. On November 24, 2014, ICON entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA pursuant to which an unaffiliated third party agreed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of up to $89,000,000 (the Senior Loan\u201d, and collectively with the ICON Loan, the TMA Facility\u201d) to acquire two additional vessels. The TMA Facility has a term of five years from the TMA Initial Closing Date. As a result of the amendment, the margin for the ICON Loan increased to 15% and repayment of the ICON Loan became subordinated to the repayment of the Senior Loan. The TMA Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in the four vessels and TMA's right to the collection of hire with respect to earnings from the sub-charterer related to the four vessels. As of December 31, 2016, our share of the collateral value, net of the balance of the Senior Loan, was estimated to be approximately $4,800,000. The amendment qualified as a new loan under U.S. GAAP and therefore, we wrote off the initial direct costs and deferred revenue associated with the ICON Loan of $674,014 as a charge against finance income. As a condition to the amendment and increased size of the TMA Facility, TMA was required to cause all four platform supply vessels to be under contract by March 31, 2015. Due to TMA's failure to meet such condition, TMA has been in technical default and in payment default while available cash has been swept by the senior lender and applied to the Senior Loan in accordance with the loan agreement. As a result, the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. In January 2016, the remaining two previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. Based on, among other things, TMA's payment history and estimated collateral value as of December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due. Interest on the ICON Loan is currently being accrued.\nOn September 24, 2014, we, Fund Fourteen, Fund Fifteen and Fund Sixteen entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with Premier Trailer Leasing, Inc. (\"Premier Trailer\") to provide a credit facility of up to $20,000,000, of which our commitment of $10,000,000 was funded on such date. The loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 9% per year, and was for a period of six years. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of Premier Trailer's assets, including, without limitation, its fleet of trailers, and the equity interests of Premier Trailer. On August 9, 2016, Premier Trailer satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $10,327,777, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $200,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn November 13, 2014, we and Fund Fourteen made secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $15,000,000 to NARL Marketing Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NARL\u201d) as a part of a $30,000,000 senior secured term loan credit facility, of which our commitment was $12,000,000. The loan bore interest at 10.75% per year and was for a period of three years. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in all of NARL's existing and thereafter acquired assets including, but not limited to, its retail and wholesale fuel equipment, including pumps and storage tanks, and a mortgage on certain real properties. On May 7, 2015, NARL made a partial prepayment on the loan of $827,333 pursuant to the excess cash sweep provision of the loan agreement. On July 15, 2015, NARL made a voluntary partial prepayment on the loan of $6,296,859, which included a prepayment fee of $270,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. On August 6, 2015, NARL satisfied its obligations in full by making a prepayment of $4,319,854 pursuant to the excess cash sweep provision of the loan agreement, comprised of all outstanding principal and unpaid interest.\nAcquisition Fees\nWe did not enter into any new transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with the transactions that we entered into during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid acquisition fees to our Managing Trustee of $0 and $3,884,750, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. We adopted ASU 2014-15 on December 31, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. We adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 as of March 31, 2016. Consequently, we reclassified $610,405 of debt issuance costs from other non-current assets to non-recourse long-term debt, less current portion on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which resulted in the following adjustments:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Adjusted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,679,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,068,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recourse long-term debt, less current portion\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,843,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,233,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), requiring revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for goods and services. This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. Our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements is ongoing and our implementation efforts have included the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance and the evaluation of applicable revenue contracts. We continue to evaluate the timing of recognition of various revenue; however, since a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized from our leasing contracts, which is subject to ASU 2016-02 (as defined below), such revenue is excluded from our evaluation of ASU 2014-09.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07\u201d), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of credit losses by eliminating the probable initial recognition threshold set forth in current guidance, and instead reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation ( ASU 2016-17\u201d), which amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in such entity held by related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. Under ASU 2016-17, a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held by related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. The adoption of ASU 2016-17 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, we are required to apply the amendments within ASU 2016-17 retrospectively to when we initially applied the amendments within ASU 2015-02. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-17 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows ( ASU 2016-18\u201d), which provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-18 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which clarifies the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 sets forth requirements to be met for a set to be deemed a business and establishes a practical way to determine when a set is not a business. To be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output, and removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. In addition, ASU 2017-01 narrows the definition of outputs and aligns such definition with how outputs are described within the revenue guidance. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for transactions that occur before the issuance date or effective date of ASU 2017-01 to the extent that such transactions have not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our Managing Trustee to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:\n \u2022 Lease classification and revenue recognition; \n \u2022 Asset impairments; \n \u2022 Depreciation; \n \u2022 Notes receivable and revenue recognition; \n \u2022 Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; and \n \u2022 Derivative financial instruments. \nLease Classification and Revenue Recognition\nEach equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.\nOur Managing Trustee has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the estimated residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.\nThe residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.\nFor finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease, less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.\nAsset Impairments\nThe significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income in the period the determination is made.\nThe events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying asset is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset and, if applicable, the remaining obligation to the non-recourse lender. Generally in the latter situation, the residual position relates to equipment subject to third-party non-recourse debt where the lessee remits its rental payments directly to the lender and we do not recover our residual position until the non-recourse debt is repaid in full. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Managing Trustee's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.\nDepreciation\nWe record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease or vessel. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNotes Receivable and Revenue Recognition\nNotes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate the loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Our notes receivable may contain a paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision. Any PIK interest, if deemed collectible, will be added to the principal balance of the note receivable and is recorded as finance income.\nCredit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve\nOur Managing Trustee monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower's financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower's compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower's payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Managing Trustee may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower's facility and meet with a borrower's management to better understand such borrower's financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.\nAs our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Managing Trustee is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Managing Trustee does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Managing Trustee then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.\nFinancing receivables are generally placed on a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Managing Trustee periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Managing Trustee's judgment, these accounts may be placed on a non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables on non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.\nWhen our Managing Trustee deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe entered into derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We entered into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for warrants, which are not hedges. Certain derivatives did not meet the established criteria to be designated as qualifying accounting hedges, even though we believed that these were effective economic hedges.\nWe recognized all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and measured those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments were recognized immediately in earnings unless certain criteria were met. These criteria demonstrated that the derivative was expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and included an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the derivative. If these criteria were met, which we documented and assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis, we recognized the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI\u201d), a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of all derivatives were recognized immediately in earnings.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) and 2015 ( 2015\u201d)\nThe following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods. Further, these percentages are only representative of the percentage of the carrying value of such assets, finance income or rental income as of each stated period, and as such are not indicative of the concentration of any asset type or customer by the amount of equity invested or our investment portfolio as a whole.\nFinancing Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of assets securing the financing transactions in our portfolio:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tanker vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,597,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,760,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform supply vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,002,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,002,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,273,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,935,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trailers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,842,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,515,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lubricant manufacturing equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,668,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,874,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,725,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our financing transactions includes the balance of our net investment in notes receivable and our net investment in finance leases as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Finance Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>T\u00e9cnicas Maritimas Avanzadas, S.A. de C.V.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Platform supply vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreguard Shipping I Global Ships Ltd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tanker vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Blackhawk Mining, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>D&T Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income and prepayment fees from our net investment in notes receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance leases are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNon-performing Assets within Financing Transactions\nDuring 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss on our loan related to VAS of $697,384 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOn May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during 2015. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. During 2015, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis). No gain or loss was recognized during 2015 as a result of the sale of leased equipment (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases and charters in our portfolio:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Net Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore oil field services equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,518,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,964,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,042,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,778,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,720,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,561,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,463,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost, vessels and asset held for sale as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total rental income as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pacific Crest Pte.

On July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. During 2016, we obtained third-party appraisals indicating that the fair market value of the barge decreased below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed impairment analyses and recorded an aggregate impairment loss of $8,323,643 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As Swiber Offshore is in default of its obligations under the charter and the then current fair market value of the barge was less than $21,000,000, our Managing Trustee concluded that Swiber's rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return pursuant to the joint venture's operating agreement. As a result, the aggregate impairment loss was allocated entirely to Swiber, the noncontrolling interest holder.\nOn November 28, 2016, Swiber Offshore filed an application for voluntary winding up and liquidation. Subsequently, our Managing Trustee has engaged in discussions with the court-appointed judicial manager of Swiber Holdings to, among other things, communicate our intention to sell the barge. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee commenced the process of marketing the barge for sale and it is currently engaged in negotiations with several interested parties. As of December 31, 2016, the barge met the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $7,170,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to write down the barge to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of $7,600,000. Swiber was only allocated $383,329 of such additional impairment loss because the balance of its noncontrolling interest in the joint venture had been reduced to zero. As a result, the remaining additional impairment loss of $6,786,671 was allocated to us during the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying value of the barge was $7,600,000 and $24,528,856, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we recognized rental income of $3,652,500 and $7,305,000, respectively (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nDuring 2015, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader based on impairment analyses performed by our Managing Trustee, which concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. As of December 31, 2015, the net carrying value of such vessels was $5,720,000. In September 2016, the vessels were sold to unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate gross purchase price of $6,200,000. After deducting selling costs of $353,444, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of $303,943 during 2016.

The increase was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in loss from investment in joint ventures due to a lower credit loss recorded by the\njoint ventures related to JAC during 2016 as compared to 2015, (ii) a gain on sale of investment in joint venture as a result of the sale of our interests in ICON AET during 2016 and (iii) a gain on sale of vessels as a result of the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016. The increase was partially offset by decreases in (a) rental income due to no income recognition related to Swiber Offshore as collectability of monthly charter payments has been in doubt since July 2016, (b) finance income primarily due to several prepayments by our borrowers and lessees during 2015 and (c) time charter revenue due to the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader in September 2016, and lower charter rates related to such vessels during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nExpenses for 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,404,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(459,695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expense reimbursements\n</td> <td>1,214,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,744,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529,285\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>2,516,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,692,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(176,837\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>3,374,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,009,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(634,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>5,865,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,405,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,539,427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,848,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,848,978\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss\n</td> <td>15,493,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,149,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,344,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel operating\n</td> <td>3,278,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,402,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,124,763\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement expense\n</td> <td>1,209,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,209,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,897,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,657,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,760,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses for 2016 decreased $4,760,530, or 12.3%, as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) the credit losses related to Patriot Coal and VAS that were recorded during 2015, of which there were no corresponding losses recorded during 2016, (ii) lower depreciation recorded related to the Swiber Chateau, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader as such vessels were either no longer in operation or reclassified to assets held for sale at June 30, 2016, resulting in no further depreciation being recorded on such vessels, (iii) lower vessel operating expenses due to the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016 compared to a full year of vessel operating expenses during 2015 and (iv) lower interest expense as a result of scheduled repayments on our non-recourse long-term debt, and satisfying our non-recourse long-term debt related to Cenveo resulting from its prepayment during 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in impairment loss due to the impairment loss recorded in 2016 related to the Swiber Chateau, which was higher than the impairment loss recorded during 2015 related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader, and our share of the litigation settlement payment related to ICON EAR that was recorded in 2016.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests changed by $9,976,933, from net income of $4,181,980 in 2015 to a net loss of $5,794,953 in 2016. The change was primarily due to the allocation of a portion of the impairment loss related to the Swiber Chateau to Swiber during 2016.\nNet Loss Attributable to Fund Twelve Liquidating Trust\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net loss attributable to us for 2016 and 2015 was $3,689,159 and $21,713,695, respectively.

within Financing Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our impaired loan related to VAS was $966,359. The loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss of $697,384 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss was $197,741 in 2014 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOn May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during 2015. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis) and $46,057, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized during 2015 as a result of the sale of leased equipment (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases and charters in our portfolio:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore oil field services equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,964,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,356,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,720,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,266,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,778,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,395,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,463,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,018,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost and vessels as of each reporting date.\nImpaired Assets within Operating Lease Transactions\nDuring 2015, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader based on impairment analyses performed by our Managing Trustee, which concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in time charter revenue related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader as we commenced operating such vessels in April 2014.\nExpenses for 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,404,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,918,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(513,751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expense reimbursements\n</td> <td>1,744,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,785,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,041,198\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>2,692,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,066,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(373,933\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>4,009,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,289,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,279,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>8,405,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,127,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,277,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss, net\n</td> <td>4,848,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,214,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss\n</td> <td>11,149,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,079,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel operating\n</td> <td>4,402,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,334,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on derivative financial instruments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,657,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,599,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,058,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses for 2015 increased $11,058,485, or 40.1%, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) impairment losses recorded related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2015, (ii) the credit loss recorded related to Patriot Coal during 2015 and (iii) an increase in depreciation expense due to entering into two new operating leases during 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expense reimbursements primarily due to costs incurred on our behalf by our Managing Trustee in connection with a proposed sale of our assets during our liquidation period in 2014 and lower costs incurred in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of the decrease in size of our investment portfolio during our liquidation period. These increases were also partially offset by decreases in (a) interest expense primarily as a result of the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt associated with three of the Leighton Vessels that were sold in 2014, (b) general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher legal fees incurred during 2014 related to EAR and other various matters as compared to 2015 and (c) management fees primarily due to the sale of three of the Leighton Vessels in 2014 and prepayments on our financing receivables, which included the sale of our interest in the loans with Ocean Navigation and the prepayment by SAE during 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $401,200, from $3,780,780 in 2014 to $4,181,980 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional consolidated joint ventures that we entered into during 2014.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income decreased $629,587, from $629,587 in 2014 to $0 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the termination or maturity of all our designated interest rate swaps in April 2014, which resulted in the reclassification from AOCI to interest expense and loss on derivative financial instruments during 2014 and (ii) the change in fair value of our designated interest rate swaps during 2014.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Fund Twelve Liquidating Trust\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net (loss) income attributable to us for 2015 and 2014 was $(21,713,695) and $59,880,331, respectively. Net (loss) income attributable to us per weighted average additional Interest outstanding for 2015 and 2014 was $(61.71) and $170.19, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nThis section discusses the major balance sheet variances at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets decreased $57,094,726, from $188,181,529 at December 31, 2015 to $131,086,803 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the use of cash to pay distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests, (ii) the impairment loss recorded related to the Swiber Chateau during 2016, (iii) the use of cash to repay our non-recourse long-term debt and (iv) depreciation recorded during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by gains recognized from the sale of certain of our investments and income generated from our investments during 2016.\nCurrent Assets\nCurrent assets increased $7,028,610, from $22,423,057 at December 31, 2015 to $29,451,667 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily a result of (i) additional accrued interest related to our loan with TMA and (ii) proceeds received from prepayments by Premier Trailer and LSC, as well as from the sale of certain non-current investments during 2016, partially offset by the use of cash to pay distributions to our beneficial owners and to repay our non-recourse long-term debt.\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities decreased $6,287,117, from $62,493,259 at December 31, 2015 to $56,206,142 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt and the payment of certain accrued liabilities during 2016.\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent liabilities increased $20,825,508, from $8,362,050 at December 31, 2015 to $29,187,558 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) the event of default on the non-recourse long-term debt related to the EPIC Vessels, which resulted in the reclassification of the outstanding balance of such debt to current liabilities, and (ii) the seller's credit that was due to Swiber in March 2017.\nEquity\nEquity decreased $50,807,609, from $125,688,270 at December 31, 2015 to $74,880,661 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests and our net loss during 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10,255,053 and $8,404,092, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.5% of the gross offering proceeds. As of December 31, 2016, the cash reserve was $1,738,435. During our liquidation period, which commenced on May 1, 2014, we expect our main sources of cash will be from the collection of income and principal on our notes receivable and finance leases and proceeds from the sale of assets held directly by us or indirectly by our joint ventures and our main use of cash will be for distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from investments and proceeds from the sale of our investments exceed expenses and decreasing as we meet our debt obligations, pay distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments.\nWe anticipate being able to meet our liquidity requirements into the foreseeable future through the expected results of our operating activities, as well as cash received from our investments at maturity. However, our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our lessees' and borrowers' businesses that are beyond our control.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $7,250,286, from $26,170,007 in 2015 to $18,919,721 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to less cash receipts from operations in 2016 as compared to 2015 and a decrease in the collection of finance income as a result of the termination of a finance lease, partially offset by less cash being used to settle the amount due to our Managing Trustee during 2016 as a result of a reduction in expenses paid on our behalf by our Managing Trustee since 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities increased $4,855,276, from $25,629,739 in 2015 to $30,485,015 in 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our interests in ICON AET and from the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016, partially offset by a decrease in principal received on notes receivable due to several prepayments during 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities decreased $11,252,442, from $58,806,217 in 2015 to $47,553,775 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the prepayment of our non-recourse long-term debt associated with Cenveo during 2015 as a result of the prepayment of a secured term loan by Cenveo and a decrease in distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nFinancings and Borrowings\nNon-Recourse Long-Term Debt\nWe had non-recourse long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $41,361,582 and $47,439,115, respectively. All of our non-recourse long-term debt obligations consist of notes payable in which the lender has a security interest in the underlying assets. If the borrower were to default on the underlying lease, resulting in our default on the non-recourse long-term debt, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of that debt. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total carrying value of assets subject to non-recourse long-term debt was $79,790,314 and $87,131,546, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our non-recourse long-term debt.\nRevolving Line of Credit, Recourse\nWe entered into an agreement with California Bank & Trust ( CB&T\u201d) for a revolving line of credit through March 31, 2015 of up to $10,000,000 (the Facility\u201d), which was secured by all of our assets not subject to a first priority lien. Amounts available under the Facility were subject to a borrowing base that was determined, subject to certain limitations, by the present value of future receivables under certain loans and lease agreements in which we had a beneficial interest.\nThe interest rate for general advances under the Facility was CB&T's prime rate. We could have elected to designate up to five advances on the outstanding principal balance of the Facility to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% per year. In all instances, borrowings under the Facility were subject to an interest rate floor of 4.0% per year. In addition, we were obligated to pay an annualized 0.50% fee on unused commitments under the Facility. On February 28, 2014 and March 31, 2014, we drew down $3,000,000 and $7,000,000, respectively, under the Facility. On November 6, 2014, we repaid the $10,000,000.\nOn December 22, 2014, the Facility with CB&T was terminated. There were no obligations outstanding as of the date of termination.\nDistributions\nWe, at our Managing Trustee's discretion, paid monthly distributions to each of our beneficial owners beginning with the first month after each such beneficial owner's admission to the LLC through the end of our operating period, which was April 30, 2014. Distributions paid through the Liquidating Trust will vary, depending on the timing of the sale of our assets and/or the maturity of our investments, and our receipt of rental, finance and other income from our investments. We paid distributions to our additional beneficial owners of $33,391,113, $37,944,866 and $25,257,603 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our Managing Trustee of $337,284, $383,282 and $255,127 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests of $7,595,100, $9,390,629 and $7,079,452 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Managing Trustee believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligation may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had non-recourse long-term debt and seller's credit. Each lender has a security interest in the majority of the assets collateralizing each non-recourse debt instrument and an assignment of the rental payments under the lease associated with the assets. In such cases, the lender is being paid directly by the lessee. In other cases, we receive the rental payments and pay the lender. If the lessee defaults on the lease, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of the non-recourse debt. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding non-recourse long-term indebtedness and seller's credit totaled $58,319,242.\nPrincipal and interest maturities of our debt, seller's credit and related interest consisted of the following at December 31, 2016:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recourse long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,819,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,721,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,347,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recourse long-term debt interest*\n</td> <td>8,026,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,218,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,473,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,174,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seller's credit\n</td> <td>16,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,345,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,940,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,820,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,924,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,659,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Based on fixed or variable rates in effect at December 31, 2016.\nIn connection with certain debt obligations, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts with certain banks. At December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash of $3,471,147, which is presented within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring 2008, ICON EAR purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for $15,729,500. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Managing Trustee filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ICON EAR sold its only remaining asset consisting of real property for $207,937. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale. Prior to the sale, ICON EAR recognized an impairment charge of $70,412 based on the then estimated fair value less cost to sell the real property.\nGiven the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Managing Trustee engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,209,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nNone.\nInflation and Interest Rates\nThe potential effects of inflation on us are difficult to predict. If the general economy experiences significant rates of inflation, however, it could affect us in a number of ways. We do not currently have or expect to have rent escalation clauses tied to inflation in our leases and most of our notes receivable contain fixed interest rates. The anticipated residual values to be realized upon the sale or re-lease of equipment upon lease termination (and thus the overall cash flow from our leases) may increase with inflation as the cost of similar new and used equipment increases.\nIf interest rates increase or decrease significantly, our leases and notes receivable already in place would generally not be affected.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Managing Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Managing Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions, including, among other things, factors discussed in Part I. Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our beneficial owners invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third-party end users or financed equipment for third parties and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. Some of our equipment leases were acquired for cash and were expected to provide current cash flow, which we refer to as income\u201d leases. For our other equipment leases, we financed the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties. We refer to these leases as growth\u201d leases. These growth leases generated little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments we received from the lessee were used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease. For these leases, we anticipated that the future value of the leased equipment would exceed our cash portion of the purchase price.\nOur Managing Trustee manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, under the terms of our Trust Agreement.\nOur offering period ended on April 30, 2009 and our operating period commenced on May 1, 2009. During our offering period, we raised total equity of $347,686,947. Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014 and our liquidation period commenced on May 1, 2014. During our liquidation period, we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Liquidating Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement that appointed our Manager as Managing Trustee of the Liquidating Trust. Prior to the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the LLC to the Liquidating Trust, the LLC's assets included investments in ICON Radiance, LLC, ICON Siva, LLC, ICON Victorious, LLC, ICON Mauritius MI, LLC, ICON Mauritius MI II, LLC, ICON Blackhawk, LLC, ICON Murray VII, LLC and a subordinated term loan to TMA. These investments, as well as all other assets and liabilities of the LLC, were transferred to the Liquidating Trust from the LLC on December 31, 2016 in order to reduce expenses and to maximize potential distributions to beneficial owners of the Liquidating Trust. On December 31, 2016, all Shares were exchanged for an equal number of Interests in the Liquidating Trust.\nThe financial position and results of operations of the LLC are presented as those of the Liquidating Trust retroactively to the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nCurrent Business Environment\nRecent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.\nOur Managing Trustee is cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy's recovery will continue throughout 2017 and into 2018. An overall improvement in the unemployment rate, which was 4.7% as of December 31, 2016, as well as price increases in energy and other commodities, have resulted in stock market gains and an increase in loan prices. However, continued increases in the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on net exports and energy and other commodity prices.\nThe equipment financing industry has encountered significant challenges over the past several years, as a result of, among other things, an unprecedented and prolonged weakness in global shipping and offshore markets. These challenges, among other factors, have caused us to record credit losses and/or impairment charges on certain of our investments (see Significant Transactions\u201d below).\nSignificant Transactions\nWe engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTelecommunications Equipment\nFrom July 15, 2010 through March 31, 2011, we purchased telecommunications equipment for $5,025,434 and simultaneously leased the equipment to Broadview Networks Holdings, Inc. and Broadview Networks Inc. (collectively, Broadview\u201d). The base term of the four leases was for a period of 36 months, which commenced between August 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011. On August 22, 2012, Broadview commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. On November 14, 2012, Broadview completed a prepackaged restructuring, emerged from bankruptcy and affirmed all of our leases. During the year ended December 31, 2013, upon the expiration of three leases, Broadview purchased telecommunications equipment subject to the leases from us for an aggregate purchase price of $460,725. On March 31, 2014, upon the expiration of the fourth lease, Broadview purchased telecommunications equipment subject to the lease from us for $293,090. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of these sales.\nCoal Drag Line\nOn July 9, 2012, Patriot Coal Corporation ( Patriot Coal\u201d) and substantially all of its subsidiaries, including Magnum Coal Company, LLC ( Magnum\u201d), commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. On March 11, 2013, we amended our lease with Magnum to expire on August 1, 2015. The terms of the amendment resulted in the reclassification of the lease from an operating lease to a finance lease. On May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease prior to its expiration date and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. After obtaining the bankruptcy court's approval, our bankruptcy claim against Patriot Coal was strengthened from an unsecured claim to an administrative claim. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis) and $46,057, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale of leased equipment.\nMarine Vessels and Equipment\nDuring 2009, we purchased three barges, the Leighton Mynx, the Leighton Stealth and the Leighton Eclipse, and a pipelay barge, the Leighton Faulkner (collectively, the Leighton Vessels\u201d), and simultaneously leased the Leighton Vessels to an affiliate of Leighton Offshore Pte. Ltd. ( Leighton\u201d) for a period of 96 months that were scheduled to expire between June 2017 and January 2018.\nOn May 16, 2013, Leighton provided notice to us that it was exercising its purchase options on the Leighton Vessels. On August 23, 2013, Leighton, in accordance with the terms of a bareboat charter scheduled to expire on June 25, 2017, exercised its option to purchase the Leighton Mynx from us for $25,832,445, including payment of swap-related expenses of $254,719. In addition, Leighton paid all break costs and legal fees incurred by us with respect to the sale of the Leighton Mynx. As a result of the termination of the lease and the sale of the vessel, we recognized additional finance income of $562,411. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Leighton Mynx were used to repay Leighton's seller's credits of $7,335,000 related to our original purchase of the barge as well as to satisfy third-party non-recourse debts related to the barge by making a payment of $13,290,982. As part of the repayment, the interest rate swaps related to the debts were terminated and a loss on derivative financial instruments of $210,779 was recognized. On April 3, 2014, Leighton, in accordance with the terms of three bareboat charters scheduled to expire between 2017 and 2018, exercised its options and purchased the three remaining Leighton Vessels from us for an aggregate price of $155,220,900, including payment of swap-related expenses of $720,900. As a result of the termination of the leases and the sale of the three remaining Leighton Vessels, we recognized additional finance income of $57,248,440. A portion of the aggregate purchase price due from the exercise of the purchase options was used to satisfy the Leighton seller's credits of $47,421,000 related to our original purchase of the three Leighton Vessels as well as to satisfy our non-recourse debt obligations with Standard Chartered of $38,425,536.\nOn June 25, 2009, we purchased marine diving equipment from Swiber Engineering Ltd. ( Swiber\u201d) for $10,000,000. Simultaneously, we entered into a 60-month lease with Swiber, which commenced on July 1, 2009. Subsequent to the expiration of the lease, on November 14, 2014, we sold the diving equipment to a subsidiary of Swiber Holdings Limited ( Swiber Holdings\u201d) for $4,000,000 net, after deducting the $2,000,000 seller's credit owed to Swiber.\nOn March 24, 2009, we and Swiber entered into a joint venture owned 51% by us and 49% by Swiber for the purpose of purchasing a 300-man accommodation and work barge, the Swiber Chateau (f/k/a the Swiber Victorious). Simultaneously with the purchase, the barge was chartered to Swiber Offshore Marine Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of Swiber ( Swiber Offshore\u201d), for 96 months, which expired on March 23, 2017. The Swiber Chateau was purchased for $42,500,000, which was funded by (i) a $19,125,000 equity investment from us, (ii) an $18,375,000 contribution-in-kind by Swiber and (iii) a $5,000,000 subordinated, non-recourse and unsecured payable from Swiber. The payable bore interest at 3.5% per year and is recorded within seller's credits on our consolidated balance sheets. If a default occurs under the charter, the joint venture will not be required to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable. Swiber Holdings, the parent company of Swiber and Swiber Offshore (together with Swiber and Swiber Offshore, the Swiber Group\u201d), guarantees the payment and performance obligations of Swiber Offshore and its affiliates under all transaction documents.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2016, we obtained a third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the barge as of June 27, 2016 was $17,875,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed an impairment test on the barge. Based on such test, we recorded an impairment loss of $5,218,643 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Swiber Offshore has also failed to make its monthly charter payments to the joint venture since July 2016. Pursuant to the joint venture's operating agreement, in the event that, among other things, (i) there is a default by Swiber Offshore under the charter, or (ii) the fair market value of the barge is less than $21,000,000, all of Swiber's interests in the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds resulting from the joint venture will be subordinate to our rights in such distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds until such time that we have received in distribution the return of the full amount of our contribution to the joint venture and a return at a monthly compounded rate equal to 15.51% per year. As the then current fair market value of the barge was less than $21,000,000, our Managing Trustee concluded that, commencing June 27, 2016, Swiber's rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return described above. Accordingly, the impairment loss recorded as of June 30, 2016 of $5,218,643 was allocated entirely to Swiber, the noncontrolling interest holder. As a result, the impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nOn July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. In November 2016, we obtained an updated third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the barge decreased to $14,770,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment loss of $3,105,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was allocated entirely to Swiber. The impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the three months ended September 30, 2016.\nOn November 28, 2016, Swiber Offshore filed an application for voluntary winding up and liquidation. Subsequently, our Managing Trustee has engaged in discussions with the court-appointed judicial manager of Swiber Holdings to, among other things, communicate our intention to sell the barge. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee commenced the process of marketing the barge for sale and it is currently engaged in negotiations with several interested parties. As of December 31, 2016, the barge met the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $7,170,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to write down the barge to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of $7,600,000. Swiber was only allocated $383,329 of such additional impairment loss because the balance of its noncontrolling interest in the joint venture had been reduced to zero. As a result, the remaining additional impairment loss of $6,786,671 was allocated to us during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Upon expiration of the charter on March 23, 2017, the joint venture's obligation to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable of $5,000,000 was extinguished pursuant to the purchase and charter agreement due to, among other things, Swiber Offshore's existing defaults on the charter. A gain of $5,000,000 from the extinguishment of the payable will be allocated entirely to us during the three months ending March 31, 2017.\nOn March 29, 2011, we and ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, entered into a joint venture, ICON AET Holdings, LLC (\"ICON AET\"), which was owned 25% by us and 75% by Fund Fourteen, for the purpose of acquiring two aframax tankers and two very large crude carriers (the \"VLCCs\", and collectively with the aframax tankers, the \"AET Vessels\"). Our contribution to the joint venture was $12,166,393. The aframax tankers, the Eagle Otome and the Eagle Subaru, were each acquired for $13,000,000 and were simultaneously bareboat chartered to AET Inc. Limited ( AET\u201d) for a period of three years. The VLCCs, the Eagle Vermont and the Eagle Virginia, were each acquired for $72,000,000 and were simultaneously bareboat chartered to AET for a period of 10 years. On April 14, 2014 and May 21, 2014, upon expiration of the leases with AET, ICON AET sold the aframax tankers to third-party purchasers for an aggregate price of $14,821,890. As a result, ICON AET recognized an aggregate gain on sale of assets of $2,229,932. Our share of such gain was $557,483, which is included within income from investment in joint ventures on our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. On June 8, 2016, an unaffiliated third party purchased 100% of the limited liability company interests of ICON AET for net sales proceeds of $48,798,058. As a result, we recorded a gain on sale of investment in joint venture of $2,012,669.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader (f/k/a the Arabian Express) were returned to us in accordance with the terms of the charters. Upon redelivery, the bareboat charters were terminated and we assumed the underlying time charters for the vessels. As we assumed operational responsibility of the vessels, we simultaneously contracted with Fleet Ship Management Inc. to manage the vessels on our behalf. Accordingly, these vessels were reclassified to Vessels on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, based on (i) the upcoming time charter expirations with no expectation that such charters would be renewed or timely replaced with new longer-term charter agreements and (ii) then current low time charter rates in the market, our Managing Trustee performed impairment analyses and concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. Our Managing Trustee estimated the fair market values of the vessels based on third-party valuations using a sales comparison approach. Based upon our Managing Trustee's assessment, the net book values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader exceeded their estimated undiscounted cash flows and their fair values and, as a result, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale and no further depreciation was recorded on the vessels. In September 2016, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were sold to unaffiliated third parties for a gross purchase price of $3,000,000 and $3,200,000, respectively. After deducting selling costs of $353,444, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of $303,943 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn March 21, 2014, a joint venture owned 75% by us, 12.5% by Fund Fourteen and 12.5% by ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P. ( Fund Fifteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, through two indirect subsidiaries, entered into memoranda of agreement to purchase the EPIC Vessels from Foreguard Shipping I Global Ships Ltd. (f/k/a Siva Global Ships Limited) ( Foreguard Shipping\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of $41,600,000. The EPIC Bali and the EPIC Borneo were delivered on March 28, 2014 and April 8, 2014, respectively. The EPIC Vessels were bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Foreguard Shipping for a period of eight years upon the delivery of each respective vessel. The EPIC Vessels were each acquired for approximately $3,550,000 in cash, $12,400,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB Group Merchant Bank (Asia) Ltd. ( DVB\u201d) and $4,750,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.\nOn June 12, 2014, a joint venture owned 75% by us, 12.5% by Fund Fourteen and 12.5% by Fund Fifteen purchased an offshore supply vessel from Pacific Crest Pte. Ltd. ( Pacific Crest\u201d) for $40,000,000. Simultaneously, the vessel was bareboat chartered to Pacific Crest for 10 years. The vessel was acquired for approximately $12,000,000 in cash, $26,000,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB and $2,000,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.\nManufacturing Equipment\nDuring 2008, ICON EAR, LLC ( ICON EAR\u201d), a joint venture owned 55% by us and 45% by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven Liquidating Trust (formerly, ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC) (\"Fund Eleven\"), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Equipment Acquisition Resources, Inc. ( EAR\u201d) for $15,729,500. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Managing Trustee filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ICON EAR sold its only remaining asset consisting of real property for $207,937. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale. Prior to the sale, ICON EAR recognized an impairment charge of $70,412 based on the then estimated fair value less cost to sell the real property.\nGiven the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Managing Trustee engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,209,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.\nOn January 4, 2012, MW Universal, Inc. ( MWU\u201d) and certain of its subsidiaries satisfied their obligations relating to two of the three lease schedules. On August 20, 2012, we sold the automotive manufacturing equipment subject to lease with LC Manufacturing, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MWU ( LC Manufacturing\u201d), and terminated warrants issued to us for aggregate proceeds of $8,300,000. As a result, based on our 93.67% ownership interest in ICON MW, LLC ( ICON MW\u201d), our joint venture with Fund Eleven, we received proceeds in the amount of $7,774,610 and recognized a loss on the sale of $88,786. In addition, our Managing Trustee evaluated the collectability of the personal guaranty of a previous owner of LC Manufacturing and, based on the findings, ICON MW recorded a credit loss of $5,411,484, of which our portion was $5,068,937. In February 2013, ICON MW commenced an action against the guarantor. On October 5, 2015, ICON MW received summary judgment against the guarantor on the issue of liability. A hearing to determine damages was held in July 2016. In September 2016, the court referee issued a report recommending a judgment in favor of ICON MW for (i) $5,660,000 in damages; (ii) $120,000 in attorney's fees; and (iii) $540,000 in prejudgment interest. The court confirmed the report and the recommended judgment in January 2017.\nMining Equipment\nOn September 12, 2013, a joint venture owned by us, Fund Eleven and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen ( Fund Sixteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Managing Trustee, purchased mining equipment for $15,106,570. The equipment was subject to a 24-month lease with Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Murray\u201d). On December 1, 2013 and February 1, 2014, Fund Sixteen contributed capital of $933,678 and $1,725,517, respectively, to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees. Subsequent to Fund Sixteen's second capital contribution, the joint venture was owned 13.2% by us, 67% by Fund Eleven and 19.8% by Fund Sixteen. As a result, we received corresponding returns of capital. The lease was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2015, but was extended for one month with an additional lease payment of $635,512. On October 29, 2015, Murray purchased the equipment pursuant to the terms of the lease for $2,991,400. As a result, a gain on sale of assets of $448,710 was recognized by the joint venture, of which our share was $59,230. Pursuant to a remarketing agreement with a third party, the joint venture paid an aggregate remarketing fee of $766,466 as part of the transaction.\nOn March 4, 2014, a joint venture owned 60% by us, 15% by Fund Fourteen, 15% by Fund Fifteen and 10% by Fund Sixteen purchased mining equipment from an affiliate of Blackhawk Mining, LLC ( Blackhawk\u201d). Simultaneously, the mining equipment was leased to Blackhawk and its affiliates for four years. The aggregate purchase price for the mining equipment of $25,359,446 was funded by $17,859,446 in cash and $7,500,000 of non-recourse long-term debt with People's Capital and Leasing Corp. ( People's Capital\u201d). The loan bears interest at a rate of 6.5% per year and matures on February 1, 2018. On October 27, 2015, the joint venture amended the lease with Blackhawk to waive Blackhawk's breach of a financial covenant during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in consideration for a partial prepayment of $3,502,514, which included an amendment fee of $75,000. In addition, corresponding amendments were made to certain payment and repurchase provisions of the lease to account for the partial prepayment. On December 8, 2015 and December 7, 2016, the joint venture further amended the lease with Blackhawk to, among other things, add, revise and/or waive Blackhawk's breach of certain financial covenants and received additional amendment fees of $75,000 and $150,000, respectively.\nOn September 18, 2014, a joint venture owned 55.817% by us and 44.183% by Hardwood Partners, LLC ( Hardwood\u201d) purchased mining equipment for $6,789,928. The equipment is subject to a 36-month lease with Murray, which expires on September 30, 2017.\nTrucks and Trailers\nOn March 28, 2014, a joint venture owned 60% by us, 27.5% by Fund Fifteen and 12.5% by Fund Sixteen purchased trucks, trailers and other equipment from subsidiaries of D&T Holdings, LLC ( D&T\u201d) for $12,200,000. Simultaneously, the trucks, trailers and other equipment were leased to D&T and its subsidiaries for 57 months. On September 15, 2014, the lease agreement with D&T was amended to allow D&T to increase its capital expenditure limit. In consideration for agreeing to such increase, lease payments of $1,480,000 that were scheduled to be paid in 2018 were paid by October 31, 2014. In addition, the joint venture received an amendment fee of $100,000, which was to be recognized as finance income throughout the remaining lease term. On January 14, 2016, D&T satisfied its remaining lease obligations by making a prepayment of $8,000,000. In addition, D&T exercised its option to repurchase all assets under the lease for $1, upon which title was transferred. As a result of the prepayment, we recognized finance income of approximately $1,400,000.\nNotes Receivable\nOn June 29, 2009, we and Fund Fourteen entered into a joint venture for the purpose of making secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $20,000,000 to INOVA Rentals Corporation (f/k/a ARAM Rentals Corporation) and INOVA Seismic Rentals Inc. (f/k/a ARAM Seismic Rental Inc.) (collectively, the INOVA Borrowers\u201d), which were scheduled to mature on August 1, 2014. In 2011, we exchanged our 52.09% ownership interest in the joint venture for our proportionate share of the notes receivable owned by the joint venture, which was subsequently deconsolidated and then terminated. The loans bore interest at 15% per year and were secured by a first priority security interest in all analog seismic system equipment owned by the INOVA Borrowers, among other collateral. On January 31, 2014, the INOVA Borrowers satisfied their obligations in connection with the loans by making a prepayment of $1,671,858. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\nOn June 30, 2010, we made two secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $9,600,000, one to Ocean Navigation 5 Co. Ltd. and one to Ocean Navigation 6 Co. Ltd. (collectively, Ocean Navigation\u201d), as part of a $96,000,000 term loan facility. The loans were funded between July 2010 and September 2010 and proceeds from the facility were used by Ocean Navigation to purchase two aframax tanker vessels, the Shah Deniz and the Absheron. The loans bore interest at 15.25% per year and were for a period of six years maturing between July and September 2016. The loans were secured by a second priority security interest in the vessels. On April 15, 2014, we sold all our interest in the loans with Ocean Navigation to Garanti Bank International, N.V. for $9,600,000. As a result, we wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable of $455,420 as a charge against finance income.\nOn February 29, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,000,000 to VAS Aero Services, LLC ( VAS\u201d) as part of a $42,755,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at variable rates ranging between 12% and 14.5% per year and matured on October 6, 2014. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of VAS's assets. During the year ended December 31, 2014, VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the loan as well as the balloon payment due on the maturity date. Our Managing Trustee engaged in discussions with VAS, VAS's owners, the senior creditor and other second lien creditors in order to put in place a viable restructuring or refinancing plan. In December 2014, this specific plan to restructure or refinance fell through. While discussions on other options were still ongoing, our Managing Trustee determined that we should record a credit loss reserve based on an estimated liquidation value of VAS's inventory and accounts receivable. As a result, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss reserve of $631,986 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 based on our pro-rata share of the liquidation value of the collateral. The value of the collateral was based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Managing Trustee making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,665 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB Loan, LLC ( GB\u201d) for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,719 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. In addition, we wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of $1,329,370 during the year ended December 31, 2015. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss reserve was $197,741 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn July 24, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $500,000 to affiliates of Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. (collectively, Frontier\u201d) as part of a $5,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 14% per year and was for a period of 66 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Frontier's saltwater disposal wells and related equipment and a second priority security interest in Frontier's other assets, including real estate, machinery and accounts receivable. On October 11, 2013, Frontier made a partial prepayment of $86,524, which included a prepayment fee of $8,924 that was recognized as additional finance income. On December 30, 2014, we sold all of our interest in the loan to Frontier Expansion and Development, LLC for $375,000. As a result, we recognized a loss and wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable totaling $62,365 as a charge against finance income.\nOn September 10, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $4,080,000 to Superior Tube Company, Inc. and Tubes Holdco Limited (collectively, Superior\u201d) as part of a $17,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12% per year and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Superior's assets, including tube manufacturing and related equipment and a mortgage on real property, and a second priority security interest in Superior's accounts receivable and inventory. On January 30, 2015, Superior satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $4,191,328, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $122,038. As a result, we recognized additional finance income of $50,550.\nOn November 28, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $4,050,000 to SAExploration, Inc., SAExploration Seismic Services (US), LLC and NES, LLC (collectively, SAE\u201d) as part of an $80,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per year and was for a period of 48 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in all existing and thereafter acquired assets, including seismic testing equipment, of SAE and its parent company, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. ( SAE Holdings\u201d), and a pledge of all the equity interests in SAE and SAE Holdings. In addition, we acquired warrants, exercisable until December 5, 2022, to purchase 0.051% of the outstanding common stock of SAE Holdings. On October 31, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement with SAE to amend certain provisions and covenant ratios. As a result of the amendment, we received an amendment fee of $30,687. On July 2, 2014, SAE satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $4,591,523, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and prepayment fees of $449,389. The prepayment fees were recognized as additional finance income. On July 21, 2014, we exercised the warrants and received net cash proceeds of $14,208, which resulted in a loss of $43,126 that was recorded in loss on derivative financial instruments.\nOn February 12, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,700,000 to NTS Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NTS\u201d) as part of a $6,000,000 facility. On March 28, 2013, NTS borrowed $765,000 and on June 27, 2013, NTS drew down the remaining $1,935,000 from the facility. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2017. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in all equipment and assets of NTS. On June 6, 2014, NTS satisfied their obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,701,212, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $102,600. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn April 5, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $3,870,000 to Lubricating Specialties Company ( LSC\u201d) as part of an $18,000,000 facility. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per year and was scheduled to mature on August 1, 2018. The loan was secured by, among other things, a second priority security interest in LSC's liquid storage tanks, blending lines, packaging equipment, accounts receivable and inventory. On December 30, 2016, LSC satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,954,424, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $57,930. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn December 22, 2011, a joint venture owned 25% by us and 75% by Fund Fourteen made a $20,124,000 subordinated term loan to JAC as part of a $171,050,000 term loan facility. Our initial contribution to this joint venture was $6,313,875. On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 21% by us, 39% by Fund Eleven and 40% by Fund Fifteen purchased a portion of a $208,038,290 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered for $28,462,500. Our initial contribution to this joint venture was $6,456,034. The loan and the facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15% per year and mature in January 2021. As a result of JAC's failure to make an expected payment that was due to the joint ventures during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the interest rate payable by JAC under the loan and the facility increased from 12.5% to 15.5%. The loan and the facility are secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex.\nDuring 2015, JAC experienced liquidity constraints as a result of a general economic slow-down in China and India, which led to lower demand from such countries, as well as the price decline of energy and other commodities. As a result, JAC's manufacturing facility ceased operations and JAC was not able to service interest payments under the loan and the facility. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an expected tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers that would have allowed JAC's manufacturing facility to resume operations did not commence as originally anticipated. Accordingly, our Managing Trustee determined that there was doubt regarding the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility. Our Managing Trustee visited JAC's manufacturing facility and engaged in discussions with JAC's other stakeholders to agree upon a restructuring plan. Based upon such discussions, which included a potential conversion of a portion of the loan and the facility to equity and/or a restructuring of the loan and the facility, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures may potentially not be able to recover approximately $13,500,000 to $47,300,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC under the loan and the facility as of June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures recognized a total credit loss of $33,264,710, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome based upon the negotiations at the time. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $7,834,118. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures placed the loan and the facility on non-accrual status and ceased to recognize finance income. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, discussions among the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. Our Managing Trustee reassessed the collectability of the loan and the facility by considering the following factors: (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. Our Managing Trustee also considered the proposed plan of converting a portion of the loan and the facility to equity and/or restructuring the loan and the facility in the event that JAC's stakeholders recommenced discussions. Based upon such reassessment, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures may potentially not be able to recover approximately $41,200,000 to $51,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC under the loan and the facility prior to recording the initial total credit loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the joint ventures recognized an additional total credit loss of $16,856,310, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,856,928.\nIn January 2016, our Managing Trustee engaged in further discussions with JAC's other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC's manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Managing Trustee anticipated that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC's manufacturing facility to recommence operations. Our Managing Trustee updated the collectability analysis under the loan and the facility as of December 31, 2015 and determined that comparable enterprise values derived from EBITDA multiples and trading prices of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries each decreased. In addition, our Managing Trustee considered that, as of December 31, 2015, (i) a tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers did not commence as originally anticipated; (ii) no further discussions occurred between JAC, the joint ventures, the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan and (iii) JAC's manufacturing facility continued to be non-operational. Based upon these factors, our Managing Trustee believed that the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility could result in less of a recovery from its prior estimate. As a result, our Managing Trustee determined to record an additional total credit loss of $10,137,863, which our Managing Trustee believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the total credit loss for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2,319,835. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Managing Trustee believes that the marketability of JAC's manufacturing facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Managing Trustee does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint ventures while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to $55,000,000, to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Managing Trustee determined that the joint ventures' ultimate collectability of the loan and the facility was further in doubt. As of June 30, 2016, our Managing Trustee updated its quarterly assessment and also considered the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint ventures' loan and facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Managing Trustee determined that the joint ventures should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the loan and the facility due from JAC as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the joint ventures recorded an additional total credit loss of $10,137,863 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of which our share was $2,319,835. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Receiver formally commenced the process of marketing JAC's manufacturing facility for sale. Our Managing Trustee continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC, the receivership process and the marketing process for sale of the manufacturing facility through regular communications with the Receiver and certain other stakeholders. The joint ventures did not recognize any finance income for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the joint ventures recognized finance income of $2,136,688 and $7,356,011, respectively, prior to the loan and the facility being considered impaired. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint ventures was $0 and $10,137,863, respectively, and our total investment in the joint ventures was $0 and $2,324,885, respectively.\nOn September 16, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $11,000,000 to Cenveo Corporation ( Cenveo\u201d). The loan bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), subject to a 1% floor, plus 11.0% per year, and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in specific equipment used to produce, print, fold, and package printed commercial envelopes. On October 31, 2013, we borrowed $7,150,000 of non-recourse long-term debt from NXT Capital, LLC ( NXT\u201d) secured by our interest in the loan to and collateral from Cenveo. The non-recourse long-term debt was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 6.5% per year. On July 7, 2014, Cenveo made a partial prepayment of $1,111,912 in connection with the loan, which included a net prepayment fee of $11,912. Simultaneously, we partially paid down our non-recourse long-term debt with NXT by making a payment of $702,915. On September 30, 2015, Cenveo satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $6,936,875, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $132,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. As a result of the prepayment by Cenveo, we satisfied our non-recourse long-term debt obligations with NXT by making a prepayment of $4,223,432.\nOn November 26, 2013, we, Fund Fifteen and a third-party creditor made a superpriority, secured term loan in the amount of $30,000,000 to Green Field Energy Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Green Field\u201d), of which our share was $7,500,000. The loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 10% per year and was scheduled to mature on August 26, 2014. The loan was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On March 18, 2014, Green Field satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $7,458,047, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\nOn June 17, 2014, we and Fund Fourteen entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with SeaChange Projects LLC ( SeaChange\u201d) to provide a credit facility of up to $7,000,000, of which our commitment was $6,300,000. On June 20, 2014 and August 20, 2014, we funded $4,050,000 and $2,250,000, respectively. The facility was used to partially finance SeaChange's acquisition and conversion of a containership vessel to meet certain time charter specifications of the Military Sealift Command of the Department of the United States Navy. The facility bore interest at 13.25% per year and was scheduled to mature on February 15, 2018. The facility was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in and earnings from the vessel and the equity interests of SeaChange. Due to SeaChange's inability to meet certain requirements of the Department of the United States Navy, which resulted in the cancellation of the time charter, SeaChange was required to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest under the facility in accordance with the loan agreement. On September 24, 2014, SeaChange satisfied its obligations by making a prepayment of $6,475,894, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest.\nOn July 14, 2014, we, Fund Fourteen and Fund Fifteen (collectively, ICON\u201d) entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA to provide a credit facility of up to $29,000,000 (the ICON Loan\u201d), of which our commitment of $21,750,000 was funded on August 27, 2014 (the TMA Initial Closing Date\u201d). The facility was used by TMA to acquire and refinance two platform supply vessels. At inception, the loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 17%. Upon the acceptance of both vessels by TMA's sub-charterer on September 19, 2014, the margin was reduced to 13%. On November 24, 2014, ICON entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA pursuant to which an unaffiliated third party agreed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of up to $89,000,000 (the Senior Loan\u201d, and collectively with the ICON Loan, the TMA Facility\u201d) to acquire two additional vessels. The TMA Facility has a term of five years from the TMA Initial Closing Date. As a result of the amendment, the margin for the ICON Loan increased to 15% and repayment of the ICON Loan became subordinated to the repayment of the Senior Loan. The TMA Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in the four vessels and TMA's right to the collection of hire with respect to earnings from the sub-charterer related to the four vessels. As of December 31, 2016, our share of the collateral value, net of the balance of the Senior Loan, was estimated to be approximately $4,800,000. The amendment qualified as a new loan under U.S. GAAP and therefore, we wrote off the initial direct costs and deferred revenue associated with the ICON Loan of $674,014 as a charge against finance income. As a condition to the amendment and increased size of the TMA Facility, TMA was required to cause all four platform supply vessels to be under contract by March 31, 2015. Due to TMA's failure to meet such condition, TMA has been in technical default and in payment default while available cash has been swept by the senior lender and applied to the Senior Loan in accordance with the loan agreement. As a result, the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. In January 2016, the remaining two previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. Based on, among other things, TMA's payment history and estimated collateral value as of December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due. Interest on the ICON Loan is currently being accrued.\nOn September 24, 2014, we, Fund Fourteen, Fund Fifteen and Fund Sixteen entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with Premier Trailer Leasing, Inc. (\"Premier Trailer\") to provide a credit facility of up to $20,000,000, of which our commitment of $10,000,000 was funded on such date. The loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 9% per year, and was for a period of six years. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of Premier Trailer's assets, including, without limitation, its fleet of trailers, and the equity interests of Premier Trailer. On August 9, 2016, Premier Trailer satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $10,327,777, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $200,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\nOn November 13, 2014, we and Fund Fourteen made secured term loans in the aggregate amount of $15,000,000 to NARL Marketing Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NARL\u201d) as a part of a $30,000,000 senior secured term loan credit facility, of which our commitment was $12,000,000. The loan bore interest at 10.75% per year and was for a period of three years. The loan was secured by a first priority security interest in all of NARL's existing and thereafter acquired assets including, but not limited to, its retail and wholesale fuel equipment, including pumps and storage tanks, and a mortgage on certain real properties. On May 7, 2015, NARL made a partial prepayment on the loan of $827,333 pursuant to the excess cash sweep provision of the loan agreement. On July 15, 2015, NARL made a voluntary partial prepayment on the loan of $6,296,859, which included a prepayment fee of $270,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. On August 6, 2015, NARL satisfied its obligations in full by making a prepayment of $4,319,854 pursuant to the excess cash sweep provision of the loan agreement, comprised of all outstanding principal and unpaid interest.\nAcquisition Fees\nWe did not enter into any new transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with the transactions that we entered into during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid acquisition fees to our Managing Trustee of $0 and $3,884,750, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. We adopted ASU 2014-15 on December 31, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. We adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 as of March 31, 2016. Consequently, we reclassified $610,405 of debt issuance costs from other non-current assets to non-recourse long-term debt, less current portion on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which resulted in the following adjustments:\n\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), requiring revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for goods and services. This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. Our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements is ongoing and our implementation efforts have included the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance and the evaluation of applicable revenue contracts. We continue to evaluate the timing of recognition of various revenue; however, since a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized from our leasing contracts, which is subject to ASU 2016-02 (as defined below), such revenue is excluded from our evaluation of ASU 2014-09.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07\u201d), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of credit losses by eliminating the probable initial recognition threshold set forth in current guidance, and instead reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation ( ASU 2016-17\u201d), which amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in such entity held by related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. Under ASU 2016-17, a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held by related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. The adoption of ASU 2016-17 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, we are required to apply the amendments within ASU 2016-17 retrospectively to when we initially applied the amendments within ASU 2015-02. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-17 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows ( ASU 2016-18\u201d), which provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-18 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which clarifies the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 sets forth requirements to be met for a set to be deemed a business and establishes a practical way to determine when a set is not a business. To be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output, and removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. In addition, ASU 2017-01 narrows the definition of outputs and aligns such definition with how outputs are described within the revenue guidance. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for transactions that occur before the issuance date or effective date of ASU 2017-01 to the extent that such transactions have not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our Managing Trustee to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:\n \u2022 Lease classification and revenue recognition; \n \u2022 Asset impairments; \n \u2022 Depreciation; \n \u2022 Notes receivable and revenue recognition; \n \u2022 Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; and \n \u2022 Derivative financial instruments. \nLease Classification and Revenue Recognition\nEach equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.\nOur Managing Trustee has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the estimated residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.\nThe residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.\nFor finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease, less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.\nAsset Impairments\nThe significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income in the period the determination is made.\nThe events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying asset is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset and, if applicable, the remaining obligation to the non-recourse lender. Generally in the latter situation, the residual position relates to equipment subject to third-party non-recourse debt where the lessee remits its rental payments directly to the lender and we do not recover our residual position until the non-recourse debt is repaid in full. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Managing Trustee's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.\nDepreciation\nWe record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease or vessel. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNotes Receivable and Revenue Recognition\nNotes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate the loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Our notes receivable may contain a paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision. Any PIK interest, if deemed collectible, will be added to the principal balance of the note receivable and is recorded as finance income.\nCredit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve\nOur Managing Trustee monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower's financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower's compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower's payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Managing Trustee may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower's facility and meet with a borrower's management to better understand such borrower's financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.\nAs our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Managing Trustee is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Managing Trustee does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Managing Trustee then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.\nFinancing receivables are generally placed on a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Managing Trustee periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Managing Trustee's judgment, these accounts may be placed on a non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables on non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.\nWhen our Managing Trustee deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe entered into derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We entered into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for warrants, which are not hedges. Certain derivatives did not meet the established criteria to be designated as qualifying accounting hedges, even though we believed that these were effective economic hedges.\nWe recognized all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and measured those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments were recognized immediately in earnings unless certain criteria were met. These criteria demonstrated that the derivative was expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and included an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the derivative. If these criteria were met, which we documented and assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis, we recognized the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI\u201d), a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of all derivatives were recognized immediately in earnings.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) and 2015 ( 2015\u201d)\nThe following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods. Further, these percentages are only representative of the percentage of the carrying value of such assets, finance income or rental income as of each stated period, and as such are not indicative of the concentration of any asset type or customer by the amount of equity invested or our investment portfolio as a whole.\nFinancing Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of assets securing the financing transactions in our portfolio:\n\nThe net carrying value of our financing transactions includes the balance of our net investment in notes receivable and our net investment in finance leases as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows:\n\nInterest income and prepayment fees from our net investment in notes receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance leases are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNon-performing Assets within Financing Transactions\nDuring 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss on our loan related to VAS of $697,384 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOn May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during 2015. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. During 2015, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis). No gain or loss was recognized during 2015 as a result of the sale of leased equipment (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases and charters in our portfolio:\n\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost, vessels and asset held for sale as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2016 and 2015, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total rental income as follows:\n\nImpaired Leased Assets within Operating Lease Transactions\nSince July 2016, Swiber Offshore has failed to make its monthly charter payments to the joint venture. On July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. During 2016, we obtained third-party appraisals indicating that the fair market value of the barge decreased below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed impairment analyses and recorded an aggregate impairment loss of $8,323,643 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As Swiber Offshore is in default of its obligations under the charter and the then current fair market value of the barge was less than $21,000,000, our Managing Trustee concluded that Swiber's rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return pursuant to the joint venture's operating agreement. As a result, the aggregate impairment loss was allocated entirely to Swiber, the noncontrolling interest holder.\nOn November 28, 2016, Swiber Offshore filed an application for voluntary winding up and liquidation. Subsequently, our Managing Trustee has engaged in discussions with the court-appointed judicial manager of Swiber Holdings to, among other things, communicate our intention to sell the barge. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Managing Trustee commenced the process of marketing the barge for sale and it is currently engaged in negotiations with several interested parties. As of December 31, 2016, the barge met the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $7,170,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to write down the barge to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of $7,600,000. Swiber was only allocated $383,329 of such additional impairment loss because the balance of its noncontrolling interest in the joint venture had been reduced to zero. As a result, the remaining additional impairment loss of $6,786,671 was allocated to us during the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying value of the barge was $7,600,000 and $24,528,856, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we recognized rental income of $3,652,500 and $7,305,000, respectively (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nDuring 2015, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader based on impairment analyses performed by our Managing Trustee, which concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. As of December 31, 2015, the net carrying value of such vessels was $5,720,000. In September 2016, the vessels were sold to unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate gross purchase price of $6,200,000. After deducting selling costs of $353,444, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of $303,943 during 2016. During 2016 and 2015, we recognized time charter revenue of $2,982,466 and $5,361,706, respectively (see \"Significant Transactions\" above).\nRevenue and other income for 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows:\n\nTotal revenue and other income for 2016 increased $3,287,073, or 15.6%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in loss from investment in joint ventures due to a lower credit loss recorded by the\njoint ventures related to JAC during 2016 as compared to 2015, (ii) a gain on sale of investment in joint venture as a result of the sale of our interests in ICON AET during 2016 and (iii) a gain on sale of vessels as a result of the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016. The increase was partially offset by decreases in (a) rental income due to no income recognition related to Swiber Offshore as collectability of monthly charter payments has been in doubt since July 2016, (b) finance income primarily due to several prepayments by our borrowers and lessees during 2015 and (c) time charter revenue due to the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader in September 2016, and lower charter rates related to such vessels during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nExpenses for 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:\n\nTotal expenses for 2016 decreased $4,760,530, or 12.3%, as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) the credit losses related to Patriot Coal and VAS that were recorded during 2015, of which there were no corresponding losses recorded during 2016, (ii) lower depreciation recorded related to the Swiber Chateau, the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader as such vessels were either no longer in operation or reclassified to assets held for sale at June 30, 2016, resulting in no further depreciation being recorded on such vessels, (iii) lower vessel operating expenses due to the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016 compared to a full year of vessel operating expenses during 2015 and (iv) lower interest expense as a result of scheduled repayments on our non-recourse long-term debt, and satisfying our non-recourse long-term debt related to Cenveo resulting from its prepayment during 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in impairment loss due to the impairment loss recorded in 2016 related to the Swiber Chateau, which was higher than the impairment loss recorded during 2015 related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader, and our share of the litigation settlement payment related to ICON EAR that was recorded in 2016.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests changed by $9,976,933, from net income of $4,181,980 in 2015 to a net loss of $5,794,953 in 2016. The change was primarily due to the allocation of a portion of the impairment loss related to the Swiber Chateau to Swiber during 2016.\nNet Loss Attributable to Fund Twelve Liquidating Trust\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net loss attributable to us for 2016 and 2015 was $3,689,159 and $21,713,695, respectively. Net loss attributable to us per weighted average additional Interest outstanding for 2016 and 2015 was $10.48 and $61.71, respectively.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015\u201d) and 2014 ( 2014\u201d)\nThe following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods. Further, these percentages are only representative of the percentage of the carrying value of such assets, finance income or rental income as of each stated period, and as such are not indicative of the concentration of any asset type or customer by the amount of equity invested or our investment portfolio as a whole.\nFinancing Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of assets securing the financing transactions in our portfolio:\n\nThe net carrying value of our financing transactions includes the balance of our net investment in notes receivable and our net investment in finance leases as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows:\n\nInterest income and prepayment fees from our net investment in notes receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance leases are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNon-performing Assets within Financing Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our impaired loan related to VAS was $966,359. The loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss of $697,384 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss was $197,741 in 2014 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOn May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month with an additional lease payment of $150,000 and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court's approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during 2015. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $159,694 (of which $150,000 was recognized on a cash basis) and $46,057, respectively. No gain or loss was recognized during 2015 as a result of the sale of leased equipment (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases and charters in our portfolio:\n\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost and vessels as of each reporting date.\nImpaired Assets within Operating Lease Transactions\nDuring 2015, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $11,149,619 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader based on impairment analyses performed by our Managing Trustee, which concluded that the carrying values of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader were not recoverable and that impairment existed. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net carrying value of such vessels was $5,720,000 and $18,266,677, respectively. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized time charter revenue of $5,361,706 and $4,132,289, respectively (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nDuring 2015 and 2014, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total rental income as follows:\n\nRevenue and other income for 2015 and 2014 is summarized as follows:\n\nTotal revenue and other income for 2015 decreased $70,134,341, or 76.9%, as compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in finance income related to the gain on exercise of purchase options associated with three of the Leighton Vessels by Leighton during 2014 with no comparable gain in 2015, (ii) our share of the loss from investment in joint ventures related to JAC due to the credit loss reserve recorded during 2015 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above) and (iii) a gain recognized in 2014 from the sale of marine diving equipment with no comparable gain in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in time charter revenue related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader as we commenced operating such vessels in April 2014.\nExpenses for 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:\n\nTotal expenses for 2015 increased $11,058,485, or 40.1%, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) impairment losses recorded related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2015, (ii) the credit loss recorded related to Patriot Coal during 2015 and (iii) an increase in depreciation expense due to entering into two new operating leases during 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expense reimbursements primarily due to costs incurred on our behalf by our Managing Trustee in connection with a proposed sale of our assets during our liquidation period in 2014 and lower costs incurred in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of the decrease in size of our investment portfolio during our liquidation period. These increases were also partially offset by decreases in (a) interest expense primarily as a result of the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt associated with three of the Leighton Vessels that were sold in 2014, (b) general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher legal fees incurred during 2014 related to EAR and other various matters as compared to 2015 and (c) management fees primarily due to the sale of three of the Leighton Vessels in 2014 and prepayments on our financing receivables, which included the sale of our interest in the loans with Ocean Navigation and the prepayment by SAE during 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $401,200, from $3,780,780 in 2014 to $4,181,980 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional consolidated joint ventures that we entered into during 2014.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income decreased $629,587, from $629,587 in 2014 to $0 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the termination or maturity of all our designated interest rate swaps in April 2014, which resulted in the reclassification from AOCI to interest expense and loss on derivative financial instruments during 2014 and (ii) the change in fair value of our designated interest rate swaps during 2014.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Fund Twelve Liquidating Trust\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net (loss) income attributable to us for 2015 and 2014 was $(21,713,695) and $59,880,331, respectively. Net (loss) income attributable to us per weighted average additional Interest outstanding for 2015 and 2014 was $(61.71) and $170.19, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nThis section discusses the major balance sheet variances at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets decreased $57,094,726, from $188,181,529 at December 31, 2015 to $131,086,803 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the use of cash to pay distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests, (ii) the impairment loss recorded related to the Swiber Chateau during 2016, (iii) the use of cash to repay our non-recourse long-term debt and (iv) depreciation recorded during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by gains recognized from the sale of certain of our investments and income generated from our investments during 2016.\nCurrent Assets\nCurrent assets increased $7,028,610, from $22,423,057 at December 31, 2015 to $29,451,667 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily a result of (i) additional accrued interest related to our loan with TMA and (ii) proceeds received from prepayments by Premier Trailer and LSC, as well as from the sale of certain non-current investments during 2016, partially offset by the use of cash to pay distributions to our beneficial owners and to repay our non-recourse long-term debt.\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities decreased $6,287,117, from $62,493,259 at December 31, 2015 to $56,206,142 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt and the payment of certain accrued liabilities during 2016.\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent liabilities increased $20,825,508, from $8,362,050 at December 31, 2015 to $29,187,558 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) the event of default on the non-recourse long-term debt related to the EPIC Vessels, which resulted in the reclassification of the outstanding balance of such debt to current liabilities, and (ii) the seller's credit that was due to Swiber in March 2017.\nEquity\nEquity decreased $50,807,609, from $125,688,270 at December 31, 2015 to $74,880,661 at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests and our net loss during 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10,255,053 and $8,404,092, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.5% of the gross offering proceeds. As of December 31, 2016, the cash reserve was $1,738,435. During our liquidation period, which commenced on May 1, 2014, we expect our main sources of cash will be from the collection of income and principal on our notes receivable and finance leases and proceeds from the sale of assets held directly by us or indirectly by our joint ventures and our main use of cash will be for distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from investments and proceeds from the sale of our investments exceed expenses and decreasing as we meet our debt obligations, pay distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments.\nWe anticipate being able to meet our liquidity requirements into the foreseeable future through the expected results of our operating activities, as well as cash received from our investments at maturity. However, our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our lessees' and borrowers' businesses that are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth summary cash flow data:\n\nNote: See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $7,250,286, from $26,170,007 in 2015 to $18,919,721 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to less cash receipts from operations in 2016 as compared to 2015 and a decrease in the collection of finance income as a result of the termination of a finance lease, partially offset by less cash being used to settle the amount due to our Managing Trustee during 2016 as a result of a reduction in expenses paid on our behalf by our Managing Trustee since 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities increased $4,855,276, from $25,629,739 in 2015 to $30,485,015 in 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our interests in ICON AET and from the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during 2016, partially offset by a decrease in principal received on notes receivable due to several prepayments during 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities decreased $11,252,442, from $58,806,217 in 2015 to $47,553,775 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the prepayment of our non-recourse long-term debt associated with Cenveo during 2015 as a result of the prepayment of a secured term loan by Cenveo and a decrease in distributions to our beneficial owners and noncontrolling interests during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nFinancings and Borrowings\nNon-Recourse Long-Term Debt\nWe had non-recourse long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $41,361,582 and $47,439,115, respectively. All of our non-recourse long-term debt obligations consist of notes payable in which the lender has a security interest in the underlying assets. If the borrower were to default on the underlying lease, resulting in our default on the non-recourse long-term debt, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of that debt. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total carrying value of assets subject to non-recourse long-term debt was $79,790,314 and $87,131,546, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our non-recourse long-term debt.\nRevolving Line of Credit, Recourse\nWe entered into an agreement with California Bank & Trust ( CB&T\u201d) for a revolving line of credit through March 31, 2015 of up to $10,000,000 (the Facility\u201d), which was secured by all of our assets not subject to a first priority lien. Amounts available under the Facility were subject to a borrowing base that was determined, subject to certain limitations, by the present value of future receivables under certain loans and lease agreements in which we had a beneficial interest.\nThe interest rate for general advances under the Facility was CB&T's prime rate. We could have elected to designate up to five advances on the outstanding principal balance of the Facility to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% per year. In all instances, borrowings under the Facility were subject to an interest rate floor of 4.0% per year. In addition, we were obligated to pay an annualized 0.50% fee on unused commitments under the Facility. On February 28, 2014 and March 31, 2014, we drew down $3,000,000 and $7,000,000, respectively, under the Facility. On November 6, 2014, we repaid the $10,000,000.\nOn December 22, 2014, the Facility with CB&T was terminated. There were no obligations outstanding as of the date of termination.\nDistributions\nWe, at our Managing Trustee's discretion, paid monthly distributions to each of our beneficial owners beginning with the first month after each such beneficial owner's admission to the LLC through the end of our operating period, which was April 30, 2014. Distributions paid through the Liquidating Trust will vary, depending on the timing of the sale of our assets and/or the maturity of our investments, and our receipt of rental, finance and other income from our investments. We paid distributions to our additional beneficial owners of $33,391,113, $37,944,866 and $25,257,603 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our Managing Trustee of $337,284, $383,282 and $255,127 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests of $7,595,100, $9,390,629 and $7,079,452 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Managing Trustee believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligation may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had non-recourse long-term debt and seller's credit. Each lender has a security interest in the majority of the assets collateralizing each non-recourse debt instrument and an assignment of the rental payments under the lease associated with the assets. In such cases, the lender is being paid directly by the lessee. In other cases, we receive the rental payments and pay the lender. If the lessee defaults on the lease, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of the non-recourse debt. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding non-recourse long-term indebtedness and seller's credit totaled $58,319,242.\nPrincipal and interest maturities of our debt, seller's credit and related interest consisted of the following at December 31, 2016:\n\n*Based on fixed or variable rates in effect at December 31, 2016.\nIn connection with certain debt obligations, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts with certain banks. At December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash of $3,471,147, which is presented within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring 2008, ICON EAR purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for $15,729,500. On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the 90-day period preceding EAR's bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Managing Trustee filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, ICON EAR sold its only remaining asset consisting of real property for $207,937. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale. Prior to the sale, ICON EAR recognized an impairment charge of $70,412 based on the then estimated fair value less cost to sell the real property.\nGiven the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Managing Trustee engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,209,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nNone.\nInflation and Interest Rates\nThe potential effects of inflation on us are difficult to predict. If the general economy experiences significant rates of inflation, however, it could affect us in a number of ways. We do not currently have or expect to have rent escalation clauses tied to inflation in our leases and most of our notes receivable contain fixed interest rates. The anticipated residual values to be realized upon the sale or re-lease of equipment upon lease termination (and thus the overall cash flow from our leases) may increase with inflation as the cost of similar new and used equipment increases.\nIf interest rates increase or decrease significantly, our leases and notes receivable already in place would generally not be affected.", "item_7_tables":
