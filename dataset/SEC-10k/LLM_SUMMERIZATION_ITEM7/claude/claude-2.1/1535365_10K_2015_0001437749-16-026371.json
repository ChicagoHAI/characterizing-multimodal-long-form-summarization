Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. None of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, none of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in expectations or predictions.\nAlthough the Trust is an emerging growth company subject to reduced public company reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities laws, it has elected not to make use of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act and has otherwise prepared the financial statements and disclosures included in this Form 10-K in a manner comparable to that of other iShares exchange-traded funds.\nAs described in Part I above, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The Index is a statistical composite that tracks a diversified group of commodities futures. The Index does not actually hold a portfolio of futures contracts and does not incur the fees and expenses incurred by the Trust. These fees and expenses negatively impact the Trust's performance relative to that of the Index.\nThe following graphs present the change in NAV of the Trust and the closing level of the Index for the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe Trust's net asset value decreased from $14,787,750 at December 31, 2014 to $4,816,999 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 350,000 Shares at December 31, 2014 to 150,000 Shares at December 31, 2015, a consequence of 550,000 Shares (11 Baskets) being created and 750,000 Shares (15 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The Trust's net asset value was also affected by a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations.\nThe 24.00% decline in the Trust's net asset value per Share from $42.25 at December 31, 2014 to $32.11 at December 31, 2015 is directly related to the 23.49% decrease in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The Trust's net asset value per Share decreased slightly more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor's fees and brokerage commissions.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4,331,439, resulting from a net investment loss of $145,027 and a net realized and unrealized loss of $4,186,412. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized loss of $1,402 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $4,185,010 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $126,802 and brokerage commissions and fees of $22,044, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe Trust's net asset value increased from $12,594,593 at December 31, 2013 to $14,787,750 at December 31, 2014. The increase in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 250,000 Shares at December 31, 2013 to 350,000 Shares at December 31, 2014, a consequence of 100,000 Shares (2 Baskets) being created and zero Shares being redeemed during the year. The Trust's net asset value was partially offset by a net loss.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,902,004, resulting from a net investment loss of $114,192 and a net realized and unrealized loss of $2,787,812. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $654 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $2,788,466 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $108,570 and brokerage commissions and fees of $11,889, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\nThe period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013\nThe Trust's net asset value increased from $5,000,000 at August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to $12,594,593 at December 31, 2013. The increase in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 100,000 Shares at August 8, 2013 to 250,000 Shares at December 31, 2013, a consequence of 150,000 Shares (3 Baskets) being created and zero Shares being redeemed during the period. The Trust's net asset value also benefitted from a net gain.\nNet gain for the period ended December 31, 2013 was $127,561, resulting from a net investment loss of $22,327 and a net realized and unrealized gain of $149,888. For the period ended December 31, 2013, the Trust had a net realized gain of $187 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of $149,701 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $19,456 and brokerage commissions and fees of $3,828, the Trust had no expenses during the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust's assets as of December 31, 2015 consist of Index Futures and Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Future positions. The Trust does not anticipate any further need for liquidity, because creations and redemptions of Shares generally occur in kind and ordinary expenses are met by cash on hand. Interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the Sponsor's fees and purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to Shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income was $3,819, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $126,802. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income was $6,267, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $108,570. For the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013, interest income was $957, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $19,456. In exchange for a fee based on the net asset value of the Trust, the Sponsor has assumed most of the ordinary expenses incurred by the Trust. In the case of an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, however, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its positions in Index Futures and Collateral Assets to pay such expenses. As of December 31, 2015, the market for Index Futures had not developed significant liquidity and the Trust represented substantially all of the long-side open interest in Index Futures. In addition, it is expected that UBS Securities or its accountholders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in such market. The existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate losses to the Trust if the Trust were required to liquidate its Index Future positions.\nThe Sponsor is unaware of any other trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to the Trust's liquidity needs.\nBecause the Trust trades Index Futures, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of the Index Futures or other assets (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform (credit risk).\nMarket Risk\nThe Trust holds Index Future positions and Collateral Assets to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Future positions. Because of this limited diversification of the Trust's assets, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. The value of the Index Futures is expected to track generally the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, although this correlation may not be exact. The Bloomberg Roll Select CI, in turn, reflects the value of a diversified group of commodities, while also seeking to minimize the effect of contango and maximize the effect of backwardation in connection with periodically switching or rolling\u201d into new futures contracts. The Trust's exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Future market and activities of other market participants.\nCredit Risk\nWhen the Trust purchases or holds Index Futures, it is exposed to the credit risk of a default by the CME's clearing house, which serves as the counterparty to each Index Future position, and of a default by its Clearing FCM. In the case of such a default, the Trust may be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Future positions and Collateral Assets posted as margin. The Trust is also exposed to credit risk as a result of its ownership of U.S. Treasury bills.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Trust does not use and is not expected to use special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust does not have and is not expected to have loan guarantee arrangements or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services that are in the interest of the Trust. While the Trust's exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Trust's financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust's financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust's application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust's accounting policies.\nItem7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nQuantitative Disclosure\nThe Trust is exposed to commodity price risk through the Trust's holdings of Index Futures. The following table provides information about the Trust's futures contract positions, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2015, the Trust's open Index Future positions (long) were as follows:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> Number of Contracts:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expiration Date: </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-Average Price per Contract:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notional Amount (Fair Value):\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,806,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe notional amount is calculated using the settlement price for the Index Futures on the CME on December 31, 2015, which was $192.24 per contract, and the $100 multiplier applicable under the contract terms.\nQualitative Disclosure\nAs described herein, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The Index itself is intended to reflect the performance of a diversified group of physical commodities, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust obtains this exposure to commodity prices through the Trust's Index Future positions. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Trust will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, or the value of any Collateral Assets. The Trust's exposure to market risk may be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Future market and activities of other market participants.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with accountants during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nThe duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Sponsor's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trust's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trust's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In making its assessment, the Sponsor's management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on their assessment and those criteria, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of an independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As an emerging growth company, the Trust is exempt from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and accordingly has not engaged any independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust's fourth fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

The Sponsor is an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the Advisor\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC.\nThe Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes and follows the accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, but is not registered, and is not required to be registered, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\n2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> A.\n</td> <td> Basis of Accounting\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following significant accounting policies are consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain statements and captions in the financial statements for the prior year have been changed to conform to the current financial statement presentation. Certain amounts in the financial statements for the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> B.\n</td> <td> Investment in Index Futures\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities, which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities.\nThe assets of the Trust consist of Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. Index Futures are exchange-traded index futures contracts on the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, and are expected to include contracts of different\nterms and expirations. The Trust is expected to roll out of existing positions in Index Futures and establish new positions in Index Futures on an ongoing basis. When establishing positions in Index Futures, the Trust is required to deposit cash or other Collateral Assets with the broker as initial margin.\u201d On a\ndaily basis, the Trust is obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, cash in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Index Futures positions. Such payments or receipts are known as variation margin and recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When an Index Futures contract is closed, the Trust records a realized gain or loss based on the difference between the value of the Index Futures contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.\nIndex Futures are derivative instruments valued at fair value, which the Trustee has determined to be that day's announced CME settlement price. If there is no announced settlement price for a particular Index Future contract on that day, the Trustee will use the most recently announced CME settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The Trust's derivatives are not designated as hedges, and all changes in the fair value are reflected in the statements of operations.\nFor futures contracts, counterparty credit risk is mitigated because futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange's clearing house acts as central counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts (although customers continue to have credit exposure to the clearing member who holds their account).\nPlease refer to Note 9 for additional disclosures regarding the Trust's investments in futures contracts.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> C.\n</td> <td> Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust considers cash and cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Trust had cash and cash equivalents held at brokers of $225,000 and $535,000, respectively, which were posted as margin for the Trust's Index Future positions.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> D.\n</td> <td> Short-Term Investments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term investments on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities consist principally of short-term fixed income securities with original maturities of one year or less. These investments are valued at fair value.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> E.\n</td> <td> Securities Transactions, Income and Expense Recognition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined using the specific identification method. Other income and expenses are recognized on the accrual basis.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> F.\n</td> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust is treated as a partnership for federal, state and local income tax purposes.\nNo provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements because the Trust is not subject to income taxes. Shareholders are individually responsible for their own tax payments on their proportionate share of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit.\nThe Sponsor has reviewed the tax positions as of December 31, 2015, inclusive of the open tax return years, and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust's financial statements.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> G.\n</td> <td> Calculation of Net Asset Value\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net asset value of the Trust on any given day is obtained by subtracting the Trust's accrued expenses and other liabilities on that day from the value of (1) the Trust's Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets on that day, (2) the interest earned on those assets by the Trust and (3) any other assets of the Trust, as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time) that day. The Trustee determines the net asset value per Share (the NAV\u201d) by dividing the net asset value of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. The NAV is calculated each day on which NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca\u201d) is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time).\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> H.\n</td> <td> Distributions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and distributions received by the Trust on its assets may be used to acquire additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to shareholders. The Trust is under no obligation to make periodic distributions to shareholders.\n3 - Offering of the Shares\nShares are issued and redeemed continuously in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares in exchange for Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash). Individual investors that are not Authorized Participants cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. The Trust transacts only with registered broker-dealers that have entered into a contractual arrangement with the Trust and the Sponsor governing, among other matters, the creation and redemption of Shares (such authorized broker-dealers are the Authorized Participants\u201d). Authorized Participants may redeem their Shares (as well as Shares on behalf of other investors) at any time before 2:40 p.m. (New York time) on any business day in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares. Redemptions of Shares in exchange for baskets of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash) are treated as sales for financial statement purposes.\n4 - Trust Expenses\nThe Trust is responsible for paying any applicable brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees out of its assets in connection with the roll of Index Futures held by the Trust. These expenses are recorded as brokerage commissions and fees in the Statements of Operations as incurred.\nThe Sponsor pays the amounts that would otherwise be considered the ordinary operating expenses, if any, of the Trust. In return, the Sponsor receives an allocation from the Trust that accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.75% of the net asset value of the Trust, as calculated before deducting fees and expenses based on the value of the Trust's assets.\nThe Sponsor has agreed under the Trust Agreement to pay the following administrative, operational and marketing expenses: (1) the fees of the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor and their respective agents, (2) NYSE Arca listing fees, (3) printing and mailing costs, (4) audit fees, (5) fees for registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (6) tax reporting costs, (7) license fees and (8) legal expenses relating to the Trust of up to $100,000 annually.\n5 - Related Parties\nThe Sponsor, the Trustee and the Advisor are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee's and Advisor's fees are paid by the Sponsor and are not a separate expense of the Trust.\n6 - Indemnification\nThe Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries and agents shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, claim, cost, expense or judgment of any kind whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Trust Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement.\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Advisor provides that the Advisor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, cost, expense or judgment (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Advisory Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\n7 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nIn the normal course of business, the Trust may enter into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.\n8 - Financial Highlights\nThe following financial highlights relate to investment performance and operations for a Share outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Period from\nAugust 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value per Share, beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment loss(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.34 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.40 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized and unrealized gain (loss)(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.80 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.73 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.14 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.13 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value per Share, end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total return, at net asset value (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.14 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.76%(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio to average net assets:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment loss(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.86 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.79 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.85 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Based on average Shares outstanding during each period.\n(b) The amounts reported for a Share outstanding may not accord with the change in aggregate gains and losses on investments for the period due to the timing of Trust Share transactions in relation to the fluctuating fair values of the Trust's underlying investments.\n(c) Based on the change in net asset value of a Share during each period.\n(d) Percentage is not annualized.\n(e) Percentage is annualized.\n9 - Investing in Index Futures\nSubstantially all of the Trust's assets are invested in Index Futures. The Index Futures' settlement value at expiration is based on the value of Bloomberg Roll Select CI at that time. Therefore, the value of the Trust will fluctuate based upon the value of the Bloomberg Roll Select CI and the prices of futures contracts and commodities underlying the Bloomberg Roll Select CI. The commodities markets have historically been extremely volatile. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the average month-end notional amounts of open Index Futures were $15,463,265 and $14,351,951, respectively.\nThe following table shows the variation margin on open futures contracts, by risk exposure category, on the statements of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Asset Derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Liability Derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Receivable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> Payable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Receivable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> Payable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,379 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the effect of the futures contracts, by risk exposure category, on the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Statement of\nOperations Location\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Net Realized Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,002,141 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>817,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,971,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(817,035 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,016 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n10 - Investment Valuation\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trust's policy is to value its investments at fair value.\nInvestments in Index Futures are measured at fair value using the last reported CME settlement price for Index Futures.\nU.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services. In determining the value of a fixed income investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrixes, market transactions in comparable investments, various relationships observed in the market between investments and calculated yield measures.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. Inputs may be based on independent market data ( observable inputs\u201d) or they may be internally developed ( unobservable inputs\u201d). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 1 -\n</td> <td> Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 2 -\n</td> <td> Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 3 -\n</td> <td> Unobservable inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust's assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust's net asset value and the prices used by the Trust's underlying index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust's performance and the performance of the Trust's underlying index.\nThe following table summarizes the value of each of the Trust's investments by the fair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Futures contracts(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,920 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,920 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury bills\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,499,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,499,782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Futures contracts(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(842,051 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(842,051 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury bills\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,438,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,438,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Shown at the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the contracts.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned in the capacities* indicated, thereunto duly authorized.\nFor purposes of CFTC Rule 4.22(h), to the best of the knowledge and belief of the undersigned, the information contained in the CFTC Annual Report set forth herein is accurate and complete.\niShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC,\nSponsor of the iShares Commodity Optimized Trust (registrant)\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> /s/ Paul Lohrey\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaul Lohrey\nDirector, President and Chief Executive Officer\n(Principal executive officer)\nDate: February 29, 2016\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> /s/ Jack Gee\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nJack Gee\nDirector and Chief Financial Officer\n(Principal financial and accounting officer)\nDate: February 29, 2016\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> /s/ Philip Jensen\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhilip Jensen\nDirector\nDate: February 29, 2016\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> /s/ Peter Landini\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPeter Landini\nDirector\nDate: February 29, 2016\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> /s/ Kimun Lee\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKimun Lee\nDirector\nDate: February 29, 2016\n* The registrant is a trust and the persons are signing in their respective capacities as officers or directors of iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, the Sponsor of the registrant.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. None of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, none of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in expectations or predictions.\nAlthough the Trust is an emerging growth company subject to reduced public company reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities laws, it has elected not to make use of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act and has otherwise prepared the financial statements and disclosures included in this Form 10-K in a manner comparable to that of other iShares exchange-traded funds.\nAs described in Part I above, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The Index is a statistical composite that tracks a diversified group of commodities futures. The Index does not actually hold a portfolio of futures contracts and does not incur the fees and expenses incurred by the Trust. These fees and expenses negatively impact the Trust's performance relative to that of the Index.\nThe following graphs present the change in NAV of the Trust and the closing level of the Index for the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015:\n \n \n \nResults of Operations\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe Trust's net asset value decreased from $14,787,750 at December 31, 2014 to $4,816,999 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 350,000 Shares at December 31, 2014 to 150,000 Shares at December 31, 2015, a consequence of 550,000 Shares (11 Baskets) being created and 750,000 Shares (15 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The Trust's net asset value was also affected by a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations.\nThe 24.00% decline in the Trust's net asset value per Share from $42.25 at December 31, 2014 to $32.11 at December 31, 2015 is directly related to the 23.49% decrease in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The Trust's net asset value per Share decreased slightly more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor's fees and brokerage commissions.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4,331,439, resulting from a net investment loss of $145,027 and a net realized and unrealized loss of $4,186,412. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized loss of $1,402 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $4,185,010 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $126,802 and brokerage commissions and fees of $22,044, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe Trust's net asset value increased from $12,594,593 at December 31, 2013 to $14,787,750 at December 31, 2014. The increase in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 250,000 Shares at December 31, 2013 to 350,000 Shares at December 31, 2014, a consequence of 100,000 Shares (2 Baskets) being created and zero Shares being redeemed during the year. The Trust's net asset value was partially offset by a net loss.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,902,004, resulting from a net investment loss of $114,192 and a net realized and unrealized loss of $2,787,812. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $654 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $2,788,466 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $108,570 and brokerage commissions and fees of $11,889, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\nThe period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013\nThe Trust's net asset value increased from $5,000,000 at August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to $12,594,593 at December 31, 2013. The increase in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 100,000 Shares at August 8, 2013 to 250,000 Shares at December 31, 2013, a consequence of 150,000 Shares (3 Baskets) being created and zero Shares being redeemed during the period. The Trust's net asset value also benefitted from a net gain.\nNet gain for the period ended December 31, 2013 was $127,561, resulting from a net investment loss of $22,327 and a net realized and unrealized gain of $149,888. For the period ended December 31, 2013, the Trust had a net realized gain of $187 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of $149,701 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $19,456 and brokerage commissions and fees of $3,828, the Trust had no expenses during the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust's assets as of December 31, 2015 consist of Index Futures and Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Future positions. The Trust does not anticipate any further need for liquidity, because creations and redemptions of Shares generally occur in kind and ordinary expenses are met by cash on hand. Interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the Sponsor's fees and purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to Shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income was $3,819, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $126,802. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income was $6,267, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $108,570. For the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013, interest income was $957, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $19,456. In exchange for a fee based on the net asset value of the Trust, the Sponsor has assumed most of the ordinary expenses incurred by the Trust. In the case of an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, however, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its positions in Index Futures and Collateral Assets to pay such expenses. As of December 31, 2015, the market for Index Futures had not developed significant liquidity and the Trust represented substantially all of the long-side open interest in Index Futures. In addition, it is expected that UBS Securities or its accountholders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in such market. The existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate losses to the Trust if the Trust were required to liquidate its Index Future positions.\nThe Sponsor is unaware of any other trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to the Trust's liquidity needs.\nBecause the Trust trades Index Futures, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of the Index Futures or other assets (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform (credit risk).\nMarket Risk\nThe Trust holds Index Future positions and Collateral Assets to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Future positions. Because of this limited diversification of the Trust's assets, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. The value of the Index Futures is expected to track generally the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, although this correlation may not be exact. The Bloomberg Roll Select CI, in turn, reflects the value of a diversified group of commodities, while also seeking to minimize the effect of contango and maximize the effect of backwardation in connection with periodically switching or rolling\u201d into new futures contracts. The Trust's exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Future market and activities of other market participants.\nCredit Risk\nWhen the Trust purchases or holds Index Futures, it is exposed to the credit risk of a default by the CME's clearing house, which serves as the counterparty to each Index Future position, and of a default by its Clearing FCM. In the case of such a default, the Trust may be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Future positions and Collateral Assets posted as margin. The Trust is also exposed to credit risk as a result of its ownership of U.S. Treasury bills.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Trust does not use and is not expected to use special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust does not have and is not expected to have loan guarantee arrangements or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services that are in the interest of the Trust. While the Trust's exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Trust's financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust's financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust's application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust's accounting policies.\nItem7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nQuantitative Disclosure\nThe Trust is exposed to commodity price risk through the Trust's holdings of Index Futures. The following table provides information about the Trust's futures contract positions, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2015, the Trust's open Index Future positions (long) were as follows:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> Number of Contracts:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expiration Date: </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-Average Price per Contract:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notional Amount (Fair Value):\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,806,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe notional amount is calculated using the settlement price for the Index Futures on the CME on December 31, 2015, which was $192.24 per contract, and the $100 multiplier applicable under the contract terms.\nQualitative Disclosure\nAs described herein, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The Index itself is intended to reflect the performance of a diversified group of physical commodities, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust obtains this exposure to commodity prices through the Trust's Index Future positions. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Trust will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, or the value of any Collateral Assets. The Trust's exposure to market risk may be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Future market and activities of other market participants.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with accountants during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nThe duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Sponsor's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trust's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trust's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In making its assessment, the Sponsor's management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on their assessment and those criteria, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of an independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As an emerging growth company, the Trust is exempt from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and accordingly has not engaged any independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust's fourth fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

Statements\nDecember 31, 2015\n1 - Organization\nThe iShares Commodity Optimized Trust (the Trust\u201d) is a Delaware statutory trust that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 7, 2011 and commenced operations on August 8, 2013. iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor\u201d). The sole member and manager of the Sponsor is BlackRock Asset Management International Inc., a Delaware corporation. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. is the Trustee\u201d of the Trust. The Trust is governed by the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2014 (the Trust Agreement\u201d), among the Sponsor, the Trustee and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the Delaware Trustee\u201d). The Trust issues units of beneficial interest ( Shares\u201d) representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The Trust holds long positions in exchange-traded index futures contracts of various expirations, or Index Futures\u201d on the Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index (the Bloomberg Roll Select CI\u201d). In order to collateralize its Index Futures positions and to reflect the U.S. Treasury component of the Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Total Return Index (the Index\u201d), the Trust also holds Collateral Assets,\u201d which consist of cash, U.S. Treasury securities or other short-term securities and similar securities that are eligible as margin deposits for those Index Futures positions. The Index Futures held by the Trust are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the CME\u201d).\nThe Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of\nthe Trust's expenses and liabilities.\nThe Trust is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA\u201d) and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC\u201d), and is operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. The Sponsor is an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the Advisor\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC.\nThe Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes and follows the accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, but is not registered, and is not required to be registered, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\n2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n A. Basis of Accounting \nThe following significant accounting policies are consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain statements and captions in the financial statements for the prior year have been changed to conform to the current financial statement presentation. Certain amounts in the financial statements for the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.\n B. Investment in Index Futures \nThe Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities, which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities.\nThe assets of the Trust consist of Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. Index Futures are exchange-traded index futures contracts on the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, and are expected to include contracts of different\nterms and expirations. The Trust is expected to roll out of existing positions in Index Futures and establish new positions in Index Futures on an ongoing basis. When establishing positions in Index Futures, the Trust is required to deposit cash or other Collateral Assets with the broker as initial margin.\u201d On a\ndaily basis, the Trust is obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, cash in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Index Futures positions. Such payments or receipts are known as variation margin and recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When an Index Futures contract is closed, the Trust records a realized gain or loss based on the difference between the value of the Index Futures contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.\nIndex Futures are derivative instruments valued at fair value, which the Trustee has determined to be that day's announced CME settlement price. If there is no announced settlement price for a particular Index Future contract on that day, the Trustee will use the most recently announced CME settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The Trust's derivatives are not designated as hedges, and all changes in the fair value are reflected in the statements of operations.\nFor futures contracts, counterparty credit risk is mitigated because futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange's clearing house acts as central counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts (although customers continue to have credit exposure to the clearing member who holds their account).\nPlease refer to Note 9 for additional disclosures regarding the Trust's investments in futures contracts.\n C. Cash and Cash Equivalents \nThe Trust considers cash and cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Trust had cash and cash equivalents held at brokers of $225,000 and $535,000, respectively, which were posted as margin for the Trust's Index Future positions.\n D. Short-Term Investments \nShort-term investments on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities consist principally of short-term fixed income securities with original maturities of one year or less. These investments are valued at fair value.\n E. Securities Transactions, Income and Expense Recognition \nSecurities transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined using the specific identification method. Other income and expenses are recognized on the accrual basis.\n F. Income Taxes \nThe Trust is treated as a partnership for federal, state and local income tax purposes.\nNo provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements because the Trust is not subject to income taxes. Shareholders are individually responsible for their own tax payments on their proportionate share of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit.\nThe Sponsor has reviewed the tax positions as of December 31, 2015, inclusive of the open tax return years, and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust's financial statements.\n G. Calculation of Net Asset Value \nThe net asset value of the Trust on any given day is obtained by subtracting the Trust's accrued expenses and other liabilities on that day from the value of (1) the Trust's Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets on that day, (2) the interest earned on those assets by the Trust and (3) any other assets of the Trust, as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time) that day. The Trustee determines the net asset value per Share (the NAV\u201d) by dividing the net asset value of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. The NAV is calculated each day on which NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca\u201d) is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time).\n H. Distributions \nInterest and distributions received by the Trust on its assets may be used to acquire additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to shareholders. The Trust is under no obligation to make periodic distributions to shareholders.\n3 - Offering of the Shares\nShares are issued and redeemed continuously in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares in exchange for Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash). Individual investors that are not Authorized Participants cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. The Trust transacts only with registered broker-dealers that have entered into a contractual arrangement with the Trust and the Sponsor governing, among other matters, the creation and redemption of Shares (such authorized broker-dealers are the Authorized Participants\u201d). Authorized Participants may redeem their Shares (as well as Shares on behalf of other investors) at any time before 2:40 p.m. (New York time) on any business day in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares. Redemptions of Shares in exchange for baskets of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash) are treated as sales for financial statement purposes.\n4 - Trust Expenses\nThe Trust is responsible for paying any applicable brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees out of its assets in connection with the roll of Index Futures held by the Trust. These expenses are recorded as brokerage commissions and fees in the Statements of Operations as incurred.\nThe Sponsor pays the amounts that would otherwise be considered the ordinary operating expenses, if any, of the Trust. In return, the Sponsor receives an allocation from the Trust that accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.75% of the net asset value of the Trust, as calculated before deducting fees and expenses based on the value of the Trust's assets.\nThe Sponsor has agreed under the Trust Agreement to pay the following administrative, operational and marketing expenses: (1) the fees of the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor and their respective agents, (2) NYSE Arca listing fees, (3) printing and mailing costs, (4) audit fees, (5) fees for registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (6) tax reporting costs, (7) license fees and (8) legal expenses relating to the Trust of up to $100,000 annually.\n5 - Related Parties\nThe Sponsor, the Trustee and the Advisor are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee's and Advisor's fees are paid by the Sponsor and are not a separate expense of the Trust.\n6 - Indemnification\nThe Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries and agents shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, claim, cost, expense or judgment of any kind whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Trust Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement.\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Advisor provides that the Advisor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, cost, expense or judgment (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Advisory Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\n7 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nIn the normal course of business, the Trust may enter into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.\n8 - Financial Highlights\nThe following financial highlights relate to investment performance and operations for a Share outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Period from\nAugust 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value per Share, beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment loss(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.34 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.40 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized and unrealized gain (loss)(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.80 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.73 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.14 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.13 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value per Share, end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total return, at net asset value (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.14 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.76%(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio to average net assets:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment loss(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.86 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.79 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.85 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Based on average Shares outstanding during each period.\n(b) The amounts reported for a Share outstanding may not accord with the change in aggregate gains and losses on investments for the period due to the timing of Trust Share transactions in relation to the fluctuating fair values of the Trust's underlying investments.\n(c) Based on the change in net asset value of a Share during each period.\n(d) Percentage is not annualized.\n(e) Percentage is annualized.\n9 - Investing in Index Futures\nSubstantially all of the Trust's assets are invested in Index Futures. The Index Futures' settlement value at expiration is based on the value of Bloomberg Roll Select CI at that time. Therefore, the value of the Trust will fluctuate based upon the value of the Bloomberg Roll Select CI and the prices of futures contracts and commodities underlying the Bloomberg Roll Select CI. The commodities markets have historically been extremely volatile. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the average month-end notional amounts of open Index Futures were $15,463,265 and $14,351,951, respectively.\nThe following table shows the variation margin on open futures contracts, by risk exposure category, on the statements of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Asset Derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Liability Derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Receivable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> Payable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Receivable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> Payable for variation margin on open futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,379 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the effect of the futures contracts, by risk exposure category, on the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Statement of\nOperations Location\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Net Realized Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,002,141 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>817,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,971,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(817,035 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodity contracts\n</td> <td> Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,016 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n10 - Investment Valuation\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trust's policy is to value its investments at fair value.\nInvestments in Index Futures are measured at fair value using the last reported CME settlement price for Index Futures.\nU.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services. In determining the value of a fixed income investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrixes, market transactions in comparable investments, various relationships observed in the market between investments and calculated yield measures.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. Inputs may be based on independent market data ( observable inputs\u201d) or they may be internally developed ( unobservable inputs\u201d). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \n Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and \n Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust's assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments. \nFair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust's net asset value and the prices used by the Trust's underlying index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust's performance and the performance of the Trust's underlying index.\nThe following table summarizes the value of each of the Trust's investments by the fair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Futures contracts(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,920 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,920 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury bills\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,499,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,499,782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Futures contracts(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(842,051 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(842,051 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury bills\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,438,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,438,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Shown at the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the contracts.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned in the capacities* indicated, thereunto duly authorized.\nFor purposes of CFTC Rule 4.22(h), to the best of the knowledge and belief of the undersigned, the information contained in the CFTC Annual Report set forth herein is accurate and complete.\niShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC,\nSponsor of the iShares Commodity Optimized Trust (registrant)\n /s/ Paul Lohrey \nPaul Lohrey\nDirector, President and Chief Executive Officer\n(Principal executive officer)\nDate: February 29, 2016\n /s/ Jack Gee \nJack Gee\nDirector and Chief Financial Officer\n(Principal financial and accounting officer)\nDate: February 29, 2016\n /s/ Philip Jensen \nPhilip Jensen\nDirector\nDate: February 29, 2016\n /s/ Peter Landini \nPeter Landini\nDirector\nDate: February 29, 2016\n /s/ Kimun Lee \nKimun Lee\nDirector\nDate: February 29, 2016\n* The registrant is a trust and the persons are signing in their respective capacities as officers or directors of iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, the Sponsor of the registrant.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. None of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, none of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Advisor, the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in expectations or predictions.\nAlthough the Trust is an emerging growth company subject to reduced public company reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities laws, it has elected not to make use of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act and has otherwise prepared the financial statements and disclosures included in this Form 10-K in a manner comparable to that of other iShares exchange-traded funds.\nAs described in Part I above, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The Index is a statistical composite that tracks a diversified group of commodities futures. The Index does not actually hold a portfolio of futures contracts and does not incur the fees and expenses incurred by the Trust. These fees and expenses negatively impact the Trust's performance relative to that of the Index.\nThe following graphs present the change in NAV of the Trust and the closing level of the Index for the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015:\n \n \n \nResults of Operations\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe Trust's net asset value decreased from $14,787,750 at December 31, 2014 to $4,816,999 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 350,000 Shares at December 31, 2014 to 150,000 Shares at December 31, 2015, a consequence of 550,000 Shares (11 Baskets) being created and 750,000 Shares (15 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The Trust's net asset value was also affected by a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations.\nThe 24.00% decline in the Trust's net asset value per Share from $42.25 at December 31, 2014 to $32.11 at December 31, 2015 is directly related to the 23.49% decrease in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The Trust's net asset value per Share decreased slightly more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor's fees and brokerage commissions.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4,331,439, resulting from a net investment loss of $145,027 and a net realized and unrealized loss of $4,186,412. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized loss of $1,402 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $4,185,010 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $126,802 and brokerage commissions and fees of $22,044, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe Trust's net asset value increased from $12,594,593 at December 31, 2013 to $14,787,750 at December 31, 2014. The increase in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 250,000 Shares at December 31, 2013 to 350,000 Shares at December 31, 2014, a consequence of 100,000 Shares (2 Baskets) being created and zero Shares being redeemed during the year. The Trust's net asset value was partially offset by a net loss.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,902,004, resulting from a net investment loss of $114,192 and a net realized and unrealized loss of $2,787,812. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $654 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $2,788,466 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $108,570 and brokerage commissions and fees of $11,889, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\nThe period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013\nThe Trust's net asset value increased from $5,000,000 at August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to $12,594,593 at December 31, 2013. The increase in the Trust's net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 100,000 Shares at August 8, 2013 to 250,000 Shares at December 31, 2013, a consequence of 150,000 Shares (3 Baskets) being created and zero Shares being redeemed during the period. The Trust's net asset value also benefitted from a net gain.\nNet gain for the period ended December 31, 2013 was $127,561, resulting from a net investment loss of $22,327 and a net realized and unrealized gain of $149,888. For the period ended December 31, 2013, the Trust had a net realized gain of $187 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of $149,701 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor's fees of $19,456 and brokerage commissions and fees of $3,828, the Trust had no expenses during the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust's assets as of December 31, 2015 consist of Index Futures and Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Future positions. The Trust does not anticipate any further need for liquidity, because creations and redemptions of Shares generally occur in kind and ordinary expenses are met by cash on hand. Interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the Sponsor's fees and purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to Shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income was $3,819, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $126,802. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income was $6,267, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $108,570. For the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013, interest income was $957, while the Sponsor's fees totaled $19,456. In exchange for a fee based on the net asset value of the Trust, the Sponsor has assumed most of the ordinary expenses incurred by the Trust. In the case of an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, however, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its positions in Index Futures and Collateral Assets to pay such expenses. As of December 31, 2015, the market for Index Futures had not developed significant liquidity and the Trust represented substantially all of the long-side open interest in Index Futures. In addition, it is expected that UBS Securities or its accountholders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in such market. The existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate losses to the Trust if the Trust were required to liquidate its Index Future positions.\nThe Sponsor is unaware of any other trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to the Trust's liquidity needs.\nBecause the Trust trades Index Futures, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of the Index Futures or other assets (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform (credit risk).\nMarket Risk\nThe Trust holds Index Future positions and Collateral Assets to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Future positions. Because of this limited diversification of the Trust's assets, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. The value of the Index Futures is expected to track generally the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, although this correlation may not be exact. The Bloomberg Roll Select CI, in turn, reflects the value of a diversified group of commodities, while also seeking to minimize the effect of contango and maximize the effect of backwardation in connection with periodically switching or rolling\u201d into new futures contracts. The Trust's exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Future market and activities of other market participants.\nCredit Risk\nWhen the Trust purchases or holds Index Futures, it is exposed to the credit risk of a default by the CME's clearing house, which serves as the counterparty to each Index Future position, and of a default by its Clearing FCM. In the case of such a default, the Trust may be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Future positions and Collateral Assets posted as margin. The Trust is also exposed to credit risk as a result of its ownership of U.S. Treasury bills.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Trust does not use and is not expected to use special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust does not have and is not expected to have loan guarantee arrangements or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services that are in the interest of the Trust. While the Trust's exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Trust's financial position.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust's financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust's application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust's accounting policies.\nItem7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nQuantitative Disclosure\nThe Trust is exposed to commodity price risk through the Trust's holdings of Index Futures. The following table provides information about the Trust's futures contract positions, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2015, the Trust's open Index Future positions (long) were as follows:\n\nThe notional amount is calculated using the settlement price for the Index Futures on the CME on December 31, 2015, which was $192.24 per contract, and the $100 multiplier applicable under the contract terms.\nQualitative Disclosure\nAs described herein, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The Index itself is intended to reflect the performance of a diversified group of physical commodities, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust obtains this exposure to commodity prices through the Trust's Index Future positions. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Trust will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, or the value of any Collateral Assets. The Trust's exposure to market risk may be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Future market and activities of other market participants.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with accountants during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nThe duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Sponsor's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trust's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trust's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In making its assessment, the Sponsor's management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on their assessment and those criteria, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of an independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As an emerging growth company, the Trust is exempt from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and accordingly has not engaged any independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust's fourth fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 29, 2016\niShares Commodity Optimized Trust\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities(a)\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014\n\n(a) Previously reported as Statements of Financial Condition.\u201d Please refer to Note 2A.\n(b) Cost of short-term investments: $2,499,967 and $14,437,897, respectively.\n(c) No par value, unlimited amount authorized.\nSee notes to financial statements.\niShares Commodity Optimized Trust\nStatements of Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nand the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013\n\nSee notes to financial statements.\niShares Commodity Optimized Trust\nStatements of Changes in Net Assets(a)\nFor years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nand the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013\n\n(a) Previously reported as Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Capital.\u201d Please refer to Note 2A.\nSee notes to financial statements.\niShares Commodity Optimized Trust\nStatements of Cash Flows\nFor years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nand the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013\n\nSee notes to financial statements.\niShares Commodity Optimized Trust\nSchedules of Investments\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014\nDecember 31, 2015\n\n(a) Rates shown is discount rate paid at the time of purchase.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the open Bloomberg Roll Select CI futures contracts were as follows:\n\nDecember 31, 2014\n\n(a) Rates shown are discount rates paid at the time of purchase.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the open Bloomberg Roll Select CI futures contracts were as follows:\n\nSee notes to financial statements.\niShares Commodity Optimized Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2015\n1 - Organization\nThe iShares Commodity Optimized Trust (the Trust\u201d) is a Delaware statutory trust that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 7, 2011 and commenced operations on August 8, 2013. iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor\u201d). The sole member and manager of the Sponsor is BlackRock Asset Management International Inc., a Delaware corporation. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. is the Trustee\u201d of the Trust. The Trust is governed by the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2014 (the Trust Agreement\u201d), among the Sponsor, the Trustee and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the Delaware Trustee\u201d). The Trust issues units of beneficial interest ( Shares\u201d) representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The Trust holds long positions in exchange-traded index futures contracts of various expirations, or Index Futures\u201d on the Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index (the Bloomberg Roll Select CI\u201d). In order to collateralize its Index Futures positions and to reflect the U.S. Treasury component of the Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Total Return Index (the Index\u201d), the Trust also holds Collateral Assets,\u201d which consist of cash, U.S. Treasury securities or other short-term securities and similar securities that are eligible as margin deposits for those Index Futures positions. The Index Futures held by the Trust are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the CME\u201d).\nThe Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of\nthe Trust's expenses and liabilities.\nThe Trust is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA\u201d) and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC\u201d), and is operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. The Sponsor is an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the Advisor\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC.\nThe Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes and follows the accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, but is not registered, and is not required to be registered, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\n2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n A. Basis of Accounting \nThe following significant accounting policies are consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain statements and captions in the financial statements for the prior year have been changed to conform to the current financial statement presentation. Certain amounts in the financial statements for the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.\n B. Investment in Index Futures \nThe Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities, which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust's expenses and liabilities.\nThe assets of the Trust consist of Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. Index Futures are exchange-traded index futures contracts on the Bloomberg Roll Select CI, and are expected to include contracts of different\nterms and expirations. The Trust is expected to roll out of existing positions in Index Futures and establish new positions in Index Futures on an ongoing basis. When establishing positions in Index Futures, the Trust is required to deposit cash or other Collateral Assets with the broker as initial margin.\u201d On a\ndaily basis, the Trust is obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, cash in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Index Futures positions. Such payments or receipts are known as variation margin and recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When an Index Futures contract is closed, the Trust records a realized gain or loss based on the difference between the value of the Index Futures contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.\nIndex Futures are derivative instruments valued at fair value, which the Trustee has determined to be that day's announced CME settlement price. If there is no announced settlement price for a particular Index Future contract on that day, the Trustee will use the most recently announced CME settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The Trust's derivatives are not designated as hedges, and all changes in the fair value are reflected in the statements of operations.\nFor futures contracts, counterparty credit risk is mitigated because futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange's clearing house acts as central counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts (although customers continue to have credit exposure to the clearing member who holds their account).\nPlease refer to Note 9 for additional disclosures regarding the Trust's investments in futures contracts.\n C. Cash and Cash Equivalents \nThe Trust considers cash and cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Trust had cash and cash equivalents held at brokers of $225,000 and $535,000, respectively, which were posted as margin for the Trust's Index Future positions.\n D. Short-Term Investments \nShort-term investments on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities consist principally of short-term fixed income securities with original maturities of one year or less. These investments are valued at fair value.\n E. Securities Transactions, Income and Expense Recognition \nSecurities transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined using the specific identification method. Other income and expenses are recognized on the accrual basis.\n F. Income Taxes \nThe Trust is treated as a partnership for federal, state and local income tax purposes.\nNo provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements because the Trust is not subject to income taxes. Shareholders are individually responsible for their own tax payments on their proportionate share of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit.\nThe Sponsor has reviewed the tax positions as of December 31, 2015, inclusive of the open tax return years, and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust's financial statements.\n G. Calculation of Net Asset Value \nThe net asset value of the Trust on any given day is obtained by subtracting the Trust's accrued expenses and other liabilities on that day from the value of (1) the Trust's Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets on that day, (2) the interest earned on those assets by the Trust and (3) any other assets of the Trust, as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time) that day. The Trustee determines the net asset value per Share (the NAV\u201d) by dividing the net asset value of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. The NAV is calculated each day on which NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca\u201d) is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time).\n H. Distributions \nInterest and distributions received by the Trust on its assets may be used to acquire additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to shareholders. The Trust is under no obligation to make periodic distributions to shareholders.\n3 - Offering of the Shares\nShares are issued and redeemed continuously in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares in exchange for Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash). Individual investors that are not Authorized Participants cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. The Trust transacts only with registered broker-dealers that have entered into a contractual arrangement with the Trust and the Sponsor governing, among other matters, the creation and redemption of Shares (such authorized broker-dealers are the Authorized Participants\u201d). Authorized Participants may redeem their Shares (as well as Shares on behalf of other investors) at any time before 2:40 p.m. (New York time) on any business day in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares. Redemptions of Shares in exchange for baskets of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash) are treated as sales for financial statement purposes.\n4 - Trust Expenses\nThe Trust is responsible for paying any applicable brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees out of its assets in connection with the roll of Index Futures held by the Trust. These expenses are recorded as brokerage commissions and fees in the Statements of Operations as incurred.\nThe Sponsor pays the amounts that would otherwise be considered the ordinary operating expenses, if any, of the Trust. In return, the Sponsor receives an allocation from the Trust that accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.75% of the net asset value of the Trust, as calculated before deducting fees and expenses based on the value of the Trust's assets.\nThe Sponsor has agreed under the Trust Agreement to pay the following administrative, operational and marketing expenses: (1) the fees of the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor and their respective agents, (2) NYSE Arca listing fees, (3) printing and mailing costs, (4) audit fees, (5) fees for registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (6) tax reporting costs, (7) license fees and (8) legal expenses relating to the Trust of up to $100,000 annually.\n5 - Related Parties\nThe Sponsor, the Trustee and the Advisor are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee's and Advisor's fees are paid by the Sponsor and are not a separate expense of the Trust.\n6 - Indemnification\nThe Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries and agents shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, claim, cost, expense or judgment of any kind whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Trust Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement.\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Advisor provides that the Advisor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, cost, expense or judgment (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Advisory Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\n7 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nIn the normal course of business, the Trust may enter into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.\n8 - Financial Highlights\nThe following financial highlights relate to investment performance and operations for a Share outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013.\n\n(a) Based on average Shares outstanding during each period.\n(b) The amounts reported for a Share outstanding may not accord with the change in aggregate gains and losses on investments for the period due to the timing of Trust Share transactions in relation to the fluctuating fair values of the Trust's underlying investments.\n(c) Based on the change in net asset value of a Share during each period.\n(d) Percentage is not annualized.\n(e) Percentage is annualized.\n9 - Investing in Index Futures\nSubstantially all of the Trust's assets are invested in Index Futures. The Index Futures' settlement value at expiration is based on the value of Bloomberg Roll Select CI at that time. Therefore, the value of the Trust will fluctuate based upon the value of the Bloomberg Roll Select CI and the prices of futures contracts and commodities underlying the Bloomberg Roll Select CI. The commodities markets have historically been extremely volatile. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the average month-end notional amounts of open Index Futures were $15,463,265 and $14,351,951, respectively.\nThe following table shows the variation margin on open futures contracts, by risk exposure category, on the statements of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nThe following table shows the effect of the futures contracts, by risk exposure category, on the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from August 8, 2013 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2013:\n\n10 - Investment Valuation\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trust's policy is to value its investments at fair value.\nInvestments in Index Futures are measured at fair value using the last reported CME settlement price for Index Futures.\nU.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services. In determining the value of a fixed income investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrixes, market transactions in comparable investments, various relationships observed in the market between investments and calculated yield measures.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. Inputs may be based on independent market data ( observable inputs\u201d) or they may be internally developed ( unobservable inputs\u201d). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \n Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and \n Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust's assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments. \nFair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust's net asset value and the prices used by the Trust's underlying index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust's performance and the performance of the Trust's underlying index.\nThe following table summarizes the value of each of the Trust's investments by the fair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\n(a) Shown at the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the contracts.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned in the capacities*

Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- The Trust seeks to track the performance of the Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index before fees and expenses. It holds long positions in index futures contracts and collateral assets to support the futures positions.\n\n2015 Performance\n- The Trust's net asset value decreased from $14.8 million at end of 2014 to $4.8 million at end of 2015, primarily due to redemptions of Trust shares.\n- The 24% decline in net asset value per share was driven by a 23.5% decrease in the settlement price of the index futures. Fees and expenses also contributed to the underperformance versus the index.  \n- Net loss for 2015 was $4.3 million, resulting from net investment losses of $0.1 million and net realized/unrealized losses of $4.2 million on futures contracts.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- The Trust's assets are highly liquid to support creations/redemptions and expenses.  \n- There is limited liquidity in the index futures market that the Trust trades, so large redemptions could force it to liquidate positions at unfavorable prices.\n\nMarket/Credit Risk\n- The Trust's performance is directly linked to the index futures contracts it holds, hence it has significant market risk tied to commodity prices.\n- Credit risk is mitigated by central clearing of the futures contracts. Cash and U.S. Treasuries also have minimal credit risk.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!"}
