MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included as item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in \u201cItem 1A Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet transactions and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog.\nIntroduction\nPrimoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries, which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.\nWe have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical\ncompanies in the western United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length - from several weeks, to as long as 48 months for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues.\nWe recognize revenues and profitability on our contracts depending on the type of contract. For our fixed price, or lump sum, contracts, we record revenue as the work progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis which means that we recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in proportion to the total estimated costs expected to complete the contract. Fixed price contracts may include retainage provisions under which customers withhold a percentage of the contract price until the project is complete. For our unit price, time and material, and cost-plus contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed or services are performed. The \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section below provides additional information on our contracts and revenue recognition practices.\nThe Company segregates its business into three operating segments, which include: The West Construction Services segment (\u201cWest segment\u201d), the East Construction Services segment (\u201cEast segment\u201d) and the Energy segment. The following is a brief description of each of our reportable segments and business activities.\nThe West segment includes the underground and industrial operations and construction services performed by ARB, Inc. (\u201cARB\u201d), ARB Structures, Inc., Rockford Corporation (\u201cRockford\u201d), Q3 Contracting, Inc. (\u201cQ3C\u201d), and Vadnais Trenchless Services, Inc. (\u201cVadnais\u201d). ARB and ARB Structures perform work primarily in California; while, Rockford operates throughout the United States and Q3C operates in Colorado and the upper Midwest United States. The segment also included three joint venture operations. The West segment consists of business headquartered primarily in the western United States.\nThe East segment includes the James Construction Group (\u201cJCG\u201d) Heavy Civil division, the JCG Infrastructure and Maintenance division, BW Primoris, LLC and Cardinal Contractors, Inc. construction business, located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and includes the heavy civil construction and infrastructure and maintenance operations.\nThe Energy segment businesses are located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The segment includes the operations of the Primoris Energy Services (\u201cPES\u201d) pipeline and gas facility construction and maintenance operations, the PES Industrial division, the Surber and Ram-Fab operations and the newly acquired Primoris Aevenia, Inc. (\u201cAevenia\u201d) operations. Additionally, the segment includes the OnQuest, Inc. (\u201cOnQuest\u201d) and OnQuest Canada, ULC operations for the design and installation of high-performance furnaces and heaters for the oil refining, petrochemical and power generation industries.\nThe following table lists the Company's primary operating subsidiaries and their operating segment:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> Subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARB Structures, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Q3C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rockford\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vadnais\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Silva Group (\u201cSilva\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cardinal Contractors, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BW Primoris, LLC (\u201cBWP\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG Heavy Civil Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG Infrastructure and Maintenance Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PES Industrial Division (formerly JCG Industrial Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OnQuest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OnQuest, Canada, ULC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aevenia; acquired February 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPES acquired the net assets of two companies, The Saxon Group (\u201cSaxon\u201d) in 2012 and Force Specialty Services, Inc. (\u201cFSSI\u201d) in 2013. Effective January 1, 2014, Saxon and FSSI were merged into PES along with the Industrial division of JCG. Throughout this Form 10-K, references to FSSI, Saxon and James Industrial are to the divisions of PES for 2015 and 2014, while the references for 2013 are to the entities or divisions.\nARB owned 50% of the Blythe Power Constructors joint venture (\u201cBlythe\u201d) created for the installation of a parabolic trough solar field and steam generation system in California, and results of Blythe's operations have been included as part of the West segment. The Company determined that in accordance with FASB Topic 810, it was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and has consolidated the results of Blythe in its financial statements. The project has been completed, the project warranty expired in May 2015 and dissolution was completed in the third quarter 2015.\nARB owns a 50% interest in two separate joint ventures, both formed in 2015: (1) The Carlsbad Power Constructors joint venture (\u201cCarlsbad\u201d) will engineer and construct a gas-fired power generation facility and (2) a joint venture titled \u201cARB Inc. & B&M Engineering Co.\u201d (\u201cWilmington\u201d) will also engineer and construct a co-generation facility. Both projects are located in the Southern California area. The joint venture operations are included as part of the West segment. As a result of determining that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the two VIE's, the results of the Carlsbad and Wilmington joint ventures are consolidated in the Company's financial statements. The Carlsbad project is expected to be completed in 2017 and the Wilmington project in 2018.\nFinancial information for the joint ventures is presented in \u201cNote 13- Noncontrolling Interests\u201d.\nIn January 2014, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, BW Primoris, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (\u201cBWP\u201d). BWP's goal is to develop water projects, primarily in Texas, that will need the Company's construction services. On January 22, 2014, BWP entered into an agreement to purchase the assets and business of Blaus Wasser, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, for approximately $5 million. BWP has entered into an intercompany construction contract with Cardinal Contractors, Inc. to build a small water treatment facility which will be owned by BWP. Beginning in 2016, the facility will generate revenues through a take-or-pay contract with a West Texas municipal entity. All intercompany revenue, cost and profit of the construction project was eliminated. At December 31, 2015, a total of $13.8 million has been capitalized, including the acquisition costs, as property, plant and equipment.\nIn May 2014, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Vadnais, a California company, which on June 5, 2014, purchased the assets of Vadnais Corporation for $6.4 million. Vadnais Corporation was a general contractor specializing in micro-tunneling in California. The assets purchased were primarily equipment, buildings and land. The purchase included a contingent earnout based on meeting certain operating targets. See \u201cNote 4-Business Combinations\u201d for further information.\nDuring the third quarter 2014, the Company made three small purchases totaling $8.2 million acquiring the net assets of Surber Roustabout, LLC (\u201cSurber\u201d), Ram-Fab, LLC (\u201cRam-Fab\u201d) and Williams Testing, LLC (\u201cWilliams\u201d). Surber and Ram-Fab operate as divisions of PES, and Williams is a division of Cardinal Contractors, Inc. Surber provides general oil and gas related construction activities in Texas; Ram-Fab is a fabricator of custom piping systems located in Arkansas; and Williams provides construction services related to sewer pipeline maintenance, rehabilitation and integrity testing in the Florida market. The Surber and Ram-Fab purchases provided for contingent earnout amounts as discussed in \u201cNote 4- Business Combinations\u201d.\nOn February 28, 2015, the Company acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. for $22.3 million in cash, and established a new entity, Aevenia, which operates as part of the Company's Energy segment. Headquartered in Moorhead, Minnesota, Aevenia is an energy and electrical construction company which specializes in overhead and underground line work, substations, telecom/fiber, and certain other client-specific on-demand call out services. The majority of their work is delivered under unit-price Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSAs\u201d). Aevenia has operations in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa. The Company believes there are opportunities for Aevenia to grow sales by performing in-house work for other Primoris subsidiaries and to expand the Company's offerings to new geographies in the Midwest United States.\nFor some end markets we perform the same services in each of our West, East and Energy segments, while for other end markets, such as poured-in-place parking structures, only one of our segments currently serves the market. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenues over three years derived from our major end-markets, with prior periods conformed to the current year market breakdown:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underground capital projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utility services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Heavy Civil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaterial trends and uncertainties\nWe generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects. The award of these contracts is dependent on many factors, most of which are not within our control. We depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries, the gas utility industry, as well as municipal water and wastewater customers. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, local highway and bridge needs and from the activity level in the oil and gas industry; however, each of these industries and the government agencies periodically are adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.\nWe closely monitor our customers to assess the effect that changes in economic, market and regulatory conditions may have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years, which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near-term. Major fluctuations in market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. The recent significant reduction in the price of oil has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our oil and gas pipeline and roustabout services in the near term, with additional uncertainty resulting over the length of time that prices will remain depressed. We believe that our upstream operations, such as the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations will remain at lower levels for an extended period. We believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services, but the impact of the low oil prices may delay midstream pipeline opportunities. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment also affects the demand for our services, either by increasing our work or delaying projects. For example, the regulatory environment in California may well result in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants while the regulators continue to search for significant renewable resources, but the renewable resources may create a demand for our construction services. Finally, we believe that regulated utility customers will continue to invest in our maintenance and replacement services.\nSeasonality, cyclicality and variability\nOur results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of the Company's work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts affect revenues and profitability since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients' internal budget cycles. As a result, the Company usually experiences higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.\nThe Company is also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and the Company's financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of its financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nTwo examples of the variability resulting from the combination of seasonality and awards of large projects are as follows. First, in the fourth quarter of 2014, revenues were less than those of the second and third quarters of 2014, primarily reflecting the completion of a large power plant project in 2013. Second, the impact from abnormally wet, rainy weather conditions in the second quarter of 2015 resulted in an unusual decrease in revenues compared to the previous year's second quarter.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value\nassumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue recognition\nFixed-price contracts - Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been generated under fixed-price contracts. For fixed-price contracts, we recognize revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, which may result in uneven and irregular results. In the percentage-of-completion method, estimated revenues, estimated contract values and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenues earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenues and profit, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition. To the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have customer approval for a change in scope but for which we do not have an agreed upon price change. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of change order approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.\nWe consider claims to be amounts that we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes. Claims are included in the calculation of revenue when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. Revenue in excess of contract costs from claims is recognized when an agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred.\nOther contract forms - We also use unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts. For these jobs, revenue is recognized primarily based on contractual terms. For example, time and material contract revenues are generally recognized on an input basis, based on labor hours incurred and on purchases made. Similarly, unit price contracts generally recognize revenue on an output based measurement such as the completion of specific units at a specified unit price.\nAt any time, if an estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full at that time. The loss amount is recognized as an \u201caccrued loss provision\u201d and is included in the accrued expenses and other liabilities amount on the balance sheet. For fixed-price contracts, as the percentage-of-completion method is used to calculate revenues, the accrued loss provision is changed so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. The provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was $7.3 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nChanges in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income. These revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified.\nIn all forms of contracts, we estimate collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as revenue, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client's expected budget amount, the client frequently requires an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. In these situations, we may choose to defer recognition of revenue up to the time that the client pays for the services.\nThe caption \u201cCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents unbilled receivables, which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date. Balances represent: (a) unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting which may not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or project milestone, (b) incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursement type contracts, (c) amounts arising from routine lags in billing, or (d) the revenue associated with unapproved change orders or claims when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. For those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date, the excess amounts are included in the caption \u201cBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d.\nIn accordance with applicable terms of certain construction contracts, retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project. Some payments of the retainage may not be received for a significant period after completion of our portion of a project. In some jurisdictions, retainage amounts are deposited into an escrow account.\nValuation of acquired businesses-We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects, inventory and fixed assets (generally consisting of construction equipment) for each acquisition. We determine the fair value of these assets on the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, the Company will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions.\nA liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management's best estimate.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a \u201cmeasurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived intangible Assets-Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated.\nWe account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test.\nAt December 31, 2015, goodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our reporting units as follows (in millions):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> Reporting Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rockford\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Q3C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG (includes Heavy Civil and Infrastructure and Maintenance divisions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PES (includes PES Industrial, PPS, Saxon & Surber divisions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aevenia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OnQuest Canada, ULC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 124.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder ASU 2012-02 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, the Company can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Typically, however, the Company uses the two-step impairment test outlined in ASC Topic 350. First, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination was determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded relating to the goodwill attributed to Cardinal Contractors, Inc., which is a part of the East Segment, and in December 2013, an impairment expense of $0.8 million was recorded relating to FSSI, a part of the Energy segment, for intangible assets for customer relations. There were no other impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nDisruptions to our business, such as end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit, may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future.\nReserve for uninsured risks-Estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks. Significant judgments by us and, where possible, third-party experts are needed in determining probable and/or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change.\nWe self-insure worker's compensation claims up to $0.25 million per claim. We maintained a self-insurance reserve totaling approximately $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 and approximately $22.3 million at December 31, 2014. Claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred. Our accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel. The amount is included in \u201caccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d on our balance sheets. Actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves.\nIncome taxes-We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC Topic 740 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred income tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of our management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available\nevidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination was made.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nLong-Lived Assets-Assets held and used by the Company, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. We perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the future carrying value of our long-lived assets may have differing future fair values.\nMultiemployer plans - Various subsidiaries in the West segment are signatories to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements require that the Company participate in and contribute to a number of multiemployer benefit plans for its union employees at rates determined by the agreements. The trustees for each multiemployer plan determine the eligibility and allocations of contributions and benefit amounts, determine the types of benefits and administer the plan. To the extent that any plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, requires that if the Company were to withdraw from an agreement or if a plan is terminated, we may incur a withdrawal obligation. Since the withdrawal liability is based on estimates of our proportional share of the plan's unfunded vested liability, as calculated by the plan's actuaries, the potential withdrawal obligation may be significant.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association \u201cPLCA\u201d including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the Company's acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. The Company recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.59 million after the acquisition of Q3C, based on information provided by the Plan. The Plan asserted that the PLCA members did not affect a proper withdrawal in 2011, and in May 2014, the Plan asserted that the total liability for the Company was $11.8 million. A legal proceeding commenced, and the United States District Court ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members in 2011 was not effective. The PLCA appealed this decision, but as required by the Plan, the Company began making monthly payments which have totaled $1.83 million through December 31, 2015. These payments have been expensed.\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and ruled that the withdrawal was effective in 2011 as had been asserted by the PLCA. The Company has received a revised withdrawal liability calculation from the Plan at an amount approximately equal to the company's accrual amount. The Company and other members of the PLCA are engaged in arbitration to further reduce the amount owed. The Company is making payments while awaiting the results of the arbitration process. The Company has no plans to withdraw from any other agreements\nLitigation and contingencies-Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defense to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company.

The decrease was primarily from the impact of unusually severe wet weather in the Gulf States during the first half of 2015 and the completion of two large projects in the Energy segment which were not fully replaced in 2015. The historic rainfall in the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter, caused us to suspend operations on various projects and to incur additional costs to recover from the weather conditions. Revenues were also impacted by the delay in certain capital projects as a result of lower oil prices.\nFrom an end-market perspective, our end-market revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $120.8 million for underground capital projects and the industrial end-market revenues decreased by $252.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues increased in our heavy civil end-market by $123.1 million, in our underground utility end-market by $65.9 million, in the engineering end-market by $9.6 million and by $18.0 million in our other end-markets, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue in 2014 grew to $2.1 billion, an increase of $142.0 million, or 7.3% from the prior year. The increase in revenue at the energy segment of $269.8 million, and at the East segment of $59.5 million, was partially offset by a decline in the West segment of $187.3 million. In 2014, the West segment represented 46.2% of total revenue, the Energy segment represented 30.3%, and the East segment was 23.5% of total revenue. Revenue from acquisitions made in 2014 and 2013 added $18.9 million to revenue.\nGross Profit\n2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit decreased by $16.2 million, or 6.9% compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of the 7.5% decrease in revenues and to inefficiencies associated with stopping and starting projects as a result of the weather delays in the Gulf States during the first half of 2015.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 11.4% from 11.3% from the same period in 2014.\n2014 and 2013\nGross profit for 2014 decreased by $20.0 million, or 7.8%, from 2013. As discussed in the segment results below, the decrease in gross profit was $47.3 million in the West segment. Gross profit for the Energy segment increased by $25.9 million and increased by $1.4 million for the East segment. Gross profit from acquisitions made in 2014 and 2013 added $3.0 million to 2014 gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 13.2% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2014 as a result of the large decrease in both revenue and gross profit in the West segment\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n2015 and 2014\nSelling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, office rent and utilities and acquisition costs. For 2015, SG&A expenses were $152.1 million, compared to $132.2 million in 2014, an increase of $19.9 million. Of the increase, $3.9 million was from the 2015 acquisition of Aevenia and $1.6 million of the increase was due to the impact of the 2014 acquisitions of Vadnais, Surber and Ram-Fab. Of the remaining $14.4 million increase, professional fees increased by $9.1 million, we recorded a one-time valuation adjustment for the value of a long-term asset of $2.6 million and the remaining $2.7 million increase represented expenses associated with increased compensation and staffing levels. The majority of the increase in professional fees was an increase in legal fees associated with our collection efforts on the disputed receivables discussed later in this Item and the expenses incurred in our ongoing internal review of the methods used by our subsidiaries to recognize revenue and estimate contingencies for ongoing projects as discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cWe may not be successful in continuing to meet the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on form 10-K. In addition, the increase in professional fees included fees associated with our efforts to improve our documentation of internal controls over financial reporting.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to 7.9% compared to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of both increased expenses and the decrease in revenues in 2015.\n2014 and 2013\nSG&A expenses were $132.2 million in 2014 compared to $130.8 million in 2013. The prior year included one-time expenses of $5.7 million related to impairment costs. Excluding the one-time expenses, SG&A in 2014 increased $7.1 million, or 5.7%, which included an increase of $1.4 million as a result of the 2014 acquisitions of Vadnais, Surber and Ram-Fab. Remaining increases were due to increases in compensation and benefits, marketing and communications expenses and professional fees.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 6.3% for 2014, from 6.7% for 2013.\nOther income and expense\nNon-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from non-consolidated investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere was no income from non-consolidated investments for 2015. For 2014, income from non-consolidated investments was primarily from the sale of our interest of the WesPac Energy non-consolidated joint venture, and for 2013, the loss from non-consolidated investments included an impairment expense and operating loss totalling $5.5 million for the WesPac Energy joint venture, partially offset by a $0.7 million profit from a 49% owned investment, Alvah, Inc.\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the United States dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. Many of our contracts in Calgary, Canada are sold based on United States dollars, but a portion of the work is paid for with Canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of the net reversal of $1.9 million in contingent consideration as Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber missed financial targets contemplated in their respective purchase agreements. Net other expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to adjustments to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Q3C, Surber and Vadnais. Net other income for 2013 was $4.8 million. The major components include $6.5 million as reductions in the liability for contingent consideration since the PPS, Saxon and FSSI acquisitions did not meet the performance targets outlined in their purchase agreements. The income was partially offset by increases of $2.5 million in the fair value of the liabilities for contingent consideration recorded throughout 2013 for acquisitions, including Q3C.\nInterest income is derived from interest earned on excess cash invested primarily in short term U.S. Treasury bills, backed by the federal government, and other investments that may not be backed by the federal government.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million, compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2014 due to increased equipment debt financing and additional borrowing under the Company's agreement for senior secured notes. The increased interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to increases in equipment debt financing, and a full year of interest on a $25 million long-term note drawn-down in July 2013.\nThe weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 2.9%, 3.0% and 3.3%, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income tax decreased $14.7 million to $23.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the decrease in pretax profits. The effective tax rate on income before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 39.19% and 37.77% for the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 39.37% for the year 2015 and 37.96% for 2014. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate was the impact of partially non-deductible per diem expenses, which while decreasing by $5.2 million in 2015, were a greater percentage of pre-tax income.\nOur provision for income tax decreased $6.3 million to $38.6 million for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of decreased pretax profits between the years and a decrease in our effective tax rate.\nSegment Results\nThe following discussion describes the significant factors contributing to the results of our three operating segments. All intersegment revenues and gross profit, which were immaterial, have been eliminated in the following tables.\nWest Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the West segment for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> West Construction Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 913.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 964.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 190.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 and 2014\nWest segment revenue for 2015 decreased by $50.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2014. Revenue declined at the ARB Industrial division by $105.0 million with $80.2 million of the decrease the result of completion of a solar plant project in the Mojave Desert in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by increases at ARB Structures and Q3C totaling $62.2 million. The ARB Structures revenue increase was driven primarily by work on a large parking structure in southern California, and the Q3C revenue increase was attributable primarily to additional work performed for its largest customer, a gas and electric utility, totaling $27.6 million.\nGross profit for the West segment decreased by $13.2 million or 9.2% for 2015 versus 2014. The primary reason was a reduction of gross profit at both ARB Industrial and Rockford totaling $17.4 million, offset by an increase at ARB Underground of $5.1 million. The declines were due to the reduction in revenue at ARB Industrial and the impact of the rain in the second quarter on the pipeline operations of Rockford. The increase realized by ARB Underground was driven largely by increased MSA work performed for a major public gas and electric utility customer under its Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.3% in 2015 compared to 14.9% in 2014, still consistent with historical ratios. This decline in margin is largely attributable to Rockford's margin decrease from 11.6% in 2014 to 8.6% in 2015 reflecting a reduced level of work in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the rainy weather on a large diameter pipeline job in the Houston, TX area.\n2014 and 2013\nWest segment revenue in 2014 decreased by $187.3 million, or 16.3%, compared to 2013. Revenue declined at Rockford by $175.6 million primarily as a result of the completion of several large projects in 2013 and a $102 million decrease for a customer in the Marcellus shale region. Revenue decreased by $41.8 million at the ARB Underground division primarily due to reduced revenue of $23.2 million from traditional MSA customers, a decline of $40.1 million for one-time projects completed in 2013 partially offset by an increase in pipeline integrity work for a large gas utility customer. ARB Industrial division revenues declined by $21.8 million as a result of an $84.3 million decrease from the substantial completion of a major power plant project in 2013. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $53.2 million for construction of a solar plant project in the Mojave Desert in 2014. Finally, revenue at Q3C increased $62.2 million compared to 2013 due primarily to increase in work for a large utility located in the north central United States.\nGross profit for the West segment decreased by $47.3 million or 24.8%. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction of gross profit at ARB of $54.3 million. The declines were due to a combination of the close out of a major power plant project, the substantial completion of the Blythe joint venture project, the mix of MSA jobs at ARB Underground and the decline in revenue including $4.4 million less equipment cost absorption by the jobs as a result of the lower activity levels in 2014 compared to 2013. Gross profit at Rockford decreased by $5.1 million while gross profit at Q3C increased by $13.5 million, with the revenue at the operating units serving as the primary driver of gross profit changes.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.9% in 2014 compared to 16.6% in 2013. The percentage in 2013 was higher than our historical percentages, which have ranged from 13% to 16% of revenue as a result of the substantial completion in 2013 of a power plant project by the ARB Industrial division. In addition, ARB Industrial recorded revenue of $29.5 million in 2013 and revenue of $82.6 million in 2014 for construction services at a large solar project in the Mojave Desert. Because of uncertainty as to collectability at the end of the cost-reimbursable project, we recorded revenues equal to cost for this project. Excluding the revenue and cost of this project, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have been 16.3% for 2014 compared to 17.0% for 2013.\nEast Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the East segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> East Construction Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 612.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 430.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 and 2014\nEast segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $122.2 million, or 25.0% from 2014. The increase was due primarily to JCG's infrastructure and maintenance division work at a large petrochemical facility project in Louisiana.\nEast segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $16.8 million, or 65.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was due primarily to the increased revenue for the JCG infrastructure and maintenance division petrochemical project in Louisiana. Gross profit decreased at both JCG's heavy civil division and Cardinal Contractors. Gross profit for JCG heavy civil division projects decreased by $15.3 million primarily from delays at the Texas DOT projects in the Belton, TX area, and Cardinal Contractors gross profits decreased by $4.9 million, primarily from reduced margins for two Texas wastewater projects.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 6.9 % in 2015 compared to 5.3% in 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue for the East segment increased by $59.5 million, or 13.8% from 2013. Of the increase, $66.1 million was at JCG's heavy civil and infrastructure and maintenance divisions due primarily to increases of $42.8 million in Texas DOT revenue and an increase of $40.2 million in Mississippi DOT revenue. The increases were partially offset by a reduction of $19.1 million in Louisiana DOT revenue. Additionally, Cardinal Contractor's revenue decreased by $8.9 million, reflecting decreased work in the wastewater facility market in Florida.\nGross profit for the East segment increased by $1.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2013. The increased percentage was lower than the revenue growth primarily as a result of reduced gross profit of $1.9 million for JCG heavy civil projects offset by increases of $1.8 million at JCG's infrastructure and maintenance divisions and $0.6 million for Cardinal Contractor's projects. Heavy civil experienced a $7.9 million decrease in gross profit due to both the impact of the lower Louisiana DOT revenues and reduced gross profit on Texas DOT work. This decrease was partially offset by gross profit increases of $5.6 million in other heavy civil work, primarily on Mississippi DOT projects.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.3 % in 2014 compared to 5.6% in 2013 primarily as a result of the lower gross profit Texas and Louisiana heavy civil projects.\nEnergy Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Energy segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 403.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 632.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 362.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 and 2014\nRevenue for the Energy segment decreased by $228.6 million, or 36.2% from 2014. The PES Industrial division revenue decreased by $116.0 million, primarily due to completion of a fertilizer plant project in 2014, and the impact of the unusually severe rainy weather during the first half of the year, which delayed our ability to start work for a chemical plant project in Louisiana. PES's pipeline division revenue decreased by $113.9 million as a result of completion of a pipeline project in 2014. For the PES Saxon division, revenue decreased by $36.6 million as a result of a 2014 completion of a project in the Houston Ship Channel, partially offset by increases from two projects in Pennsylvania. OnQuest and OnQuest Canada revenue in 2015 increased by $9.6 million as a result of an LNG project in Florida. Revenue for Aevenia, acquired on February 28, 2015, was $23.7 million.\nGross profit for the Energy segment decreased by $19.8 million, or 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. The PES industrial division, PES pipeline division and the PES Saxon division gross profit decreased $27.1 million as a result of the reduction in revenue. PES's Specialty division gross profit increased $3.6 million as a result of the completion of a chilled water project in Texas. Aevenia's gross profit was $2.4 million.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7% in 2015 compared to 10.6% in 2014. The increase was primarily the result of two offsetting factors. The first was due to the effect of zero margin work on a large pipeline project at the PES Pipeline division in 2014 and it's resulting lower prior year gross profit margin percentage. Offsetting this was reduced 2015 gross profits caused by the heavy rains during the first half of 2015 and decreased labor efficiency rates.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue for the Energy segment increased by $269.8 million, or 74.5% from 2013. The PES Industrial division revenue increased by $129.0 million primarily from work activity at petrochemical facilities in south Louisiana. PES's PPS division revenue increased by $85.5 million as a result of increased revenues from capital projects. PES's Saxon division revenue increased by $17.1\nmillion and OnQuest and OnQuest Canada revenue in 2014 increased by $21.5 million as a result of additional revenue from construction of a micro LNG facility in 2014.\nGross profit for the Energy segment increased by $25.9 million, or 63.1%, compared to 2013. The PES Industrial division gross profit increased $14.6 million primarily due to the division's increased revenues. PES's PPS division gross profit increased $4.1 million due to increased revenues and the Saxon division gross profit increased $3.7 million as a result of increased revenues and improved profit margins compared to 2013. OnQuest and OnQuest Canada profit margins in 2014 increased by $1.5 million due to increased revenues.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.6% in 2014 compared to 11.3% in 2013 primarily as a result of the reduced margins at PES's PPS division. Similar to ARB Industrial, PPS recorded revenues equal to cost for a large pipeline project for which we have concerns about collectability of the full contractual amount. In 2013, PPS recorded revenue of $9.2 million and in 2014, PPS recorded revenue of $121.2 million for the project. Excluding the revenue of this project, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have been 13.0% for 2014 compared to 11.6% for 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Needs\nLiquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund business operations and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our net cash flow. If needed, we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis. We may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock, convertible notes, term debt or increasing our credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $161.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $170.5 million at December 31, 2014. We anticipate that our cash and investments on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our operating needs, our planned capital expenditures and our ability to grow for at least the next twelve months.\nThe construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. Historically, we have invested an amount that approximated the sum of depreciation and amortization expenses plus proceeds from equipment sales. In 2015, capital expenditures were approximately $67.1 million. For 2015, the amount of depreciation, amortization and equipment sales was approximately $75.1 million. Capital expenses are expected to total $55 to $60 million for 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash flows during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (102.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (97.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (56.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe source of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions received from non-consolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other than temporary impairment expense for non-consolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill/Intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net deferred taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (88.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (45.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (38.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (44.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2015 of $48.4 million increased by $12.3 million compared to 2014. This increase was caused by the $6.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization, the reduced provision for income taxes of $14.7 million, offset by the decrease in operating income of $36.0 million and due to the $46.3 million net changes in assets and liabilities in 2015 compared to the net change of $88.7 million in 2014.\nThe components of the $46.3 million change in assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:\n\u00b7 an increase of $2.1 million in customer retention deposits;\n\u00b7 a decrease of $19.5 million in accounts receivable, primarily as a result of a decrease of $17.7 million in amounts retained by customers as we have completed major projects. At December 31, 2015, accounts receivable represented 28.3% of our total assets compared to 30.4% at the end of 2014. In general, we continue to maintain an excellent collection history, and we have certain lien rights that can provide additional security for collections. However, as outlined in the section \u201cReceivable Collection Actions\u201d, we are in dispute resolution with two customers with a total receivable amount $50.8 million, or 16.0% of our total accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015;\n\u00b7 an increase of $47.5 million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Increases associated with the time lag from when revenues were earned until the customer can be billed were approximately $23.6 million for ARB, primarily for two large utility customers, and $22.6 million for JCG, primarily for public agency heavy civil projects which require inspector approval prior to billing;\n\u00b7 a decrease in inventory and other current assets of $4.9 million primarily as a result of the 2015 utilization of the prior year tax receivable;\n\u00b7 accounts payable decreased by $5.1 million, primarily impacted by the timing of vendor payments;\n\u00b7 a net decrease of $19.6 million in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings reflecting the timing of work progression and billings;\n\u00b7 a decrease of $6.7 million in contingent earn-out liabilities, from a payment of $5.0 million made in March 2015 and the reduction of the earn-out liability as a result of the Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber operations not meeting targets outlined in their purchase agreements; and\n\u00b7 a net increase of $11.7 million in accrued expenses, mainly due to an increase in workers compensation reserves.\nDuring the twelve months of 2015, we paid $18.7 million for income taxes compared to $57.6 million in the same period of the previous year. The reduction in net cash tax payments in 2015 was the result of a decrease in the Company's current tax provision and the utilization of significant prepayments from 2014.\nInvesting activities\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures - cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures - financed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe purchased property and equipment for $67.1 million, $88.0 million and $89.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally for our construction activities. We believe the ownership of equipment is generally preferable to renting equipment on a project-by-project basis, as ownership helps to ensure the equipment is available for our workloads when needed. In addition, ownership has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs.\nWe periodically sell equipment, typically to update our fleet. We received proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $9.9 million, $5.8 million and $7.9 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we did not purchase any short-term investments, while we invested $33.8 million and $23.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in short-term investments. We sold short-term investments amounting to $31.0 million, $21.5 million and $7.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Short-term investments consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury bills with various financial institutions.\nWe used $22.3 million in cash for the Aevenia acquisition, $14.6 million in cash for the Vadnais and Surber/Ram-Fab/Williams acquisitions in 2014 and $2.3 million in cash for the FSSI acquisition in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $21.8 million in 2015. Significant transactions impacting cash flows from financing activities included:\n\u00b7 $50.3 million in new and refinanced notes secured by our equipment and by a mortgage note on two buildings;\n\u00b7 $25.0 million in new debt under the Company's Note Agreement;\n\u00b7 $43.9 million in repayment of long-term debt and the repayment of $1.3 million in capital leases;\n\u00b7 $0.03 million in payments of accumulated earnings to the Blythe non-controlling interest holder;\n\u00b7 Dividend payments of $9.8 million to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015; and\n\u00b7 $1.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of 96,828 shares of common stock purchased by the participants in the Primoris Long-term Retention Plan.\nDebt Activities\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a revolving credit facility, as amended on December 12, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with The PrivateBank and Trust Company, as administrative agent (the \u201cAdministrative Agent\u201d) and co-lead arranger, The Bank of the West, as co-lead arranger, and IBERIABANK Corporation, Branch Banking and Trust Company and UMB Bank, N.A. (the \u201cLenders\u201d). The Credit Agreement is a $125 million revolving credit facility whereby the Lenders agree to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to the $125 million committed amount. The termination date of the Credit Agreement is December 28, 2017.\nThe principal amount of any loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin as specified in the Credit Agreement (based on the Company's senior debt to EBITDA ratio as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement), or (ii) the Base Rate (which is the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or (b) the prime rate as announced by the Administrative Agent). Quarterly non-use fees, letter of credit fees and administrative agent fees are payable at rates specified in the Credit Agreement.\nThe principal amount of any loan drawn under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part, with a minimum prepayment of $5 million, at any time, potentially subject to make-whole provisions.\nThe Credit Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants for facilities of this type, as discussed below.\nCommercial letters of credit outstanding were $12.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $4.7 million at December 31, 2014. Other than commercial letters of credit, there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2015 was $112.9 million.\nSenior Secured Notes and Shelf Agreement\nOn December 28, 2012, the Company entered into a $50 million Senior Secured Notes purchase (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and a $25 million private shelf agreement (the \u201cNotes Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, The Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and certain Prudential affiliates (the \u201cNoteholders\u201d). On June 3, 2015, the Notes Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance of additional notes of up to $75 million over the next three year period ending June 3, 2018 (\u201cAdditional Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe Senior Notes amount was funded on December 28, 2012. The Senior Notes are due December 28, 2022 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.65%, paid quarterly in arrears. Annual principal payments of $7.1 million are required from December 28, 2016 through December 28, 2021 with a final payment due on December 28, 2022. The principal amount may be prepaid, with a minimum prepayment of $5 million, at any time, subject to make-whole provisions.\nOn July 25, 2013, the Company drew $25 million available under the Notes Agreement. The notes are due July 25, 2023 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.85% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from July 25, 2017 with a final payment due on July 25, 2023.\nOn November 9, 2015, the Company drew $25 million available under the Additional Senior Notes Agreement. The notes are due November 9, 2025 and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.6% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from November 9, 2019 with a final payment due on November 9, 2025.\nLoans made under both the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement are secured by our assets, including, among others, our cash, inventory, goods, equipment (excluding equipment subject to permitted liens) and accounts receivable. All of our domestic subsidiaries have issued joint and several guaranties in favor of the Lenders and Noteholders for all amounts under the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement.\nBoth the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement contain various restrictive and financial covenants including among others, minimum tangible net worth, senior debt/EBITDA ratio, debt service coverage requirements and a minimum balance for unencumbered net book value for fixed assets. In addition, the agreements include restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event the Company disposes more than 20% of its total assets.\nThe Company was in compliance with the covenants for the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement at December 31, 2015.\nCanadian Credit Facility\nThe Company has a demand credit facility for $8.0 million in Canadian dollars with a Canadian bank for purposes of issuing commercial letters of credit in Canada. The credit facility has an annual renewal and provides for the issuance of commercial letters of credit for a term of up to five years. The facility provides for an annual fee of 1% for any issued and outstanding commercial letters of credit. Letters of credit can be denominated in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, letters of credit outstanding totaled $2.2 million and $2.6 million in Canadian dollars, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the available borrowing capacity was $5.8 million in Canadian dollars. The credit facility contains a working capital restrictive covenant for our Canadian subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. At December 31, 2015, OnQuest Canada, ULC was in compliance with the covenant.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $275.3 million of outstanding long-term debt and capital lease obligations. There were no short-term borrowings.\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real property leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real property leases-related parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 338.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The interest amount represents interest payments for our fixed rate debt assuming that principal payments are made as originally scheduled.\nThe table does not include obligations under multi-employer pension plans in which some of our employees participate. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates are generally specified in our collective bargaining agreements, and contributions are made to the plans based on employee payrolls. Our obligations for future periods cannot be determined because we cannot predict the number of employees that we will employ at any given time nor the plans in which they may participate.\nWe may also be required to make additional contributions to multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these contributions will be determined based on our union payroll. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules for multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers. The amounts of additional funds that we may be obligated to contribute cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the table above.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (\u201cPLCA\u201d), including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the Company's acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. The Company recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C, based on information provided by the Plan. The Plan asserted that the PLCA members did not affect a proper withdrawal in 2011, and in May 2014, the Plan asserted that the total liability for the Company was $11.8 million. A legal proceeding commenced, and a United States District Court ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members in 2011 was not effective. The PLCA appealed this decision, but as required by the Plan, the Company began making monthly payments which have totaled $1.8 million through December 31, 2015. These payments have been expensed.\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and ruled that the withdrawal was effective in 2011 as had been asserted by the PLCA. The Company has received a revised withdrawal liability calculation from the Plan at an amount approximately equal to the company's accrual amount. The Company and other members of the PLCA are engaged in arbitration to further reduce the amount owed. The Company is making payments while awaiting the results of the arbitration process. The Company has no plans to withdraw from any other agreements.\nWe have also excluded from the table any interest and fees associated with letters of credit and commitment fees under our credit facility since these amounts are unknown and variable.\nRelated Party Transactions\nPrimoris has entered into leasing transactions with Stockdale Investment Group, Inc. (\u201cSIGI\u201d). Brian Pratt, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and our largest stockholder, holds a majority interest and is the chairman, president and chief executive officer and a director of SIGI. John M. Perisich, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, is secretary of SIGI.\nPrimoris leases properties from SIGI at the following locations:\n1. Bakersfield, California (lease expires October 2022)\n2. Pittsburg, California (lease expires April 2023)\n3. San Dimas, California (lease expires March 2019)\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $0.83 million, $0.86 million and $0.91 million, respectively, in lease payments to SIGI for the use of these properties.\nPrimoris leases a property from Roger Newnham, a former owner and current manager of our subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. The property is located in Calgary, Canada. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 Primoris paid $0.25 million, $0.29 million and $0.30 million, respectively, in lease payments. The current term of the lease will expire on December 31, 2017.\nPrimoris leases a property from Lemmie Rockford, one of the Rockford sellers, which commenced November 1, 2011. The property is located in Toledo, Washington. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Primoris paid $0.09 million each year, in lease payments. The lease will expire in January 2017.\nPrimoris leases a property from Quality RE Partners, owned by three of the Q3C selling shareholders, of whom two are current employees, including Jay Osborn, an operations president in the West Construction segment. The property is located in Little\nCanada, Minnesota. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $0.27 million, $0.26 million and $0.26 million, respectively, in lease payments to Quality RE Partners. The lease expires in October 2022. In addition, in November 2015, Q3C purchased construction equipment at fair value from Quality RE Partners for $0.6 million. Q3C also leased construction equipment from Mr. Osborn during 2015 for $0.04 million and subsequently purchased the equipment at fair value for $0.145 million.\nWe believe that the amounts that we pay for the leases approximate terms that we could obtain from independent third parties. In addition, related party transactions, any new leases, extensions of lease terms and changes in lease terms or amounts must be approved in advance by the independent directors of the Board of Directors Audit Committee.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs is common in our industry, we enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected on our balance sheet. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangement with variable interest entities. The following represent transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered material off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\u00b7 Letters of credit issued under our lines of credit. At December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit outstanding of $13.7 million, primarily for international projects in our Energy segment, a large domestic pipeline project and for providing security to our insurance carriers. These letters of credit are used by some of our carriers to ensure reimbursement for amounts that they are disbursing on our behalf, such as beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance program. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post a letter of credit to ensure payments to our subcontractors or guarantee performance under our contracts. Letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement and Canadian Credit Facility. If these letters of credit were drawn on by the beneficiary, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, and we may be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit.\n\u00b7 We enter into non-cancellable operating leases for some of our facilities, equipment and vehicles, including leases with related parties. At December 31, 2015, equipment operating leases had a remaining commitment of $14.2 million and facility rental commitments were $18.8 million.\n\u00b7 Employment agreements which provide for compensation and benefits under certain circumstances and which may contain a change of control clause. We may be obligated to make payments under the terms of these agreements.\n\u00b7 In the ordinary course of our business, we may be required by our customers to post surety bid or completion bonds in connection with services that we provide. At December 31, 2015, we had $1.48 billion in outstanding bonds. We do not believe that it is likely that we would have to fund material claims under our surety arrangements.\n\u00b7 Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions. In most instances, these agreements require that we contribute to multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. For many plans, the contributions are determined annually and required future contributions cannot be determined since contribution rates depend on the total number of union employees and actuarial calculations based on the demographics of all participants. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Amendments Act of 1980, subject employers to potential liabilities in the event of an employer's complete or partial withdrawal of an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules that are classified as \u201cendangered\u201d, \u201cseriously endangered\u201d, or \u201ccritical\u201d status. As discussed in Note 18 - \u201cMultiemployer Plans\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have recognized a withdrawal liability for one plan. We currently do not anticipate withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plans. Withdrawal liabilities or requirements for increased future contributions could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity; and\n\u00b7 Other guarantees that we make from time to time, such as guaranteeing the obligations of our subsidiaries.\nReceivable Collection Actions\nAs all construction contractors, we negotiate payments with our customers from time to time, and we may encounter delays in receiving payments from our customers. However, in 2014, we encountered unusual situations with two contracts. In one instance, ARB Industrial performed work on a solar plant in the Mojave Desert. Based on our concerns about eventual collectability for the cost-reimbursable contract and in spite of many assurances of payment from the owner, we chose to recognize revenue equal to cost. At the end of the project, the owner chose not to pay the final amounts due totaling $32.9 million. We are currently engaged in\nalternative dispute resolution as required by the contract. The owner has bonded around the liens that we filed, and we believe that action will enhance collectability of amounts due at the end of the dispute process.\nIn addition, a division of PES constructed a large capital pipeline for a customer in Texas. During the early stages of the project, we became concerned that the customer would not pay us for ancillary items as we believe is required by the contract. As a result of our concerns about eventual collectability, we chose to recognize revenue equal to cost. We have initiated legal action and filed liens to collect our $17.9 million receivable.\nThe Company has specific reserves of approximately $26 million for these two projects included in \u201cbillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d. While we believe that in both instances we are owed the full amount of the receivable, there can be no guarantee of the final amount that we receive or the timing of a resolution of the two matters.\n2016 Outlook\nWe believe that we have market growth opportunities in 2016 and well into 2017 even if the price of oil remains at a depressed level for 2016. We do note that the increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental requirements for many of our client's infrastructure improvements and impact of the reduced oil price create uncertainty as to the timing of some of our opportunities. We believe that Primoris has the financial and operational strength to meet these short-term challenges, and we continue to be optimistic about longer-term opportunities. Specifically, our view of the outlook for our major end markets currently is as follows:\n\u00b7 Construction of petroleum, natural gas, and natural gas liquid pipelines - We expect that at the current oil price, activities in most if not all of the shale basins will be reduced or eliminated significantly reducing any upstream work such as gathering lines and petroleum transport pipelines for the near future. If production from the shale formations continues to increase in the near future, the current disconnect between production and processing locations provides opportunities for our underground construction operations serving midstream companies, primarily Rockford, ARB Underground and Primoris Pipeline & Maintenance groups. We expect that the efforts by gas utilities to move shale gas from the Marcellus region to Florida and other Atlantic states will continue and will provide significant opportunity for Rockford over the next 2-3 years.\n\u00b7 Inspection, maintenance and replacement of gas utility infrastructure -We expect that continuing safety enhancements to the gas utility infrastructure will provide continuing opportunities for our ARB Underground operations, especially in California, as well as Q3C in the Midwest. We also expect that ongoing gas utility repair and maintenance opportunities will continue to grow benefiting our Q3C and PES groups.\n\u00b7 Construction of natural gas-fired power plants and heavy industrial plants - We expect continued construction opportunities for both base-load and peak shaving power plants; however, we are aware that concerns expressed in California that power plants are not \u201cacceptable\u201d for environmental reasons may impact the timing of near term construction opportunities. We believe that based on continuing population growth, the intermittency of renewable power resources and the environmental requirements associated with using ocean water for cooling, power plants will be needed in spite of vocal opposition to \u201cnon-green\u201d sources. In addition, the current low price of natural gas could result in the conversion of coal-fired power plants and conversion and expansion at chemical plants and industrial facilities in other parts of the United States. These opportunities would benefit our ARB Industrial group and PES Industrial group.\n\u00b7 Construction of alternative energy facilities, wind farms, solar energy - We anticipate continued construction opportunities as state governments remain committed to renewable power standards, primarily benefitting ARB Industrial and to a lesser degree our PES group.\n\u00b7 Transportation infrastructure construction opportunities - We believe that passing of longer term highway funding by the federal government in 2015 and voter approval of a highway funding proposition 7 in Texas will provide increased opportunity for our heavy civil and highway groups especially in Texas. We expect that opportunities in the Louisiana market may improve but will remain at depressed levels except for specific programs. This market primarily impacts the operations of JCG.\n\u00b7 Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities-We believe the LNG on-purpose opportunities for rail, barge, and other transportation needs will continue to grow, albeit at a slow pace. This market will primarily impact our OnQuest and PES groups. We further believe the existing large scale LNG export facilities currently being planned will require services that will benefit our PES and JCG groups for field services.\nPlease note that our 2016 outlook and 2016 financial results could be adversely impacted by many factors including those discussed in Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This \u201c2016 Outlook\u201d consists of forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the cautions about forward looking statements found at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBacklog\nFor companies in the construction industry, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We define backlog is defined as a combination of: (1) anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts for which we have known revenue amounts for fixed price and fixed unit price contracts (\u201cFixed Backlog\u201d), and (2) the estimated revenues on MSA's for the next four quarters (\u201cMSA Backlog\u201d). We normally do not include time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts in the calculation of backlog, when their ultimate revenue amount is difficult to estimate in advance.\nThe two components of backlog, Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog, are detailed below.\nFixed Backlog\nFixed Backlog by operating segment and the changes in Fixed Backlog for the periods ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows, in millions:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beginning Fixed\nBacklog at\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

The backlog estimates include amounts from estimated MSA revenues, but our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs. Any of our contracts, MSA, fixed price or fixed unit price, may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements or project specific issues. Future revenues from projects completed under time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable-plus-fee contracts may not be included in our estimated backlog amount.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included as item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in \u201cItem 1A Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet transactions and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog.\nIntroduction\nPrimoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries, which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.\nWe have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical\ncompanies in the western United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length - from several weeks, to as long as 48 months for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues.\nWe recognize revenues and profitability on our contracts depending on the type of contract. For our fixed price, or lump sum, contracts, we record revenue as the work progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis which means that we recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in proportion to the total estimated costs expected to complete the contract. Fixed price contracts may include retainage provisions under which customers withhold a percentage of the contract price until the project is complete. For our unit price, time and material, and cost-plus contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed or services are performed. The \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section below provides additional information on our contracts and revenue recognition practices.\nThe Company segregates its business into three operating segments, which include: The West Construction Services segment (\u201cWest segment\u201d), the East Construction Services segment (\u201cEast segment\u201d) and the Energy segment. The following is a brief description of each of our reportable segments and business activities.\nThe West segment includes the underground and industrial operations and construction services performed by ARB, Inc. (\u201cARB\u201d), ARB Structures, Inc., Rockford Corporation (\u201cRockford\u201d), Q3 Contracting, Inc. (\u201cQ3C\u201d), and Vadnais Trenchless Services, Inc. (\u201cVadnais\u201d). ARB and ARB Structures perform work primarily in California; while, Rockford operates throughout the United States and Q3C operates in Colorado and the upper Midwest United States. The segment also included three joint venture operations. The West segment consists of business headquartered primarily in the western United States.\nThe East segment includes the James Construction Group (\u201cJCG\u201d) Heavy Civil division, the JCG Infrastructure and Maintenance division, BW Primoris, LLC and Cardinal Contractors, Inc. construction business, located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and includes the heavy civil construction and infrastructure and maintenance operations.\nThe Energy segment businesses are located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The segment includes the operations of the Primoris Energy Services (\u201cPES\u201d) pipeline and gas facility construction and maintenance operations, the PES Industrial division, the Surber and Ram-Fab operations and the newly acquired Primoris Aevenia, Inc. (\u201cAevenia\u201d) operations. Additionally, the segment includes the OnQuest, Inc. (\u201cOnQuest\u201d) and OnQuest Canada, ULC operations for the design and installation of high-performance furnaces and heaters for the oil refining, petrochemical and power generation industries.\nThe following table lists the Company's primary operating subsidiaries and their operating segment:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> Subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARB Structures, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Q3C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rockford\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vadnais\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Silva Group (\u201cSilva\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cardinal Contractors, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BW Primoris, LLC (\u201cBWP\u201d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG Heavy Civil Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG Infrastructure and Maintenance Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PES Industrial Division (formerly JCG Industrial Division)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OnQuest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OnQuest, Canada, ULC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aevenia; acquired February 28, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPES acquired the net assets of two companies, The Saxon Group (\u201cSaxon\u201d) in 2012 and Force Specialty Services, Inc. (\u201cFSSI\u201d) in 2013. Effective January 1, 2014, Saxon and FSSI were merged into PES along with the Industrial division of JCG. Throughout this Form 10-K, references to FSSI, Saxon and James Industrial are to the divisions of PES for 2015 and 2014, while the references for 2013 are to the entities or divisions.\nARB owned 50% of the Blythe Power Constructors joint venture (\u201cBlythe\u201d) created for the installation of a parabolic trough solar field and steam generation system in California, and results of Blythe's operations have been included as part of the West segment. The Company determined that in accordance with FASB Topic 810, it was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and has consolidated the results of Blythe in its financial statements. The project has been completed, the project warranty expired in May 2015 and dissolution was completed in the third quarter 2015.\nARB owns a 50% interest in two separate joint ventures, both formed in 2015: (1) The Carlsbad Power Constructors joint venture (\u201cCarlsbad\u201d) will engineer and construct a gas-fired power generation facility and (2) a joint venture titled \u201cARB Inc. & B&M Engineering Co.\u201d (\u201cWilmington\u201d) will also engineer and construct a co-generation facility. Both projects are located in the Southern California area. The joint venture operations are included as part of the West segment. As a result of determining that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the two VIE's, the results of the Carlsbad and Wilmington joint ventures are consolidated in the Company's financial statements. The Carlsbad project is expected to be completed in 2017 and the Wilmington project in 2018.\nFinancial information for the joint ventures is presented in \u201cNote 13- Noncontrolling Interests\u201d.\nIn January 2014, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, BW Primoris, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (\u201cBWP\u201d). BWP's goal is to develop water projects, primarily in Texas, that will need the Company's construction services. On January 22, 2014, BWP entered into an agreement to purchase the assets and business of Blaus Wasser, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, for approximately $5 million. BWP has entered into an intercompany construction contract with Cardinal Contractors, Inc. to build a small water treatment facility which will be owned by BWP. Beginning in 2016, the facility will generate revenues through a take-or-pay contract with a West Texas municipal entity. All intercompany revenue, cost and profit of the construction project was eliminated. At December 31, 2015, a total of $13.8 million has been capitalized, including the acquisition costs, as property, plant and equipment.\nIn May 2014, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Vadnais, a California company, which on June 5, 2014, purchased the assets of Vadnais Corporation for $6.4 million. Vadnais Corporation was a general contractor specializing in micro-tunneling in California. The assets purchased were primarily equipment, buildings and land. The purchase included a contingent earnout based on meeting certain operating targets. See \u201cNote 4-Business Combinations\u201d for further information.\nDuring the third quarter 2014, the Company made three small purchases totaling $8.2 million acquiring the net assets of Surber Roustabout, LLC (\u201cSurber\u201d), Ram-Fab, LLC (\u201cRam-Fab\u201d) and Williams Testing, LLC (\u201cWilliams\u201d). Surber and Ram-Fab operate as divisions of PES, and Williams is a division of Cardinal Contractors, Inc. Surber provides general oil and gas related construction activities in Texas; Ram-Fab is a fabricator of custom piping systems located in Arkansas; and Williams provides construction services related to sewer pipeline maintenance, rehabilitation and integrity testing in the Florida market. The Surber and Ram-Fab purchases provided for contingent earnout amounts as discussed in \u201cNote 4- Business Combinations\u201d.\nOn February 28, 2015, the Company acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. for $22.3 million in cash, and established a new entity, Aevenia, which operates as part of the Company's Energy segment. Headquartered in Moorhead, Minnesota, Aevenia is an energy and electrical construction company which specializes in overhead and underground line work, substations, telecom/fiber, and certain other client-specific on-demand call out services. The majority of their work is delivered under unit-price Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSAs\u201d). Aevenia has operations in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa. The Company believes there are opportunities for Aevenia to grow sales by performing in-house work for other Primoris subsidiaries and to expand the Company's offerings to new geographies in the Midwest United States.\nFor some end markets we perform the same services in each of our West, East and Energy segments, while for other end markets, such as poured-in-place parking structures, only one of our segments currently serves the market. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenues over three years derived from our major end-markets, with prior periods conformed to the current year market breakdown:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underground capital projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utility services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Heavy Civil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaterial trends and uncertainties\nWe generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects. The award of these contracts is dependent on many factors, most of which are not within our control. We depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries, the gas utility industry, as well as municipal water and wastewater customers. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, local highway and bridge needs and from the activity level in the oil and gas industry; however, each of these industries and the government agencies periodically are adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.\nWe closely monitor our customers to assess the effect that changes in economic, market and regulatory conditions may have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years, which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near-term. Major fluctuations in market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. The recent significant reduction in the price of oil has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our oil and gas pipeline and roustabout services in the near term, with additional uncertainty resulting over the length of time that prices will remain depressed. We believe that our upstream operations, such as the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations will remain at lower levels for an extended period. We believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services, but the impact of the low oil prices may delay midstream pipeline opportunities. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment also affects the demand for our services, either by increasing our work or delaying projects. For example, the regulatory environment in California may well result in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants while the regulators continue to search for significant renewable resources, but the renewable resources may create a demand for our construction services. Finally, we believe that regulated utility customers will continue to invest in our maintenance and replacement services.\nSeasonality, cyclicality and variability\nOur results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of the Company's work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts affect revenues and profitability since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients' internal budget cycles. As a result, the Company usually experiences higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.\nThe Company is also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and the Company's financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of its financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nTwo examples of the variability resulting from the combination of seasonality and awards of large projects are as follows. First, in the fourth quarter of 2014, revenues were less than those of the second and third quarters of 2014, primarily reflecting the completion of a large power plant project in 2013. Second, the impact from abnormally wet, rainy weather conditions in the second quarter of 2015 resulted in an unusual decrease in revenues compared to the previous year's second quarter.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value\nassumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue recognition\nFixed-price contracts - Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been generated under fixed-price contracts. For fixed-price contracts, we recognize revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, which may result in uneven and irregular results. In the percentage-of-completion method, estimated revenues, estimated contract values and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenues earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenues and profit, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition. To the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have customer approval for a change in scope but for which we do not have an agreed upon price change. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of change order approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.\nWe consider claims to be amounts that we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes. Claims are included in the calculation of revenue when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. Revenue in excess of contract costs from claims is recognized when an agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred.\nOther contract forms - We also use unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts. For these jobs, revenue is recognized primarily based on contractual terms. For example, time and material contract revenues are generally recognized on an input basis, based on labor hours incurred and on purchases made. Similarly, unit price contracts generally recognize revenue on an output based measurement such as the completion of specific units at a specified unit price.\nAt any time, if an estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full at that time. The loss amount is recognized as an \u201caccrued loss provision\u201d and is included in the accrued expenses and other liabilities amount on the balance sheet. For fixed-price contracts, as the percentage-of-completion method is used to calculate revenues, the accrued loss provision is changed so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. The provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was $7.3 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nChanges in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income. These revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified.\nIn all forms of contracts, we estimate collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as revenue, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client's expected budget amount, the client frequently requires an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. In these situations, we may choose to defer recognition of revenue up to the time that the client pays for the services.\nThe caption \u201cCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents unbilled receivables, which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date. Balances represent: (a) unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting which may not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or project milestone, (b) incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursement type contracts, (c) amounts arising from routine lags in billing, or (d) the revenue associated with unapproved change orders or claims when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. For those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date, the excess amounts are included in the caption \u201cBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d.\nIn accordance with applicable terms of certain construction contracts, retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project. Some payments of the retainage may not be received for a significant period after completion of our portion of a project. In some jurisdictions, retainage amounts are deposited into an escrow account.\nValuation of acquired businesses-We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects, inventory and fixed assets (generally consisting of construction equipment) for each acquisition. We determine the fair value of these assets on the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, the Company will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions.\nA liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management's best estimate.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a \u201cmeasurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived intangible Assets-Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated.\nWe account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test.\nAt December 31, 2015, goodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our reporting units as follows (in millions):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> Reporting Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rockford\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Q3C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JCG (includes Heavy Civil and Infrastructure and Maintenance divisions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PES (includes PES Industrial, PPS, Saxon & Surber divisions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aevenia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OnQuest Canada, ULC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 124.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder ASU 2012-02 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, the Company can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Typically, however, the Company uses the two-step impairment test outlined in ASC Topic 350. First, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination was determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded relating to the goodwill attributed to Cardinal Contractors, Inc., which is a part of the East Segment, and in December 2013, an impairment expense of $0.8 million was recorded relating to FSSI, a part of the Energy segment, for intangible assets for customer relations. There were no other impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nDisruptions to our business, such as end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit, may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future.\nReserve for uninsured risks-Estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks. Significant judgments by us and, where possible, third-party experts are needed in determining probable and/or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change.\nWe self-insure worker's compensation claims up to $0.25 million per claim. We maintained a self-insurance reserve totaling approximately $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 and approximately $22.3 million at December 31, 2014. Claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred. Our accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel. The amount is included in \u201caccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d on our balance sheets. Actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves.\nIncome taxes-We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC Topic 740 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred income tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of our management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available\nevidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination was made.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nLong-Lived Assets-Assets held and used by the Company, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. We perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the future carrying value of our long-lived assets may have differing future fair values.\nMultiemployer plans - Various subsidiaries in the West segment are signatories to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements require that the Company participate in and contribute to a number of multiemployer benefit plans for its union employees at rates determined by the agreements. The trustees for each multiemployer plan determine the eligibility and allocations of contributions and benefit amounts, determine the types of benefits and administer the plan. To the extent that any plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, requires that if the Company were to withdraw from an agreement or if a plan is terminated, we may incur a withdrawal obligation. Since the withdrawal liability is based on estimates of our proportional share of the plan's unfunded vested liability, as calculated by the plan's actuaries, the potential withdrawal obligation may be significant.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association \u201cPLCA\u201d including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the Company's acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. The Company recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.59 million after the acquisition of Q3C, based on information provided by the Plan. The Plan asserted that the PLCA members did not affect a proper withdrawal in 2011, and in May 2014, the Plan asserted that the total liability for the Company was $11.8 million. A legal proceeding commenced, and the United States District Court ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members in 2011 was not effective. The PLCA appealed this decision, but as required by the Plan, the Company began making monthly payments which have totaled $1.83 million through December 31, 2015. These payments have been expensed.\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and ruled that the withdrawal was effective in 2011 as had been asserted by the PLCA. The Company has received a revised withdrawal liability calculation from the Plan at an amount approximately equal to the company's accrual amount. The Company and other members of the PLCA are engaged in arbitration to further reduce the amount owed. The Company is making payments while awaiting the results of the arbitration process. The Company has no plans to withdraw from any other agreements\nLitigation and contingencies-Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defense to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company.

The decrease was primarily from the impact of unusually severe wet weather in the Gulf States during the first half of 2015 and the completion of two large projects in the Energy segment which were not fully replaced in 2015. The historic rainfall in the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter, caused us to suspend operations on various projects and to incur additional costs to recover from the weather conditions. Revenues were also impacted by the delay in certain capital projects as a result of lower oil prices.\nFrom an end-market perspective, our end-market revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $120.8 million for underground capital projects and the industrial end-market revenues decreased by $252.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues increased in our heavy civil end-market by $123.1 million, in our underground utility end-market by $65.9 million, in the engineering end-market by $9.6 million and by $18.0 million in our other end-markets, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue in 2014 grew to $2.1 billion, an increase of $142.0 million, or 7.3% from the prior year. The increase in revenue at the energy segment of $269.8 million, and at the East segment of $59.5 million, was partially offset by a decline in the West segment of $187.3 million. In 2014, the West segment represented 46.2% of total revenue, the Energy segment represented 30.3%, and the East segment was 23.5% of total revenue. Revenue from acquisitions made in 2014 and 2013 added $18.9 million to revenue.\nGross Profit\n2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit decreased by $16.2 million, or 6.9% compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of the 7.5% decrease in revenues and to inefficiencies associated with stopping and starting projects as a result of the weather delays in the Gulf States during the first half of 2015.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 11.4% from 11.3% from the same period in 2014.\n2014 and 2013\nGross profit for 2014 decreased by $20.0 million, or 7.8%, from 2013. As discussed in the segment results below, the decrease in gross profit was $47.3 million in the West segment. Gross profit for the Energy segment increased by $25.9 million and increased by $1.4 million for the East segment. Gross profit from acquisitions made in 2014 and 2013 added $3.0 million to 2014 gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 13.2% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2014 as a result of the large decrease in both revenue and gross profit in the West segment\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n2015 and 2014\nSelling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, office rent and utilities and acquisition costs. For 2015, SG&A expenses were $152.1 million, compared to $132.2 million in 2014, an increase of $19.9 million. Of the increase, $3.9 million was from the 2015 acquisition of Aevenia and $1.6 million of the increase was due to the impact of the 2014 acquisitions of Vadnais, Surber and Ram-Fab. Of the remaining $14.4 million increase, professional fees increased by $9.1 million, we recorded a one-time valuation adjustment for the value of a long-term asset of $2.6 million and the remaining $2.7 million increase represented expenses associated with increased compensation and staffing levels. The majority of the increase in professional fees was an increase in legal fees associated with our collection efforts on the disputed receivables discussed later in this Item and the expenses incurred in our ongoing internal review of the methods used by our subsidiaries to recognize revenue and estimate contingencies for ongoing projects as discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cWe may not be successful in continuing to meet the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on form 10-K. In addition, the increase in professional fees included fees associated with our efforts to improve our documentation of internal controls over financial reporting.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to 7.9% compared to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of both increased expenses and the decrease in revenues in 2015.\n2014 and 2013\nSG&A expenses were $132.2 million in 2014 compared to $130.8 million in 2013. The prior year included one-time expenses of $5.7 million related to impairment costs. Excluding the one-time expenses, SG&A in 2014 increased $7.1 million, or 5.7%, which included an increase of $1.4 million as a result of the 2014 acquisitions of Vadnais, Surber and Ram-Fab. Remaining increases were due to increases in compensation and benefits, marketing and communications expenses and professional fees.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 6.3% for 2014, from 6.7% for 2013.\nOther income and expense\nNon-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from non-consolidated investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere was no income from non-consolidated investments for 2015. For 2014, income from non-consolidated investments was primarily from the sale of our interest of the WesPac Energy non-consolidated joint venture, and for 2013, the loss from non-consolidated investments included an impairment expense and operating loss totalling $5.5 million for the WesPac Energy joint venture, partially offset by a $0.7 million profit from a 49% owned investment, Alvah, Inc.\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the United States dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. Many of our contracts in Calgary, Canada are sold based on United States dollars, but a portion of the work is paid for with Canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of the net reversal of $1.9 million in contingent consideration as Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber missed financial targets contemplated in their respective purchase agreements. Net other expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to adjustments to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Q3C, Surber and Vadnais. Net other income for 2013 was $4.8 million. The major components include $6.5 million as reductions in the liability for contingent consideration since the PPS, Saxon and FSSI acquisitions did not meet the performance targets outlined in their purchase agreements. The income was partially offset by increases of $2.5 million in the fair value of the liabilities for contingent consideration recorded throughout 2013 for acquisitions, including Q3C.\nInterest income is derived from interest earned on excess cash invested primarily in short term U.S. Treasury bills, backed by the federal government, and other investments that may not be backed by the federal government.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million, compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2014 due to increased equipment debt financing and additional borrowing under the Company's agreement for senior secured notes. The increased interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to increases in equipment debt financing, and a full year of interest on a $25 million long-term note drawn-down in July 2013.\nThe weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 2.9%, 3.0% and 3.3%, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income tax decreased $14.7 million to $23.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the decrease in pretax profits. The effective tax rate on income before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 39.19% and 37.77% for the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 39.37% for the year 2015 and 37.96% for 2014. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate was the impact of partially non-deductible per diem expenses, which while decreasing by $5.2 million in 2015, were a greater percentage of pre-tax income.\nOur provision for income tax decreased $6.3 million to $38.6 million for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of decreased pretax profits between the years and a decrease in our effective tax rate.\nSegment Results\nThe following discussion describes the significant factors contributing to the results of our three operating segments. All intersegment revenues and gross profit, which were immaterial, have been eliminated in the following tables.\nWest Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the West segment for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> West Construction Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 913.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 964.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 190.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 and 2014\nWest segment revenue for 2015 decreased by $50.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2014. Revenue declined at the ARB Industrial division by $105.0 million with $80.2 million of the decrease the result of completion of a solar plant project in the Mojave Desert in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by increases at ARB Structures and Q3C totaling $62.2 million. The ARB Structures revenue increase was driven primarily by work on a large parking structure in southern California, and the Q3C revenue increase was attributable primarily to additional work performed for its largest customer, a gas and electric utility, totaling $27.6 million.\nGross profit for the West segment decreased by $13.2 million or 9.2% for 2015 versus 2014. The primary reason was a reduction of gross profit at both ARB Industrial and Rockford totaling $17.4 million, offset by an increase at ARB Underground of $5.1 million. The declines were due to the reduction in revenue at ARB Industrial and the impact of the rain in the second quarter on the pipeline operations of Rockford. The increase realized by ARB Underground was driven largely by increased MSA work performed for a major public gas and electric utility customer under its Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.3% in 2015 compared to 14.9% in 2014, still consistent with historical ratios. This decline in margin is largely attributable to Rockford's margin decrease from 11.6% in 2014 to 8.6% in 2015 reflecting a reduced level of work in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the rainy weather on a large diameter pipeline job in the Houston, TX area.\n2014 and 2013\nWest segment revenue in 2014 decreased by $187.3 million, or 16.3%, compared to 2013. Revenue declined at Rockford by $175.6 million primarily as a result of the completion of several large projects in 2013 and a $102 million decrease for a customer in the Marcellus shale region. Revenue decreased by $41.8 million at the ARB Underground division primarily due to reduced revenue of $23.2 million from traditional MSA customers, a decline of $40.1 million for one-time projects completed in 2013 partially offset by an increase in pipeline integrity work for a large gas utility customer. ARB Industrial division revenues declined by $21.8 million as a result of an $84.3 million decrease from the substantial completion of a major power plant project in 2013. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $53.2 million for construction of a solar plant project in the Mojave Desert in 2014. Finally, revenue at Q3C increased $62.2 million compared to 2013 due primarily to increase in work for a large utility located in the north central United States.\nGross profit for the West segment decreased by $47.3 million or 24.8%. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction of gross profit at ARB of $54.3 million. The declines were due to a combination of the close out of a major power plant project, the substantial completion of the Blythe joint venture project, the mix of MSA jobs at ARB Underground and the decline in revenue including $4.4 million less equipment cost absorption by the jobs as a result of the lower activity levels in 2014 compared to 2013. Gross profit at Rockford decreased by $5.1 million while gross profit at Q3C increased by $13.5 million, with the revenue at the operating units serving as the primary driver of gross profit changes.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.9% in 2014 compared to 16.6% in 2013. The percentage in 2013 was higher than our historical percentages, which have ranged from 13% to 16% of revenue as a result of the substantial completion in 2013 of a power plant project by the ARB Industrial division. In addition, ARB Industrial recorded revenue of $29.5 million in 2013 and revenue of $82.6 million in 2014 for construction services at a large solar project in the Mojave Desert. Because of uncertainty as to collectability at the end of the cost-reimbursable project, we recorded revenues equal to cost for this project. Excluding the revenue and cost of this project, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have been 16.3% for 2014 compared to 17.0% for 2013.\nEast Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the East segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> East Construction Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 612.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 430.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 and 2014\nEast segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $122.2 million, or 25.0% from 2014. The increase was due primarily to JCG's infrastructure and maintenance division work at a large petrochemical facility project in Louisiana.\nEast segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $16.8 million, or 65.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was due primarily to the increased revenue for the JCG infrastructure and maintenance division petrochemical project in Louisiana. Gross profit decreased at both JCG's heavy civil division and Cardinal Contractors. Gross profit for JCG heavy civil division projects decreased by $15.3 million primarily from delays at the Texas DOT projects in the Belton, TX area, and Cardinal Contractors gross profits decreased by $4.9 million, primarily from reduced margins for two Texas wastewater projects.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 6.9 % in 2015 compared to 5.3% in 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue for the East segment increased by $59.5 million, or 13.8% from 2013. Of the increase, $66.1 million was at JCG's heavy civil and infrastructure and maintenance divisions due primarily to increases of $42.8 million in Texas DOT revenue and an increase of $40.2 million in Mississippi DOT revenue. The increases were partially offset by a reduction of $19.1 million in Louisiana DOT revenue. Additionally, Cardinal Contractor's revenue decreased by $8.9 million, reflecting decreased work in the wastewater facility market in Florida.\nGross profit for the East segment increased by $1.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2013. The increased percentage was lower than the revenue growth primarily as a result of reduced gross profit of $1.9 million for JCG heavy civil projects offset by increases of $1.8 million at JCG's infrastructure and maintenance divisions and $0.6 million for Cardinal Contractor's projects. Heavy civil experienced a $7.9 million decrease in gross profit due to both the impact of the lower Louisiana DOT revenues and reduced gross profit on Texas DOT work. This decrease was partially offset by gross profit increases of $5.6 million in other heavy civil work, primarily on Mississippi DOT projects.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.3 % in 2014 compared to 5.6% in 2013 primarily as a result of the lower gross profit Texas and Louisiana heavy civil projects.\nEnergy Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Energy segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 403.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 632.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 362.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 and 2014\nRevenue for the Energy segment decreased by $228.6 million, or 36.2% from 2014. The PES Industrial division revenue decreased by $116.0 million, primarily due to completion of a fertilizer plant project in 2014, and the impact of the unusually severe rainy weather during the first half of the year, which delayed our ability to start work for a chemical plant project in Louisiana. PES's pipeline division revenue decreased by $113.9 million as a result of completion of a pipeline project in 2014. For the PES Saxon division, revenue decreased by $36.6 million as a result of a 2014 completion of a project in the Houston Ship Channel, partially offset by increases from two projects in Pennsylvania. OnQuest and OnQuest Canada revenue in 2015 increased by $9.6 million as a result of an LNG project in Florida. Revenue for Aevenia, acquired on February 28, 2015, was $23.7 million.\nGross profit for the Energy segment decreased by $19.8 million, or 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. The PES industrial division, PES pipeline division and the PES Saxon division gross profit decreased $27.1 million as a result of the reduction in revenue. PES's Specialty division gross profit increased $3.6 million as a result of the completion of a chilled water project in Texas. Aevenia's gross profit was $2.4 million.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7% in 2015 compared to 10.6% in 2014. The increase was primarily the result of two offsetting factors. The first was due to the effect of zero margin work on a large pipeline project at the PES Pipeline division in 2014 and it's resulting lower prior year gross profit margin percentage. Offsetting this was reduced 2015 gross profits caused by the heavy rains during the first half of 2015 and decreased labor efficiency rates.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue for the Energy segment increased by $269.8 million, or 74.5% from 2013. The PES Industrial division revenue increased by $129.0 million primarily from work activity at petrochemical facilities in south Louisiana. PES's PPS division revenue increased by $85.5 million as a result of increased revenues from capital projects. PES's Saxon division revenue increased by $17.1\nmillion and OnQuest and OnQuest Canada revenue in 2014 increased by $21.5 million as a result of additional revenue from construction of a micro LNG facility in 2014.\nGross profit for the Energy segment increased by $25.9 million, or 63.1%, compared to 2013. The PES Industrial division gross profit increased $14.6 million primarily due to the division's increased revenues. PES's PPS division gross profit increased $4.1 million due to increased revenues and the Saxon division gross profit increased $3.7 million as a result of increased revenues and improved profit margins compared to 2013. OnQuest and OnQuest Canada profit margins in 2014 increased by $1.5 million due to increased revenues.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.6% in 2014 compared to 11.3% in 2013 primarily as a result of the reduced margins at PES's PPS division. Similar to ARB Industrial, PPS recorded revenues equal to cost for a large pipeline project for which we have concerns about collectability of the full contractual amount. In 2013, PPS recorded revenue of $9.2 million and in 2014, PPS recorded revenue of $121.2 million for the project. Excluding the revenue of this project, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have been 13.0% for 2014 compared to 11.6% for 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Needs\nLiquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund business operations and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our net cash flow. If needed, we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis. We may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock, convertible notes, term debt or increasing our credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $161.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $170.5 million at December 31, 2014. We anticipate that our cash and investments on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our operating needs, our planned capital expenditures and our ability to grow for at least the next twelve months.\nThe construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. Historically, we have invested an amount that approximated the sum of depreciation and amortization expenses plus proceeds from equipment sales. In 2015, capital expenditures were approximately $67.1 million. For 2015, the amount of depreciation, amortization and equipment sales was approximately $75.1 million. Capital expenses are expected to total $55 to $60 million for 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash flows during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (102.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (97.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (56.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe source of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions received from non-consolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other than temporary impairment expense for non-consolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill/Intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net deferred taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (88.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (45.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (38.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (44.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2015 of $48.4 million increased by $12.3 million compared to 2014. This increase was caused by the $6.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization, the reduced provision for income taxes of $14.7 million, offset by the decrease in operating income of $36.0 million and due to the $46.3 million net changes in assets and liabilities in 2015 compared to the net change of $88.7 million in 2014.\nThe components of the $46.3 million change in assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:\n\u00b7 an increase of $2.1 million in customer retention deposits;\n\u00b7 a decrease of $19.5 million in accounts receivable, primarily as a result of a decrease of $17.7 million in amounts retained by customers as we have completed major projects. At December 31, 2015, accounts receivable represented 28.3% of our total assets compared to 30.4% at the end of 2014. In general, we continue to maintain an excellent collection history, and we have certain lien rights that can provide additional security for collections. However, as outlined in the section \u201cReceivable Collection Actions\u201d, we are in dispute resolution with two customers with a total receivable amount $50.8 million, or 16.0% of our total accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015;\n\u00b7 an increase of $47.5 million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Increases associated with the time lag from when revenues were earned until the customer can be billed were approximately $23.6 million for ARB, primarily for two large utility customers, and $22.6 million for JCG, primarily for public agency heavy civil projects which require inspector approval prior to billing;\n\u00b7 a decrease in inventory and other current assets of $4.9 million primarily as a result of the 2015 utilization of the prior year tax receivable;\n\u00b7 accounts payable decreased by $5.1 million, primarily impacted by the timing of vendor payments;\n\u00b7 a net decrease of $19.6 million in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings reflecting the timing of work progression and billings;\n\u00b7 a decrease of $6.7 million in contingent earn-out liabilities, from a payment of $5.0 million made in March 2015 and the reduction of the earn-out liability as a result of the Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber operations not meeting targets outlined in their purchase agreements; and\n\u00b7 a net increase of $11.7 million in accrued expenses, mainly due to an increase in workers compensation reserves.\nDuring the twelve months of 2015, we paid $18.7 million for income taxes compared to $57.6 million in the same period of the previous year. The reduction in net cash tax payments in 2015 was the result of a decrease in the Company's current tax provision and the utilization of significant prepayments from 2014.\nInvesting activities\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures - cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures - financed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe purchased property and equipment for $67.1 million, $88.0 million and $89.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally for our construction activities. We believe the ownership of equipment is generally preferable to renting equipment on a project-by-project basis, as ownership helps to ensure the equipment is available for our workloads when needed. In addition, ownership has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs.\nWe periodically sell equipment, typically to update our fleet. We received proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $9.9 million, $5.8 million and $7.9 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we did not purchase any short-term investments, while we invested $33.8 million and $23.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in short-term investments. We sold short-term investments amounting to $31.0 million, $21.5 million and $7.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Short-term investments consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury bills with various financial institutions.\nWe used $22.3 million in cash for the Aevenia acquisition, $14.6 million in cash for the Vadnais and Surber/Ram-Fab/Williams acquisitions in 2014 and $2.3 million in cash for the FSSI acquisition in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $21.8 million in 2015. Significant transactions impacting cash flows from financing activities included:\n\u00b7 $50.3 million in new and refinanced notes secured by our equipment and by a mortgage note on two buildings;\n\u00b7 $25.0 million in new debt under the Company's Note Agreement;\n\u00b7 $43.9 million in repayment of long-term debt and the repayment of $1.3 million in capital leases;\n\u00b7 $0.03 million in payments of accumulated earnings to the Blythe non-controlling interest holder;\n\u00b7 Dividend payments of $9.8 million to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015; and\n\u00b7 $1.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of 96,828 shares of common stock purchased by the participants in the Primoris Long-term Retention Plan.\nDebt Activities\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a revolving credit facility, as amended on December 12, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with The PrivateBank and Trust Company, as administrative agent (the \u201cAdministrative Agent\u201d) and co-lead arranger, The Bank of the West, as co-lead arranger, and IBERIABANK Corporation, Branch Banking and Trust Company and UMB Bank, N.A. (the \u201cLenders\u201d). The Credit Agreement is a $125 million revolving credit facility whereby the Lenders agree to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to the $125 million committed amount. The termination date of the Credit Agreement is December 28, 2017.\nThe principal amount of any loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin as specified in the Credit Agreement (based on the Company's senior debt to EBITDA ratio as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement), or (ii) the Base Rate (which is the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or (b) the prime rate as announced by the Administrative Agent). Quarterly non-use fees, letter of credit fees and administrative agent fees are payable at rates specified in the Credit Agreement.\nThe principal amount of any loan drawn under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part, with a minimum prepayment of $5 million, at any time, potentially subject to make-whole provisions.\nThe Credit Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants for facilities of this type, as discussed below.\nCommercial letters of credit outstanding were $12.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $4.7 million at December 31, 2014. Other than commercial letters of credit, there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2015 was $112.9 million.\nSenior Secured Notes and Shelf Agreement\nOn December 28, 2012, the Company entered into a $50 million Senior Secured Notes purchase (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and a $25 million private shelf agreement (the \u201cNotes Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, The Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and certain Prudential affiliates (the \u201cNoteholders\u201d). On June 3, 2015, the Notes Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance of additional notes of up to $75 million over the next three year period ending June 3, 2018 (\u201cAdditional Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe Senior Notes amount was funded on December 28, 2012. The Senior Notes are due December 28, 2022 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.65%, paid quarterly in arrears. Annual principal payments of $7.1 million are required from December 28, 2016 through December 28, 2021 with a final payment due on December 28, 2022. The principal amount may be prepaid, with a minimum prepayment of $5 million, at any time, subject to make-whole provisions.\nOn July 25, 2013, the Company drew $25 million available under the Notes Agreement. The notes are due July 25, 2023 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.85% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from July 25, 2017 with a final payment due on July 25, 2023.\nOn November 9, 2015, the Company drew $25 million available under the Additional Senior Notes Agreement. The notes are due November 9, 2025 and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.6% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from November 9, 2019 with a final payment due on November 9, 2025.\nLoans made under both the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement are secured by our assets, including, among others, our cash, inventory, goods, equipment (excluding equipment subject to permitted liens) and accounts receivable. All of our domestic subsidiaries have issued joint and several guaranties in favor of the Lenders and Noteholders for all amounts under the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement.\nBoth the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement contain various restrictive and financial covenants including among others, minimum tangible net worth, senior debt/EBITDA ratio, debt service coverage requirements and a minimum balance for unencumbered net book value for fixed assets. In addition, the agreements include restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event the Company disposes more than 20% of its total assets.\nThe Company was in compliance with the covenants for the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement at December 31, 2015.\nCanadian Credit Facility\nThe Company has a demand credit facility for $8.0 million in Canadian dollars with a Canadian bank for purposes of issuing commercial letters of credit in Canada. The credit facility has an annual renewal and provides for the issuance of commercial letters of credit for a term of up to five years. The facility provides for an annual fee of 1% for any issued and outstanding commercial letters of credit. Letters of credit can be denominated in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, letters of credit outstanding totaled $2.2 million and $2.6 million in Canadian dollars, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the available borrowing capacity was $5.8 million in Canadian dollars. The credit facility contains a working capital restrictive covenant for our Canadian subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. At December 31, 2015, OnQuest Canada, ULC was in compliance with the covenant.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $275.3 million of outstanding long-term debt and capital lease obligations. There were no short-term borrowings.\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real property leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real property leases-related parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 338.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The interest amount represents interest payments for our fixed rate debt assuming that principal payments are made as originally scheduled.\nThe table does not include obligations under multi-employer pension plans in which some of our employees participate. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates are generally specified in our collective bargaining agreements, and contributions are made to the plans based on employee payrolls. Our obligations for future periods cannot be determined because we cannot predict the number of employees that we will employ at any given time nor the plans in which they may participate.\nWe may also be required to make additional contributions to multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these contributions will be determined based on our union payroll. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules for multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers. The amounts of additional funds that we may be obligated to contribute cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the table above.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (\u201cPLCA\u201d), including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the Company's acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. The Company recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C, based on information provided by the Plan. The Plan asserted that the PLCA members did not affect a proper withdrawal in 2011, and in May 2014, the Plan asserted that the total liability for the Company was $11.8 million. A legal proceeding commenced, and a United States District Court ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members in 2011 was not effective. The PLCA appealed this decision, but as required by the Plan, the Company began making monthly payments which have totaled $1.8 million through December 31, 2015. These payments have been expensed.\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and ruled that the withdrawal was effective in 2011 as had been asserted by the PLCA. The Company has received a revised withdrawal liability calculation from the Plan at an amount approximately equal to the company's accrual amount. The Company and other members of the PLCA are engaged in arbitration to further reduce the amount owed. The Company is making payments while awaiting the results of the arbitration process. The Company has no plans to withdraw from any other agreements.\nWe have also excluded from the table any interest and fees associated with letters of credit and commitment fees under our credit facility since these amounts are unknown and variable.\nRelated Party Transactions\nPrimoris has entered into leasing transactions with Stockdale Investment Group, Inc. (\u201cSIGI\u201d). Brian Pratt, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and our largest stockholder, holds a majority interest and is the chairman, president and chief executive officer and a director of SIGI. John M. Perisich, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, is secretary of SIGI.\nPrimoris leases properties from SIGI at the following locations:\n1. Bakersfield, California (lease expires October 2022)\n2. Pittsburg, California (lease expires April 2023)\n3. San Dimas, California (lease expires March 2019)\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $0.83 million, $0.86 million and $0.91 million, respectively, in lease payments to SIGI for the use of these properties.\nPrimoris leases a property from Roger Newnham, a former owner and current manager of our subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. The property is located in Calgary, Canada. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 Primoris paid $0.25 million, $0.29 million and $0.30 million, respectively, in lease payments. The current term of the lease will expire on December 31, 2017.\nPrimoris leases a property from Lemmie Rockford, one of the Rockford sellers, which commenced November 1, 2011. The property is located in Toledo, Washington. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Primoris paid $0.09 million each year, in lease payments. The lease will expire in January 2017.\nPrimoris leases a property from Quality RE Partners, owned by three of the Q3C selling shareholders, of whom two are current employees, including Jay Osborn, an operations president in the West Construction segment. The property is located in Little\nCanada, Minnesota. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $0.27 million, $0.26 million and $0.26 million, respectively, in lease payments to Quality RE Partners. The lease expires in October 2022. In addition, in November 2015, Q3C purchased construction equipment at fair value from Quality RE Partners for $0.6 million. Q3C also leased construction equipment from Mr. Osborn during 2015 for $0.04 million and subsequently purchased the equipment at fair value for $0.145 million.\nWe believe that the amounts that we pay for the leases approximate terms that we could obtain from independent third parties. In addition, related party transactions, any new leases, extensions of lease terms and changes in lease terms or amounts must be approved in advance by the independent directors of the Board of Directors Audit Committee.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs is common in our industry, we enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected on our balance sheet. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangement with variable interest entities. The following represent transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered material off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\u00b7 Letters of credit issued under our lines of credit. At December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit outstanding of $13.7 million, primarily for international projects in our Energy segment, a large domestic pipeline project and for providing security to our insurance carriers. These letters of credit are used by some of our carriers to ensure reimbursement for amounts that they are disbursing on our behalf, such as beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance program. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post a letter of credit to ensure payments to our subcontractors or guarantee performance under our contracts. Letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement and Canadian Credit Facility. If these letters of credit were drawn on by the beneficiary, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, and we may be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit.\n\u00b7 We enter into non-cancellable operating leases for some of our facilities, equipment and vehicles, including leases with related parties. At December 31, 2015, equipment operating leases had a remaining commitment of $14.2 million and facility rental commitments were $18.8 million.\n\u00b7 Employment agreements which provide for compensation and benefits under certain circumstances and which may contain a change of control clause. We may be obligated to make payments under the terms of these agreements.\n\u00b7 In the ordinary course of our business, we may be required by our customers to post surety bid or completion bonds in connection with services that we provide. At December 31, 2015, we had $1.48 billion in outstanding bonds. We do not believe that it is likely that we would have to fund material claims under our surety arrangements.\n\u00b7 Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions. In most instances, these agreements require that we contribute to multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. For many plans, the contributions are determined annually and required future contributions cannot be determined since contribution rates depend on the total number of union employees and actuarial calculations based on the demographics of all participants. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Amendments Act of 1980, subject employers to potential liabilities in the event of an employer's complete or partial withdrawal of an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules that are classified as \u201cendangered\u201d, \u201cseriously endangered\u201d, or \u201ccritical\u201d status. As discussed in Note 18 - \u201cMultiemployer Plans\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have recognized a withdrawal liability for one plan. We currently do not anticipate withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plans. Withdrawal liabilities or requirements for increased future contributions could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity; and\n\u00b7 Other guarantees that we make from time to time, such as guaranteeing the obligations of our subsidiaries.\nReceivable Collection Actions\nAs all construction contractors, we negotiate payments with our customers from time to time, and we may encounter delays in receiving payments from our customers. However, in 2014, we encountered unusual situations with two contracts. In one instance, ARB Industrial performed work on a solar plant in the Mojave Desert. Based on our concerns about eventual collectability for the cost-reimbursable contract and in spite of many assurances of payment from the owner, we chose to recognize revenue equal to cost. At the end of the project, the owner chose not to pay the final amounts due totaling $32.9 million. We are currently engaged in\nalternative dispute resolution as required by the contract. The owner has bonded around the liens that we filed, and we believe that action will enhance collectability of amounts due at the end of the dispute process.\nIn addition, a division of PES constructed a large capital pipeline for a customer in Texas. During the early stages of the project, we became concerned that the customer would not pay us for ancillary items as we believe is required by the contract. As a result of our concerns about eventual collectability, we chose to recognize revenue equal to cost. We have initiated legal action and filed liens to collect our $17.9 million receivable.\nThe Company has specific reserves of approximately $26 million for these two projects included in \u201cbillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d. While we believe that in both instances we are owed the full amount of the receivable, there can be no guarantee of the final amount that we receive or the timing of a resolution of the two matters.\n2016 Outlook\nWe believe that we have market growth opportunities in 2016 and well into 2017 even if the price of oil remains at a depressed level for 2016. We do note that the increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental requirements for many of our client's infrastructure improvements and impact of the reduced oil price create uncertainty as to the timing of some of our opportunities. We believe that Primoris has the financial and operational strength to meet these short-term challenges, and we continue to be optimistic about longer-term opportunities. Specifically, our view of the outlook for our major end markets currently is as follows:\n\u00b7 Construction of petroleum, natural gas, and natural gas liquid pipelines - We expect that at the current oil price, activities in most if not all of the shale basins will be reduced or eliminated significantly reducing any upstream work such as gathering lines and petroleum transport pipelines for the near future. If production from the shale formations continues to increase in the near future, the current disconnect between production and processing locations provides opportunities for our underground construction operations serving midstream companies, primarily Rockford, ARB Underground and Primoris Pipeline & Maintenance groups. We expect that the efforts by gas utilities to move shale gas from the Marcellus region to Florida and other Atlantic states will continue and will provide significant opportunity for Rockford over the next 2-3 years.\n\u00b7 Inspection, maintenance and replacement of gas utility infrastructure -We expect that continuing safety enhancements to the gas utility infrastructure will provide continuing opportunities for our ARB Underground operations, especially in California, as well as Q3C in the Midwest. We also expect that ongoing gas utility repair and maintenance opportunities will continue to grow benefiting our Q3C and PES groups.\n\u00b7 Construction of natural gas-fired power plants and heavy industrial plants - We expect continued construction opportunities for both base-load and peak shaving power plants; however, we are aware that concerns expressed in California that power plants are not \u201cacceptable\u201d for environmental reasons may impact the timing of near term construction opportunities. We believe that based on continuing population growth, the intermittency of renewable power resources and the environmental requirements associated with using ocean water for cooling, power plants will be needed in spite of vocal opposition to \u201cnon-green\u201d sources. In addition, the current low price of natural gas could result in the conversion of coal-fired power plants and conversion and expansion at chemical plants and industrial facilities in other parts of the United States. These opportunities would benefit our ARB Industrial group and PES Industrial group.\n\u00b7 Construction of alternative energy facilities, wind farms, solar energy - We anticipate continued construction opportunities as state governments remain committed to renewable power standards, primarily benefitting ARB Industrial and to a lesser degree our PES group.\n\u00b7 Transportation infrastructure construction opportunities - We believe that passing of longer term highway funding by the federal government in 2015 and voter approval of a highway funding proposition 7 in Texas will provide increased opportunity for our heavy civil and highway groups especially in Texas. We expect that opportunities in the Louisiana market may improve but will remain at depressed levels except for specific programs. This market primarily impacts the operations of JCG.\n\u00b7 Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities-We believe the LNG on-purpose opportunities for rail, barge, and other transportation needs will continue to grow, albeit at a slow pace. This market will primarily impact our OnQuest and PES groups. We further believe the existing large scale LNG export facilities currently being planned will require services that will benefit our PES and JCG groups for field services.\nPlease note that our 2016 outlook and 2016 financial results could be adversely impacted by many factors including those discussed in Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This \u201c2016 Outlook\u201d consists of forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the cautions about forward looking statements found at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBacklog\nFor companies in the construction industry, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We define backlog is defined as a combination of: (1) anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts for which we have known revenue amounts for fixed price and fixed unit price contracts (\u201cFixed Backlog\u201d), and (2) the estimated revenues on MSA's for the next four quarters (\u201cMSA Backlog\u201d). We normally do not include time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts in the calculation of backlog, when their ultimate revenue amount is difficult to estimate in advance.\nThe two components of backlog, Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog, are detailed below.\nFixed Backlog\nFixed Backlog by operating segment and the changes in Fixed Backlog for the periods ending

The backlog estimates include amounts from estimated MSA revenues, but our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs. Any of our contracts, MSA, fixed price or fixed unit price, may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements or project specific issues. Future revenues from projects completed under time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable-plus-fee contracts may not be included in our estimated backlog amount.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included as item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in \u201cItem 1A Risk Factors\u201d.\nThe following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet transactions and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog.\nIntroduction\nPrimoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries, which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.\nWe have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical\ncompanies in the western United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length - from several weeks, to as long as 48 months for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues.\nWe recognize revenues and profitability on our contracts depending on the type of contract. For our fixed price, or lump sum, contracts, we record revenue as the work progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis which means that we recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in proportion to the total estimated costs expected to complete the contract. Fixed price contracts may include retainage provisions under which customers withhold a percentage of the contract price until the project is complete. For our unit price, time and material, and cost-plus contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed or services are performed. The \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section below provides additional information on our contracts and revenue recognition practices.\nThe Company segregates its business into three operating segments, which include: The West Construction Services segment (\u201cWest segment\u201d), the East Construction Services segment (\u201cEast segment\u201d) and the Energy segment. The following is a brief description of each of our reportable segments and business activities.\nThe West segment includes the underground and industrial operations and construction services performed by ARB, Inc. (\u201cARB\u201d), ARB Structures, Inc., Rockford Corporation (\u201cRockford\u201d), Q3 Contracting, Inc. (\u201cQ3C\u201d), and Vadnais Trenchless Services, Inc. (\u201cVadnais\u201d). ARB and ARB Structures perform work primarily in California; while, Rockford operates throughout the United States and Q3C operates in Colorado and the upper Midwest United States. The segment also included three joint venture operations. The West segment consists of business headquartered primarily in the western United States.\nThe East segment includes the James Construction Group (\u201cJCG\u201d) Heavy Civil division, the JCG Infrastructure and Maintenance division, BW Primoris, LLC and Cardinal Contractors, Inc. construction business, located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and includes the heavy civil construction and infrastructure and maintenance operations.\nThe Energy segment businesses are located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The segment includes the operations of the Primoris Energy Services (\u201cPES\u201d) pipeline and gas facility construction and maintenance operations, the PES Industrial division, the Surber and Ram-Fab operations and the newly acquired Primoris Aevenia, Inc. (\u201cAevenia\u201d) operations. Additionally, the segment includes the OnQuest, Inc. (\u201cOnQuest\u201d) and OnQuest Canada, ULC operations for the design and installation of high-performance furnaces and heaters for the oil refining, petrochemical and power generation industries.\nThe following table lists the Company's primary operating subsidiaries and their operating segment:\n\nPES acquired the net assets of two companies, The Saxon Group (\u201cSaxon\u201d) in 2012 and Force Specialty Services, Inc. (\u201cFSSI\u201d) in 2013. Effective January 1, 2014, Saxon and FSSI were merged into PES along with the Industrial division of JCG. Throughout this Form 10-K, references to FSSI, Saxon and James Industrial are to the divisions of PES for 2015 and 2014, while the references for 2013 are to the entities or divisions.\nARB owned 50% of the Blythe Power Constructors joint venture (\u201cBlythe\u201d) created for the installation of a parabolic trough solar field and steam generation system in California, and results of Blythe's operations have been included as part of the West segment. The Company determined that in accordance with FASB Topic 810, it was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and has consolidated the results of Blythe in its financial statements. The project has been completed, the project warranty expired in May 2015 and dissolution was completed in the third quarter 2015.\nARB owns a 50% interest in two separate joint ventures, both formed in 2015: (1) The Carlsbad Power Constructors joint venture (\u201cCarlsbad\u201d) will engineer and construct a gas-fired power generation facility and (2) a joint venture titled \u201cARB Inc. & B&M Engineering Co.\u201d (\u201cWilmington\u201d) will also engineer and construct a co-generation facility. Both projects are located in the Southern California area. The joint venture operations are included as part of the West segment. As a result of determining that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the two VIE's, the results of the Carlsbad and Wilmington joint ventures are consolidated in the Company's financial statements. The Carlsbad project is expected to be completed in 2017 and the Wilmington project in 2018.\nFinancial information for the joint ventures is presented in \u201cNote 13- Noncontrolling Interests\u201d.\nIn January 2014, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, BW Primoris, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (\u201cBWP\u201d). BWP's goal is to develop water projects, primarily in Texas, that will need the Company's construction services. On January 22, 2014, BWP entered into an agreement to purchase the assets and business of Blaus Wasser, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, for approximately $5 million. BWP has entered into an intercompany construction contract with Cardinal Contractors, Inc. to build a small water treatment facility which will be owned by BWP. Beginning in 2016, the facility will generate revenues through a take-or-pay contract with a West Texas municipal entity. All intercompany revenue, cost and profit of the construction project was eliminated. At December 31, 2015, a total of $13.8 million has been capitalized, including the acquisition costs, as property, plant and equipment.\nIn May 2014, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Vadnais, a California company, which on June 5, 2014, purchased the assets of Vadnais Corporation for $6.4 million. Vadnais Corporation was a general contractor specializing in micro-tunneling in California. The assets purchased were primarily equipment, buildings and land. The purchase included a contingent earnout based on meeting certain operating targets. See \u201cNote 4-Business Combinations\u201d for further information.\nDuring the third quarter 2014, the Company made three small purchases totaling $8.2 million acquiring the net assets of Surber Roustabout, LLC (\u201cSurber\u201d), Ram-Fab, LLC (\u201cRam-Fab\u201d) and Williams Testing, LLC (\u201cWilliams\u201d). Surber and Ram-Fab operate as divisions of PES, and Williams is a division of Cardinal Contractors, Inc. Surber provides general oil and gas related construction activities in Texas; Ram-Fab is a fabricator of custom piping systems located in Arkansas; and Williams provides construction services related to sewer pipeline maintenance, rehabilitation and integrity testing in the Florida market. The Surber and Ram-Fab purchases provided for contingent earnout amounts as discussed in \u201cNote 4- Business Combinations\u201d.\nOn February 28, 2015, the Company acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. for $22.3 million in cash, and established a new entity, Aevenia, which operates as part of the Company's Energy segment. Headquartered in Moorhead, Minnesota, Aevenia is an energy and electrical construction company which specializes in overhead and underground line work, substations, telecom/fiber, and certain other client-specific on-demand call out services. The majority of their work is delivered under unit-price Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSAs\u201d). Aevenia has operations in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa. The Company believes there are opportunities for Aevenia to grow sales by performing in-house work for other Primoris subsidiaries and to expand the Company's offerings to new geographies in the Midwest United States.\nFor some end markets we perform the same services in each of our West, East and Energy segments, while for other end markets, such as poured-in-place parking structures, only one of our segments currently serves the market. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenues over three years derived from our major end-markets, with prior periods conformed to the current year market breakdown:\n\nMaterial trends and uncertainties\nWe generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects. The award of these contracts is dependent on many factors, most of which are not within our control. We depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries, the gas utility industry, as well as municipal water and wastewater customers. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, local highway and bridge needs and from the activity level in the oil and gas industry; however, each of these industries and the government agencies periodically are adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period.\nWe closely monitor our customers to assess the effect that changes in economic, market and regulatory conditions may have on them. We have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years, which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near-term. Major fluctuations in market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. The recent significant reduction in the price of oil has created uncertainty with respect to demand for our oil and gas pipeline and roustabout services in the near term, with additional uncertainty resulting over the length of time that prices will remain depressed. We believe that our upstream operations, such as the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations will remain at lower levels for an extended period. We believe that over time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services, but the impact of the low oil prices may delay midstream pipeline opportunities. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment also affects the demand for our services, either by increasing our work or delaying projects. For example, the regulatory environment in California may well result in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants while the regulators continue to search for significant renewable resources, but the renewable resources may create a demand for our construction services. Finally, we believe that regulated utility customers will continue to invest in our maintenance and replacement services.\nSeasonality, cyclicality and variability\nOur results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of the Company's work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts affect revenues and profitability since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients' internal budget cycles. As a result, the Company usually experiences higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.\nThe Company is also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and the Company's financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of its financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nTwo examples of the variability resulting from the combination of seasonality and awards of large projects are as follows. First, in the fourth quarter of 2014, revenues were less than those of the second and third quarters of 2014, primarily reflecting the completion of a large power plant project in 2013. Second, the impact from abnormally wet, rainy weather conditions in the second quarter of 2015 resulted in an unusual decrease in revenues compared to the previous year's second quarter.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value\nassumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue recognition\nFixed-price contracts - Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been generated under fixed-price contracts. For fixed-price contracts, we recognize revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, which may result in uneven and irregular results. In the percentage-of-completion method, estimated revenues, estimated contract values and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenues earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenues and profit, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition. To the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have customer approval for a change in scope but for which we do not have an agreed upon price change. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of change order approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers.\nWe consider claims to be amounts that we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers or others for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes. Claims are included in the calculation of revenue when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. Revenue in excess of contract costs from claims is recognized when an agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims, which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred.\nOther contract forms - We also use unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts. For these jobs, revenue is recognized primarily based on contractual terms. For example, time and material contract revenues are generally recognized on an input basis, based on labor hours incurred and on purchases made. Similarly, unit price contracts generally recognize revenue on an output based measurement such as the completion of specific units at a specified unit price.\nAt any time, if an estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full at that time. The loss amount is recognized as an \u201caccrued loss provision\u201d and is included in the accrued expenses and other liabilities amount on the balance sheet. For fixed-price contracts, as the percentage-of-completion method is used to calculate revenues, the accrued loss provision is changed so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. The provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was $7.3 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nChanges in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income. These revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified.\nIn all forms of contracts, we estimate collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as revenue, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client's expected budget amount, the client frequently requires an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. In these situations, we may choose to defer recognition of revenue up to the time that the client pays for the services.\nThe caption \u201cCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents unbilled receivables, which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount will not be billed until a later date. Balances represent: (a) unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting which may not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or project milestone, (b) incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursement type contracts, (c) amounts arising from routine lags in billing, or (d) the revenue associated with unapproved change orders or claims when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. For those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date, the excess amounts are included in the caption \u201cBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d.\nIn accordance with applicable terms of certain construction contracts, retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project. Some payments of the retainage may not be received for a significant period after completion of our portion of a project. In some jurisdictions, retainage amounts are deposited into an escrow account.\nValuation of acquired businesses-We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects, inventory and fixed assets (generally consisting of construction equipment) for each acquisition. We determine the fair value of these assets on the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, the Company will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions.\nA liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management's best estimate.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a \u201cmeasurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived intangible Assets-Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated.\nWe account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test.\nAt December 31, 2015, goodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our reporting units as follows (in millions):\n\nUnder ASU 2012-02 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, the Company can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Typically, however, the Company uses the two-step impairment test outlined in ASC Topic 350. First, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination was determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $0.4 million was recorded relating to the goodwill attributed to Cardinal Contractors, Inc., which is a part of the East Segment, and in December 2013, an impairment expense of $0.8 million was recorded relating to FSSI, a part of the Energy segment, for intangible assets for customer relations. There were no other impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nDisruptions to our business, such as end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit, may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future.\nReserve for uninsured risks-Estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks. Significant judgments by us and, where possible, third-party experts are needed in determining probable and/or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change.\nWe self-insure worker's compensation claims up to $0.25 million per claim. We maintained a self-insurance reserve totaling approximately $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 and approximately $22.3 million at December 31, 2014. Claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred. Our accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel. The amount is included in \u201caccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d on our balance sheets. Actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves.\nIncome taxes-We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC Topic 740 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred income tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of our management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available\nevidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination was made.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nLong-Lived Assets-Assets held and used by the Company, primarily property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. We perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, the future carrying value of our long-lived assets may have differing future fair values.\nMultiemployer plans - Various subsidiaries in the West segment are signatories to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements require that the Company participate in and contribute to a number of multiemployer benefit plans for its union employees at rates determined by the agreements. The trustees for each multiemployer plan determine the eligibility and allocations of contributions and benefit amounts, determine the types of benefits and administer the plan. To the extent that any plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, requires that if the Company were to withdraw from an agreement or if a plan is terminated, we may incur a withdrawal obligation. Since the withdrawal liability is based on estimates of our proportional share of the plan's unfunded vested liability, as calculated by the plan's actuaries, the potential withdrawal obligation may be significant.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association \u201cPLCA\u201d including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the Company's acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. The Company recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.59 million after the acquisition of Q3C, based on information provided by the Plan. The Plan asserted that the PLCA members did not affect a proper withdrawal in 2011, and in May 2014, the Plan asserted that the total liability for the Company was $11.8 million. A legal proceeding commenced, and the United States District Court ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members in 2011 was not effective. The PLCA appealed this decision, but as required by the Plan, the Company began making monthly payments which have totaled $1.83 million through December 31, 2015. These payments have been expensed.\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and ruled that the withdrawal was effective in 2011 as had been asserted by the PLCA. The Company has received a revised withdrawal liability calculation from the Plan at an amount approximately equal to the company's accrual amount. The Company and other members of the PLCA are engaged in arbitration to further reduce the amount owed. The Company is making payments while awaiting the results of the arbitration process. The Company has no plans to withdraw from any other agreements\nLitigation and contingencies-Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defense to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company. See Note 15 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue, gross profit, operating income and net income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\n\nConsolidated Results\nRevenues\n2015 and 2014\nRevenues for year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $156.8 million, or 7.5% compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily from the impact of unusually severe wet weather in the Gulf States during the first half of 2015 and the completion of two large projects in the Energy segment which were not fully replaced in 2015. The historic rainfall in the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter, caused us to suspend operations on various projects and to incur additional costs to recover from the weather conditions. Revenues were also impacted by the delay in certain capital projects as a result of lower oil prices.\nFrom an end-market perspective, our end-market revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $120.8 million for underground capital projects and the industrial end-market revenues decreased by $252.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues increased in our heavy civil end-market by $123.1 million, in our underground utility end-market by $65.9 million, in the engineering end-market by $9.6 million and by $18.0 million in our other end-markets, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue in 2014 grew to $2.1 billion, an increase of $142.0 million, or 7.3% from the prior year. The increase in revenue at the energy segment of $269.8 million, and at the East segment of $59.5 million, was partially offset by a decline in the West segment of $187.3 million. In 2014, the West segment represented 46.2% of total revenue, the Energy segment represented 30.3%, and the East segment was 23.5% of total revenue. Revenue from acquisitions made in 2014 and 2013 added $18.9 million to revenue.\nGross Profit\n2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit decreased by $16.2 million, or 6.9% compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of the 7.5% decrease in revenues and to inefficiencies associated with stopping and starting projects as a result of the weather delays in the Gulf States during the first half of 2015.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 11.4% from 11.3% from the same period in 2014.\n2014 and 2013\nGross profit for 2014 decreased by $20.0 million, or 7.8%, from 2013. As discussed in the segment results below, the decrease in gross profit was $47.3 million in the West segment. Gross profit for the Energy segment increased by $25.9 million and increased by $1.4 million for the East segment. Gross profit from acquisitions made in 2014 and 2013 added $3.0 million to 2014 gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 13.2% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2014 as a result of the large decrease in both revenue and gross profit in the West segment\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n2015 and 2014\nSelling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, office rent and utilities and acquisition costs. For 2015, SG&A expenses were $152.1 million, compared to $132.2 million in 2014, an increase of $19.9 million. Of the increase, $3.9 million was from the 2015 acquisition of Aevenia and $1.6 million of the increase was due to the impact of the 2014 acquisitions of Vadnais, Surber and Ram-Fab. Of the remaining $14.4 million increase, professional fees increased by $9.1 million, we recorded a one-time valuation adjustment for the value of a long-term asset of $2.6 million and the remaining $2.7 million increase represented expenses associated with increased compensation and staffing levels. The majority of the increase in professional fees was an increase in legal fees associated with our collection efforts on the disputed receivables discussed later in this Item and the expenses incurred in our ongoing internal review of the methods used by our subsidiaries to recognize revenue and estimate contingencies for ongoing projects as discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cWe may not be successful in continuing to meet the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on form 10-K. In addition, the increase in professional fees included fees associated with our efforts to improve our documentation of internal controls over financial reporting.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to 7.9% compared to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of both increased expenses and the decrease in revenues in 2015.\n2014 and 2013\nSG&A expenses were $132.2 million in 2014 compared to $130.8 million in 2013. The prior year included one-time expenses of $5.7 million related to impairment costs. Excluding the one-time expenses, SG&A in 2014 increased $7.1 million, or 5.7%, which included an increase of $1.4 million as a result of the 2014 acquisitions of Vadnais, Surber and Ram-Fab. Remaining increases were due to increases in compensation and benefits, marketing and communications expenses and professional fees.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 6.3% for 2014, from 6.7% for 2013.\nOther income and expense\nNon-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\n\nThere was no income from non-consolidated investments for 2015. For 2014, income from non-consolidated investments was primarily from the sale of our interest of the WesPac Energy non-consolidated joint venture, and for 2013, the loss from non-consolidated investments included an impairment expense and operating loss totalling $5.5 million for the WesPac Energy joint venture, partially offset by a $0.7 million profit from a 49% owned investment, Alvah, Inc.\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the United States dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. Many of our contracts in Calgary, Canada are sold based on United States dollars, but a portion of the work is paid for with Canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of the net reversal of $1.9 million in contingent consideration as Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber missed financial targets contemplated in their respective purchase agreements. Net other expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to adjustments to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Q3C, Surber and Vadnais. Net other income for 2013 was $4.8 million. The major components include $6.5 million as reductions in the liability for contingent consideration since the PPS, Saxon and FSSI acquisitions did not meet the performance targets outlined in their purchase agreements. The income was partially offset by increases of $2.5 million in the fair value of the liabilities for contingent consideration recorded throughout 2013 for acquisitions, including Q3C.\nInterest income is derived from interest earned on excess cash invested primarily in short term U.S. Treasury bills, backed by the federal government, and other investments that may not be backed by the federal government.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million, compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2014 due to increased equipment debt financing and additional borrowing under the Company's agreement for senior secured notes. The increased interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to increases in equipment debt financing, and a full year of interest on a $25 million long-term note drawn-down in July 2013.\nThe weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 2.9%, 3.0% and 3.3%, respectively.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income tax decreased $14.7 million to $23.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the decrease in pretax profits. The effective tax rate on income before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 39.19% and 37.77% for the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 39.37% for the year 2015 and 37.96% for 2014. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate was the impact of partially non-deductible per diem expenses, which while decreasing by $5.2 million in 2015, were a greater percentage of pre-tax income.\nOur provision for income tax decreased $6.3 million to $38.6 million for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of decreased pretax profits between the years and a decrease in our effective tax rate.\nSegment Results\nThe following discussion describes the significant factors contributing to the results of our three operating segments. All intersegment revenues and gross profit, which were immaterial, have been eliminated in the following tables.\nWest Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the West segment for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\n\n2015 and 2014\nWest segment revenue for 2015 decreased by $50.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2014. Revenue declined at the ARB Industrial division by $105.0 million with $80.2 million of the decrease the result of completion of a solar plant project in the Mojave Desert in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by increases at ARB Structures and Q3C totaling $62.2 million. The ARB Structures revenue increase was driven primarily by work on a large parking structure in southern California, and the Q3C revenue increase was attributable primarily to additional work performed for its largest customer, a gas and electric utility, totaling $27.6 million.\nGross profit for the West segment decreased by $13.2 million or 9.2% for 2015 versus 2014. The primary reason was a reduction of gross profit at both ARB Industrial and Rockford totaling $17.4 million, offset by an increase at ARB Underground of $5.1 million. The declines were due to the reduction in revenue at ARB Industrial and the impact of the rain in the second quarter on the pipeline operations of Rockford. The increase realized by ARB Underground was driven largely by increased MSA work performed for a major public gas and electric utility customer under its Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.3% in 2015 compared to 14.9% in 2014, still consistent with historical ratios. This decline in margin is largely attributable to Rockford's margin decrease from 11.6% in 2014 to 8.6% in 2015 reflecting a reduced level of work in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the rainy weather on a large diameter pipeline job in the Houston, TX area.\n2014 and 2013\nWest segment revenue in 2014 decreased by $187.3 million, or 16.3%, compared to 2013. Revenue declined at Rockford by $175.6 million primarily as a result of the completion of several large projects in 2013 and a $102 million decrease for a customer in the Marcellus shale region. Revenue decreased by $41.8 million at the ARB Underground division primarily due to reduced revenue of $23.2 million from traditional MSA customers, a decline of $40.1 million for one-time projects completed in 2013 partially offset by an increase in pipeline integrity work for a large gas utility customer. ARB Industrial division revenues declined by $21.8 million as a result of an $84.3 million decrease from the substantial completion of a major power plant project in 2013. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $53.2 million for construction of a solar plant project in the Mojave Desert in 2014. Finally, revenue at Q3C increased $62.2 million compared to 2013 due primarily to increase in work for a large utility located in the north central United States.\nGross profit for the West segment decreased by $47.3 million or 24.8%. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction of gross profit at ARB of $54.3 million. The declines were due to a combination of the close out of a major power plant project, the substantial completion of the Blythe joint venture project, the mix of MSA jobs at ARB Underground and the decline in revenue including $4.4 million less equipment cost absorption by the jobs as a result of the lower activity levels in 2014 compared to 2013. Gross profit at Rockford decreased by $5.1 million while gross profit at Q3C increased by $13.5 million, with the revenue at the operating units serving as the primary driver of gross profit changes.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14.9% in 2014 compared to 16.6% in 2013. The percentage in 2013 was higher than our historical percentages, which have ranged from 13% to 16% of revenue as a result of the substantial completion in 2013 of a power plant project by the ARB Industrial division. In addition, ARB Industrial recorded revenue of $29.5 million in 2013 and revenue of $82.6 million in 2014 for construction services at a large solar project in the Mojave Desert. Because of uncertainty as to collectability at the end of the cost-reimbursable project, we recorded revenues equal to cost for this project. Excluding the revenue and cost of this project, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have been 16.3% for 2014 compared to 17.0% for 2013.\nEast Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the East segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\n\n2015 and 2014\nEast segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $122.2 million, or 25.0% from 2014. The increase was due primarily to JCG's infrastructure and maintenance division work at a large petrochemical facility project in Louisiana.\nEast segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $16.8 million, or 65.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was due primarily to the increased revenue for the JCG infrastructure and maintenance division petrochemical project in Louisiana. Gross profit decreased at both JCG's heavy civil division and Cardinal Contractors. Gross profit for JCG heavy civil division projects decreased by $15.3 million primarily from delays at the Texas DOT projects in the Belton, TX area, and Cardinal Contractors gross profits decreased by $4.9 million, primarily from reduced margins for two Texas wastewater projects.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 6.9 % in 2015 compared to 5.3% in 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue for the East segment increased by $59.5 million, or 13.8% from 2013. Of the increase, $66.1 million was at JCG's heavy civil and infrastructure and maintenance divisions due primarily to increases of $42.8 million in Texas DOT revenue and an increase of $40.2 million in Mississippi DOT revenue. The increases were partially offset by a reduction of $19.1 million in Louisiana DOT revenue. Additionally, Cardinal Contractor's revenue decreased by $8.9 million, reflecting decreased work in the wastewater facility market in Florida.\nGross profit for the East segment increased by $1.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2013. The increased percentage was lower than the revenue growth primarily as a result of reduced gross profit of $1.9 million for JCG heavy civil projects offset by increases of $1.8 million at JCG's infrastructure and maintenance divisions and $0.6 million for Cardinal Contractor's projects. Heavy civil experienced a $7.9 million decrease in gross profit due to both the impact of the lower Louisiana DOT revenues and reduced gross profit on Texas DOT work. This decrease was partially offset by gross profit increases of $5.6 million in other heavy civil work, primarily on Mississippi DOT projects.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.3 % in 2014 compared to 5.6% in 2013 primarily as a result of the lower gross profit Texas and Louisiana heavy civil projects.\nEnergy Segment\nRevenue and gross profit for the Energy segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\n\n2015 and 2014\nRevenue for the Energy segment decreased by $228.6 million, or 36.2% from 2014. The PES Industrial division revenue decreased by $116.0 million, primarily due to completion of a fertilizer plant project in 2014, and the impact of the unusually severe rainy weather during the first half of the year, which delayed our ability to start work for a chemical plant project in Louisiana. PES's pipeline division revenue decreased by $113.9 million as a result of completion of a pipeline project in 2014. For the PES Saxon division, revenue decreased by $36.6 million as a result of a 2014 completion of a project in the Houston Ship Channel, partially offset by increases from two projects in Pennsylvania. OnQuest and OnQuest Canada revenue in 2015 increased by $9.6 million as a result of an LNG project in Florida. Revenue for Aevenia, acquired on February 28, 2015, was $23.7 million.\nGross profit for the Energy segment decreased by $19.8 million, or 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. The PES industrial division, PES pipeline division and the PES Saxon division gross profit decreased $27.1 million as a result of the reduction in revenue. PES's Specialty division gross profit increased $3.6 million as a result of the completion of a chilled water project in Texas. Aevenia's gross profit was $2.4 million.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 11.7% in 2015 compared to 10.6% in 2014. The increase was primarily the result of two offsetting factors. The first was due to the effect of zero margin work on a large pipeline project at the PES Pipeline division in 2014 and it's resulting lower prior year gross profit margin percentage. Offsetting this was reduced 2015 gross profits caused by the heavy rains during the first half of 2015 and decreased labor efficiency rates.\n2014 and 2013\nRevenue for the Energy segment increased by $269.8 million, or 74.5% from 2013. The PES Industrial division revenue increased by $129.0 million primarily from work activity at petrochemical facilities in south Louisiana. PES's PPS division revenue increased by $85.5 million as a result of increased revenues from capital projects. PES's Saxon division revenue increased by $17.1\nmillion and OnQuest and OnQuest Canada revenue in 2014 increased by $21.5 million as a result of additional revenue from construction of a micro LNG facility in 2014.\nGross profit for the Energy segment increased by $25.9 million, or 63.1%, compared to 2013. The PES Industrial division gross profit increased $14.6 million primarily due to the division's increased revenues. PES's PPS division gross profit increased $4.1 million due to increased revenues and the Saxon division gross profit increased $3.7 million as a result of increased revenues and improved profit margins compared to 2013. OnQuest and OnQuest Canada profit margins in 2014 increased by $1.5 million due to increased revenues.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.6% in 2014 compared to 11.3% in 2013 primarily as a result of the reduced margins at PES's PPS division. Similar to ARB Industrial, PPS recorded revenues equal to cost for a large pipeline project for which we have concerns about collectability of the full contractual amount. In 2013, PPS recorded revenue of $9.2 million and in 2014, PPS recorded revenue of $121.2 million for the project. Excluding the revenue of this project, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have been 13.0% for 2014 compared to 11.6% for 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Needs\nLiquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund business operations and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our net cash flow. If needed, we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis. We may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock, convertible notes, term debt or increasing our credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $161.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $170.5 million at December 31, 2014. We anticipate that our cash and investments on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our operating needs, our planned capital expenditures and our ability to grow for at least the next twelve months.\nThe construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. Historically, we have invested an amount that approximated the sum of depreciation and amortization expenses plus proceeds from equipment sales. In 2015, capital expenditures were approximately $67.1 million. For 2015, the amount of depreciation, amortization and equipment sales was approximately $75.1 million. Capital expenses are expected to total $55 to $60 million for 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash flows during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:\n\nOperating Activities\nThe source of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2015 of $48.4 million increased by $12.3 million compared to 2014. This increase was caused by the $6.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization, the reduced provision for income taxes of $14.7 million, offset by the decrease in operating income of $36.0 million and due to the $46.3 million net changes in assets and liabilities in 2015 compared to the net change of $88.7 million in 2014.\nThe components of the $46.3 million change in assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:\n\u00b7 an increase of $2.1 million in customer retention deposits;\n\u00b7 a decrease of $19.5 million in accounts receivable, primarily as a result of a decrease of $17.7 million in amounts retained by customers as we have completed major projects. At December 31, 2015, accounts receivable represented 28.3% of our total assets compared to 30.4% at the end of 2014. In general, we continue to maintain an excellent collection history, and we have certain lien rights that can provide additional security for collections. However, as outlined in the section \u201cReceivable Collection Actions\u201d, we are in dispute resolution with two customers with a total receivable amount $50.8 million, or 16.0% of our total accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015;\n\u00b7 an increase of $47.5 million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Increases associated with the time lag from when revenues were earned until the customer can be billed were approximately $23.6 million for ARB, primarily for two large utility customers, and $22.6 million for JCG, primarily for public agency heavy civil projects which require inspector approval prior to billing;\n\u00b7 a decrease in inventory and other current assets of $4.9 million primarily as a result of the 2015 utilization of the prior year tax receivable;\n\u00b7 accounts payable decreased by $5.1 million, primarily impacted by the timing of vendor payments;\n\u00b7 a net decrease of $19.6 million in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings reflecting the timing of work progression and billings;\n\u00b7 a decrease of $6.7 million in contingent earn-out liabilities, from a payment of $5.0 million made in March 2015 and the reduction of the earn-out liability as a result of the Ram-Fab, Vadnais and Surber operations not meeting targets outlined in their purchase agreements; and\n\u00b7 a net increase of $11.7 million in accrued expenses, mainly due to an increase in workers compensation reserves.\nDuring the twelve months of 2015, we paid $18.7 million for income taxes compared to $57.6 million in the same period of the previous year. The reduction in net cash tax payments in 2015 was the result of a decrease in the Company's current tax provision and the utilization of significant prepayments from 2014.\nInvesting activities\n\nWe purchased property and equipment for $67.1 million, $88.0 million and $89.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally for our construction activities. We believe the ownership of equipment is generally preferable to renting equipment on a project-by-project basis, as ownership helps to ensure the equipment is available for our workloads when needed. In addition, ownership has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs.\nWe periodically sell equipment, typically to update our fleet. We received proceeds from the sale of used equipment of $9.9 million, $5.8 million and $7.9 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we did not purchase any short-term investments, while we invested $33.8 million and $23.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, in short-term investments. We sold short-term investments amounting to $31.0 million, $21.5 million and $7.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Short-term investments consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury bills with various financial institutions.\nWe used $22.3 million in cash for the Aevenia acquisition, $14.6 million in cash for the Vadnais and Surber/Ram-Fab/Williams acquisitions in 2014 and $2.3 million in cash for the FSSI acquisition in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $21.8 million in 2015. Significant transactions impacting cash flows from financing activities included:\n\u00b7 $50.3 million in new and refinanced notes secured by our equipment and by a mortgage note on two buildings;\n\u00b7 $25.0 million in new debt under the Company's Note Agreement;\n\u00b7 $43.9 million in repayment of long-term debt and the repayment of $1.3 million in capital leases;\n\u00b7 $0.03 million in payments of accumulated earnings to the Blythe non-controlling interest holder;\n\u00b7 Dividend payments of $9.8 million to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015; and\n\u00b7 $1.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of 96,828 shares of common stock purchased by the participants in the Primoris Long-term Retention Plan.\nDebt Activities\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a revolving credit facility, as amended on December 12, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with The PrivateBank and Trust Company, as administrative agent (the \u201cAdministrative Agent\u201d) and co-lead arranger, The Bank of the West, as co-lead arranger, and IBERIABANK Corporation, Branch Banking and Trust Company and UMB Bank, N.A. (the \u201cLenders\u201d). The Credit Agreement is a $125 million revolving credit facility whereby the Lenders agree to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to the $125 million committed amount. The termination date of the Credit Agreement is December 28, 2017.\nThe principal amount of any loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either: (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin as specified in the Credit Agreement (based on the Company's senior debt to EBITDA ratio as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement), or (ii) the Base Rate (which is the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or (b) the prime rate as announced by the Administrative Agent). Quarterly non-use fees, letter of credit fees and administrative agent fees are payable at rates specified in the Credit Agreement.\nThe principal amount of any loan drawn under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part, with a minimum prepayment of $5 million, at any time, potentially subject to make-whole provisions.\nThe Credit Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants for facilities of this type, as discussed below.\nCommercial letters of credit outstanding were $12.1 million at December 31, 2015 and $4.7 million at December 31, 2014. Other than commercial letters of credit, there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2015 was $112.9 million.\nSenior Secured Notes and Shelf Agreement\nOn December 28, 2012, the Company entered into a $50 million Senior Secured Notes purchase (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and a $25 million private shelf agreement (the \u201cNotes Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, The Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and certain Prudential affiliates (the \u201cNoteholders\u201d). On June 3, 2015, the Notes Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance of additional notes of up to $75 million over the next three year period ending June 3, 2018 (\u201cAdditional Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe Senior Notes amount was funded on December 28, 2012. The Senior Notes are due December 28, 2022 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.65%, paid quarterly in arrears. Annual principal payments of $7.1 million are required from December 28, 2016 through December 28, 2021 with a final payment due on December 28, 2022. The principal amount may be prepaid, with a minimum prepayment of $5 million, at any time, subject to make-whole provisions.\nOn July 25, 2013, the Company drew $25 million available under the Notes Agreement. The notes are due July 25, 2023 and bear interest at an annual rate of 3.85% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from July 25, 2017 with a final payment due on July 25, 2023.\nOn November 9, 2015, the Company drew $25 million available under the Additional Senior Notes Agreement. The notes are due November 9, 2025 and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.6% paid quarterly in arrears. Seven annual principal payments of $3.6 million are required from November 9, 2019 with a final payment due on November 9, 2025.\nLoans made under both the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement are secured by our assets, including, among others, our cash, inventory, goods, equipment (excluding equipment subject to permitted liens) and accounts receivable. All of our domestic subsidiaries have issued joint and several guaranties in favor of the Lenders and Noteholders for all amounts under the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement.\nBoth the Credit Agreement and the Notes Agreement contain various restrictive and financial covenants including among others, minimum tangible net worth, senior debt/EBITDA ratio, debt service coverage requirements and a minimum balance for unencumbered net book value for fixed assets. In addition, the agreements include restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event the Company disposes more than 20% of its total assets.\nThe Company was in compliance with the covenants for the Credit Agreement and Notes Agreement at December 31, 2015.\nCanadian Credit Facility\nThe Company has a demand credit facility for $8.0 million in Canadian dollars with a Canadian bank for purposes of issuing commercial letters of credit in Canada. The credit facility has an annual renewal and provides for the issuance of commercial letters of credit for a term of up to five years. The facility provides for an annual fee of 1% for any issued and outstanding commercial letters of credit. Letters of credit can be denominated in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, letters of credit outstanding totaled $2.2 million and $2.6 million in Canadian dollars, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the available borrowing capacity was $5.8 million in Canadian dollars. The credit facility contains a working capital restrictive covenant for our Canadian subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. At December 31, 2015, OnQuest Canada, ULC was in compliance with the covenant.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $275.3 million of outstanding long-term debt and capital lease obligations. There were no short-term borrowings.\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\n\n(1) The interest amount represents interest payments for our fixed rate debt assuming that principal payments are made as originally scheduled.\nThe table does not include obligations under multi-employer pension plans in which some of our employees participate. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates are generally specified in our collective bargaining agreements, and contributions are made to the plans based on employee payrolls. Our obligations for future periods cannot be determined because we cannot predict the number of employees that we will employ at any given time nor the plans in which they may participate.\nWe may also be required to make additional contributions to multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these contributions will be determined based on our union payroll. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules for multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers. The amounts of additional funds that we may be obligated to contribute cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the table above.\nIn November 2011, members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (\u201cPLCA\u201d), including ARB, Rockford and Q3C (prior to the Company's acquisition in 2012), withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund multiemployer pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d). These withdrawals were made in order to mitigate additional liability in connection with the significantly underfunded Plan. The Company recorded a withdrawal liability of $7.5 million, which was increased to $7.6 million after the acquisition of Q3C, based on information provided by the Plan. The Plan asserted that the PLCA members did not affect a proper withdrawal in 2011, and in May 2014, the Plan asserted that the total liability for the Company was $11.8 million. A legal proceeding commenced, and a United States District Court ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members in 2011 was not effective. The PLCA appealed this decision, but as required by the Plan, the Company began making monthly payments which have totaled $1.8 million through December 31, 2015. These payments have been expensed.\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and ruled that the withdrawal was effective in 2011 as had been asserted by the PLCA. The Company has received a revised withdrawal liability calculation from the Plan at an amount approximately equal to the company's accrual amount. The Company and other members of the PLCA are engaged in arbitration to further reduce the amount owed. The Company is making payments while awaiting the results of the arbitration process. The Company has no plans to withdraw from any other agreements.\nWe have also excluded from the table any interest and fees associated with letters of credit and commitment fees under our credit facility since these amounts are unknown and variable.\nRelated Party Transactions\nPrimoris has entered into leasing transactions with Stockdale Investment Group, Inc. (\u201cSIGI\u201d). Brian Pratt, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and our largest stockholder, holds a majority interest and is the chairman, president and chief executive officer and a director of SIGI. John M. Perisich, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, is secretary of SIGI.\nPrimoris leases properties from SIGI at the following locations:\n1. Bakersfield, California (lease expires October 2022)\n2. Pittsburg, California (lease expires April 2023)\n3. San Dimas, California (lease expires March 2019)\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $0.83 million, $0.86 million and $0.91 million, respectively, in lease payments to SIGI for the use of these properties.\nPrimoris leases a property from Roger Newnham, a former owner and current manager of our subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC. The property is located in Calgary, Canada. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 Primoris paid $0.25 million, $0.29 million and $0.30 million, respectively, in lease payments. The current term of the lease will expire on December 31, 2017.\nPrimoris leases a property from Lemmie Rockford, one of the Rockford sellers, which commenced November 1, 2011. The property is located in Toledo, Washington. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Primoris paid $0.09 million each year, in lease payments. The lease will expire in January 2017.\nPrimoris leases a property from Quality RE Partners, owned by three of the Q3C selling shareholders, of whom two are current employees, including Jay Osborn, an operations president in the West Construction segment. The property is located in Little\nCanada, Minnesota. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $0.27 million, $0.26 million and $0.26 million, respectively, in lease payments to Quality RE Partners. The lease expires in October 2022. In addition, in November 2015, Q3C purchased construction equipment at fair value from Quality RE Partners for $0.6 million. Q3C also leased construction equipment from Mr. Osborn during 2015 for $0.04 million and subsequently purchased the equipment at fair value for $0.145 million.\nWe believe that the amounts that we pay for the leases approximate terms that we could obtain from independent third parties. In addition, related party transactions, any new leases, extensions of lease terms and changes in lease terms or amounts must be approved in advance by the independent directors of the Board of Directors Audit Committee.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs is common in our industry, we enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected on our balance sheet. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangement with variable interest entities. The following represent transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered material off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\u00b7 Letters of credit issued under our lines of credit. At December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit outstanding of $13.7 million, primarily for international projects in our Energy segment, a large domestic pipeline project and for providing security to our insurance carriers. These letters of credit are used by some of our carriers to ensure reimbursement for amounts that they are disbursing on our behalf, such as beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance program. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post a letter of credit to ensure payments to our subcontractors or guarantee performance under our contracts. Letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement and Canadian Credit Facility. If these letters of credit were drawn on by the beneficiary, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, and we may be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit.\n\u00b7 We enter into non-cancellable operating leases for some of our facilities, equipment and vehicles, including leases with related parties. At December 31, 2015, equipment operating leases had a remaining commitment of $14.2 million and facility rental commitments were $18.8 million.\n\u00b7 Employment agreements which provide for compensation and benefits under certain circumstances and which may contain a change of control clause. We may be obligated to make payments under the terms of these agreements.\n\u00b7 In the ordinary course of our business, we may be required by our customers to post surety bid or completion bonds in connection with services that we provide. At December 31, 2015, we had $1.48 billion in outstanding bonds. We do not believe that it is likely that we would have to fund material claims under our surety arrangements.\n\u00b7 Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions. In most instances, these agreements require that we contribute to multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. For many plans, the contributions are determined annually and required future contributions cannot be determined since contribution rates depend on the total number of union employees and actuarial calculations based on the demographics of all participants. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Amendments Act of 1980, subject employers to potential liabilities in the event of an employer's complete or partial withdrawal of an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules that are classified as \u201cendangered\u201d, \u201cseriously endangered\u201d, or \u201ccritical\u201d status. As discussed in Note 18 - \u201cMultiemployer Plans\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have recognized a withdrawal liability for one plan. We currently do not anticipate withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plans. Withdrawal liabilities or requirements for increased future contributions could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity; and\n\u00b7 Other guarantees that we make from time to time, such as guaranteeing the obligations of our subsidiaries.\nReceivable Collection Actions\nAs all construction contractors, we negotiate payments with our customers from time to time, and we may encounter delays in receiving payments from our customers. However, in 2014, we encountered unusual situations with two contracts. In one instance, ARB Industrial performed work on a solar plant in the Mojave Desert. Based on our concerns about eventual collectability for the cost-reimbursable contract and in spite of many assurances of payment from the owner, we chose to recognize revenue equal to cost. At the end of the project, the owner chose not to pay the final amounts due totaling $32.9 million. We are currently engaged in\nalternative dispute resolution as required by the contract. The owner has bonded around the liens that we filed, and we believe that action will enhance collectability of amounts due at the end of the dispute process.\nIn addition, a division of PES constructed a large capital pipeline for a customer in Texas. During the early stages of the project, we became concerned that the customer would not pay us for ancillary items as we believe is required by the contract. As a result of our concerns about eventual collectability, we chose to recognize revenue equal to cost. We have initiated legal action and filed liens to collect our $17.9 million receivable.\nThe Company has specific reserves of approximately $26 million for these two projects included in \u201cbillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d. While we believe that in both instances we are owed the full amount of the receivable, there can be no guarantee of the final amount that we receive or the timing of a resolution of the two matters.\n2016 Outlook\nWe believe that we have market growth opportunities in 2016 and well into 2017 even if the price of oil remains at a depressed level for 2016. We do note that the increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental requirements for many of our client's infrastructure improvements and impact of the reduced oil price create uncertainty as to the timing of some of our opportunities. We believe that Primoris has the financial and operational strength to meet these short-term challenges, and we continue to be optimistic about longer-term opportunities. Specifically, our view of the outlook for our major end markets currently is as follows:\n\u00b7 Construction of petroleum, natural gas, and natural gas liquid pipelines - We expect that at the current oil price, activities in most if not all of the shale basins will be reduced or eliminated significantly reducing any upstream work such as gathering lines and petroleum transport pipelines for the near future. If production from the shale formations continues to increase in the near future, the current disconnect between production and processing locations provides opportunities for our underground construction operations serving midstream companies, primarily Rockford, ARB Underground and Primoris Pipeline & Maintenance groups. We expect that the efforts by gas utilities to move shale gas from the Marcellus region to Florida and other Atlantic states will continue and will provide significant opportunity for Rockford over the next 2-3 years.\n\u00b7 Inspection, maintenance and replacement of gas utility infrastructure -We expect that continuing safety enhancements to the gas utility infrastructure will provide continuing opportunities for our ARB Underground operations, especially in California, as well as Q3C in the Midwest. We also expect that ongoing gas utility repair and maintenance opportunities will continue to grow benefiting our Q3C and PES groups.\n\u00b7 Construction of natural gas-fired power plants and heavy industrial plants - We expect continued construction opportunities for both base-load and peak shaving power plants; however, we are aware that concerns expressed in California that power plants are not \u201cacceptable\u201d for environmental reasons may impact the timing of near term construction opportunities. We believe that based on continuing population growth, the intermittency of renewable power resources and the environmental requirements associated with using ocean water for cooling, power plants will be needed in spite of vocal opposition to \u201cnon-green\u201d sources. In addition, the current low price of natural gas could result in the conversion of coal-fired power plants and conversion and expansion at chemical plants and industrial facilities in other parts of the United States. These opportunities would benefit our ARB Industrial group and PES Industrial group.\n\u00b7 Construction of alternative energy facilities, wind farms, solar energy - We anticipate continued construction opportunities as state governments remain committed to renewable power standards, primarily benefitting ARB Industrial and to a lesser degree our PES group.\n\u00b7 Transportation infrastructure construction opportunities - We believe that passing of longer term highway funding by the federal government in 2015 and voter approval of a highway funding proposition 7 in Texas will provide increased opportunity for our heavy civil and highway groups especially in Texas. We expect that opportunities in the Louisiana market may improve but will remain at depressed levels except for specific programs. This market primarily impacts the operations of JCG.\n\u00b7 Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities-We believe the LNG on-purpose opportunities for rail, barge, and other transportation needs will continue to grow, albeit at a slow pace. This market will primarily impact our OnQuest and PES groups. We further believe the existing large scale LNG export facilities currently being planned will require services that will benefit our PES and JCG groups for field services.\nPlease note that our 2016 outlook and 2016 financial results could be adversely impacted by many factors including those discussed in Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This \u201c2016 Outlook\u201d consists of forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the cautions about forward looking statements found at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBacklog\nFor companies in the construction industry, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We define backlog is defined as a combination of: (1) anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts for which we have known revenue amounts for fixed price and fixed unit price contracts (\u201cFixed Backlog\u201d), and (2) the estimated revenues on MSA's for the next four quarters (\u201cMSA Backlog\u201d). We normally do not include time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts in the calculation of backlog, when their ultimate revenue amount is difficult to estimate in advance.\nThe two components of backlog, Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog, are detailed below.\nFixed Backlog\nFixed Backlog by operating segment and the changes in Fixed Backlog for the periods ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows, in millions:\n\n\n\nRevenues recognized from non-Fixed Backlog projects shown above are generated by MSA projects and projects completed under time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable-plus-fee contracts.\nAt December 31, 2015, our total Fixed Backlog was $1.52 billion, representing a decrease of $30.8 million, or 2.0%, from $1.55 billion as of December 31, 2014.\nMSA Backlog\nThe following table outlines historical MSA revenues for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 ($ in millions):\n\nMSA Backlog includes anticipated MSA revenues for the next twelve months. We determined estimated MSA revenues based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers.\nTotal Backlog\nThe following table shows the makeup of total backlog, both Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog, by operating segment at December 31, 2015 (in millions).\n\nWe expect that during 2016, we will recognize as revenue approximately 86% of the West segment total backlog at December 31, 2015, approximately 52% of the East segment backlog and approximately 99% of the Energy segment backlog.\nBacklog should not be considered a comprehensive indicator of future revenues, as a percentage of our revenues are derived from projects that are not part of a backlog calculation. The backlog estimates include amounts from estimated MSA revenues, but our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs. Any of our contracts, MSA, fixed price or fixed unit price, may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements or project specific issues. Future revenues from projects completed under time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable-plus-fee contracts may not be included in our estimated backlog amount.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors.", "item_7_tables": "Table 15: <table> <tr> <td> Subsidiary\n</td>

operating in three segments: West, East, and Energy. Key end markets include underground utility projects, industrial facilities, heavy civil, and engineering projects.\n\n2015 Financial Results\n- Revenue was $1.9 billion, down 7.5% compared to 2014, primarily due to severe weather and completion of large projects. \n- Gross profit margin was 11.4%, up slightly from 11.3% in 2014.\n- SG&A increased due to higher professional fees, valuation adjustments, and compensation costs. \n- Net income attributable to Primoris was $36.9 million or 1.9% of revenue.\n\nBacklog \n- At December 31, 2015, backlog was $2.1 billion, comprised of $1.5 billion in fixed backlog and $0.6 billion in MSA backlog. This is a slight decrease from 2014.\n- The company expects to recognize 86% of the West segment backlog and 99% of the Energy segment backlog in 2016.\n\nOutlook\n- Continued opportunities are expected in gas utility infrastructure, power plant construction, transportation infrastructure, and LNG facilities, partially offset by reduced oil/gas pipeline work.\n- Regulatory and permitting uncertainties could impact timing of some projects.\n\nKey challenges include uncertainty around oil prices, timing of opportunities, and potential project delays. However, Primoris believes it has the strength to meet near-term challenges."}
