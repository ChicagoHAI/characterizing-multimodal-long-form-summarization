Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody and other protein therapeutics to treat severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. We are developing a suite of clinical-stage drug candidates from our proprietary XmAb\u00ae technology platforms that are designed to treat cancer, autoimmune and allergic diseases, and other conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches to antibody design, which focus on the portion of antibodies that interact with target antigens, our protein engineering efforts and the XmAb technologies are focused on the portion of the antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. This portion, referred to as the Fc domain, is constant and interchangeable among antibodies. Our engineered Fc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains.\nWe believe our Fc domains enhance antibody performance by, for example, increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half-life, or stabilizing novel antibody and other protein structures, while maintaining 99.5% identity in structure and sequence to natural antibodies. The most recent expansion of our platform is the XmAb bispecific Fc domains, which enable the rapid design and simplified development of antibodies, and other protein structures, that bind two or more different targets simultaneously. By designing antibodies and other protein molecules with improved function, we believe that our XmAb-engineered proteins offer innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantages over other treatments.\nOur business strategy is based on the plug-and-play nature of the XmAb technology, allowing us to create new antibody drug candidates for our internal development or licensing, or to selectively license access to one or more of our XmAb technologies to pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to use in developing their own proprietary antibodies with improved properties. Our protein engineering capabilities and the modular nature of our technology allows us to quickly identify and create multiple drug candidates for potential development. We have applied our XmAb technology to:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndevelop a pipeline of drug candidates from our bispecific Fc domains that we are developing on our own and with our partners,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndevelop XmAb antibody candidates from our other Fc technologies through early stage of development and then license them to partners for continued development, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n3.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napply our Fc technologies to partner created antibodies. These transactions generally require very little effort on our part.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur many partnerships and licensing transactions provide us with multiple revenue streams that help fund development of our product candidates and usually require limited resources or efforts from us. In 2018, we received $20.5 million in milestones from our partners and in February 2019, we announced a collaboration with Genentech for which we will receive an upfront payment of $120 million. There are currently 12 antibody product candidates in clinical trials that have been engineered with XmAb technology, two additional candidates have IND applications allowed by the FDA and will begin Phase 1 trials in 2019, and two more programs are in the preclinical stage of development.\nIn December 2018, the FDA approved the first antibody that incorporates our Fc technology. ALXN1210, now Ultomiris\u2122, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial marketing. Ultomiris is a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), that is being developed by our partner Alexion, and incorporates our Xtend\u00ae Fc technology which allows for longer duration of action and less frequent dosing regimens compared to the previously approved therapy, Soliris\u00ae. There are five additional clinical candidates being advanced by licensees and development partners.\nWe have created a suite of compounds developed from our XmAb bispecific Fc domains that we wholly-own or are developing with our partners. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates.\nThe initial bispecific candidates that we designed were created with our engineered heterodimer Fc domain, or bispecific Fc domain, and are dual-antigen targeting molecules, containing an anti-tumor associated antigen binding domain and a second binding domain targeted to CD3, an activating receptor on T-cells. We are advancing three CD3 bispecific candidates through clinical development: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, and XmAb18087.\nTable 185: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nXmAb14045 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD123, an antigen on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and leukemic stem cells, and CD3, a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is being developed in collaboration with our partner Novartis and is being evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We presented initial data from the study in December 2018 at ASH. The data presented indicated multiple complete responses had been achieved with weekly dosing of XmAb14045 in this heavily-pretreated patient population. 28% of evaluable AML patients achieved either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete homological recovery (CRi) at the two highest dose levels studies to date.\nIn February 2019, we received notice from the FDA placing the XmAb14045 study on partial clinical hold due to safety issues of cytokine release syndrome and pulmonary toxicities. Under the partial hold, existing subjects on the trial may continue to receive dosing; however, no new subjects may be enrolled pending FDA review of a clinical hold response.\nThe partial hold was initiated following recent safety reports Xencor submitted to the FDA on two patient deaths that were considered at least possibly related to XmAb14045. One patient experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after their first dose, the treatment of which was complicated by the patient's decision to withdraw care. One subject developed acute pulmonary edema following several doses of XmAb14045. Items to be addressed in the response include analysis of CRS cases per dosing level, efficacy information, and strategies to mitigate the observed toxicities.\nWe are coordinating a response to the partial hold by the FDA with our partner, Novartis, and plan to continue development of XmAb14045 pending resolution of the partial hold.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nXmAb13676 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.

This program was also partnered with Novartis as part of our Novartis collaboration. In December 2018, as part of a strategic realignment of their pipeline, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights to XmAb13676, which is effective June 21, 2019. Under the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will be responsible for funding its share of the development costs for the program through June 2020. We plan to continue develop XmAb13676 as planned and expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 study in the second half of 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nXmAb18087 is a bispecific that targets somatostatin receptor 2, or SSTR2, and the cytotoxic T-cell binding domain CD3 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

These cytokines are built on our bispecific Fc domain and have potency tuned to improve therapeutic index. These candidates also incorporate our Xtend technology for longer duration of action. Our first cytokine candidate is XmAb24306, an IL15/IL15-receptior alpha complex fused to a bispecific domain (IL15/IL15Ra-Fc). We believe that IL-15 cytokines, like XmAb24306, will be an optimal candidate for oncology combination therapies.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nXmAb24306 is currently in IND-enabling studies, and we will support Genentech's efforts to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019. We believe a broad combination development strategy will be critical to realize the potential of IL-15 cytokines. In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, whereby the companies will co-develop XmAb24306 and other potential IL-15 programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have also created a suite of wholly-owned compounds using our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nXmAb5871 uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and targets CD19 with its variable domain, which is designed to inhibit the function of B cells, an important component of the immune system. We have completed Phase 2 clinical trials for XmAb5871 in three autoimmune diseases: SLE, IgG4-RD, and RA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2018, we presented topline data from the Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with no loss of improvement (LOI) (i.e. maintenance of improvement) in the efficacy-evaluable population. Improvement was maintained at Day 225 by 42% of patients in the XmAb5871-treated arm, compared to 28.6% of patients in the placebo-treated arm, which did not meet the primary endpoint for statistical significance.\nThe SLE study did meet secondary endpoints included evaluations of time to LOI. Patients in the efficacy-evaluable population treated with XmAb5871 experienced a statistically significant longer time to LOI, compared to placebo-treated patients, which represented a 76% improvement in median time to LOI and a 47% reduction in risk of LOI. XmAb5871 was well tolerated, and its safety profile was consistent with previous trials.\nIn November 2017 we presented final data from the IgG4-RD Phase 2 trial at the ACR annual meeting.\nWe have also completed an additional Phase 1 trial for a subcutaneous formulation of XmAb5871.\nWe believe that the data from the studies of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE and IgG4-RD support further development in these indications and show the potential of XmAb5871 in other B-cell mediated autoimmune indications. We are seeking to partner XmAb5871 with a partner that has the infrastructure and resources to continue late-stage development of XmAb5871 and maximize the potential of this candidate for a broad set of patient populations.\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nXmAb7195 uses our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and is being developed for the treatment of severe asthma and allergic diseases.

In 2017 we announced data from a Phase 1b trial for XmAb7195 with a subcutaneous formulation. The data from the trial showed that subcutaneous administration of XmAb7195 was well tolerated and effective at reducing free and total IgE levels in subjects in the study. The results support subcutaneous delivery for future development. We are seeking a development partner for XmAb7195.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have also created antibodies which we have licensed to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for further development. These include MOR208, an antibody in Phase 3 development, which we licensed to MorphoSys, and a CD38 x CD3 bispecific antibody candidate which included XmAb13551 and antibody components used to assemble AMG424, which we licensed to Amgen. In 2017 MorphoSys advanced MOR208 into a Phase 3 clinical trial and MorphoSys has indicated plans to file a BLA in the U.S. in 2019. Amgen has started a Phase 1 study for AMG424 and also has a preclinical candidate, AMG509, that was created with our bispecific Fc domain, advancing into development. There are currently five other programs where we have licensed our technology to partners for use in development programs with their own molecules, and four of these programs are in clinical development. The most advanced is Ultomiris, formerly ALXN1210. In 2018, Alexion submitted marketing authorization applications for Ultomiris to the regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and in December 2018, Alexion received FDA approval.\nWe have over 750 issued and pending patents worldwide to protect our XmAb technology platform and XmAb drug candidates.\nKey Company Milestones\nGenentech Collaboration: In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech (Genentech Agreement) to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics that use our bispecific Fc technology, including XmAb24306, in the areas of cancer immunotherapy. We will jointly collaborate on the worldwide development of XmAb24306 and other IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, each a Collaboration Product\u201d with Genentech maintaining worldwide commercialization rights, subject to us having a co-promotion option in the U.S. We retained the right to perform clinical studies of Collaboration Products in combination with other therapeutic agents, subject to certain requirements. Genentech received a worldwide exclusive license to the XmAb24306 and other Collaboration Products.\nUnder the Genentech Agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $120 million and are eligible to receive up to $160 million in clinical milestone payments for each Collaboration Product that advances to Phase 3 clinical trials. We are eligible to receive a 45% share of net profits from sales of XmAb24306 and other Collaboratio Products, while also sharing in the net losses at the same percentage rate and we will jointly share in 45% of development and commercialization costs. We will conduct a two-year joint research program with Genentech to discover additional programs around the IL-15 cytokine technology and will receive a $20 million milestone payment upon the initiation of each Phase 1 clinical trial for each new Collaboration Product developed under a research plan.\nThe Genentech Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and closing is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019.\nNovartis Collaboration. In June 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis (Novartis Agreement) to develop and commercialize bispecific and other Fc engineered antibody drug candidates using the Company's proprietary XmAb technologies and drug candidates. Under the Novartis Agreement, we licensed certain rights to our two lead bispecific candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, to Novartis including the right for Novartis to commercialize drug products from both programs in all worldwide territories outside the U.S. We are co-developing XmAb14045 worldwide and sharing development costs equally. We will also apply our bispecific technology to up to four Novartis identified antibodies and will also license other Fc technologies to Novartis. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $150 million and are eligible to receive up to $2.1 billion in milestone payments under the Novartis Agreement.\nIn December 2018, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights with respect to the XmAb13676 program. Novartis will continue to fund its share of development costs for the XmAb13676 program through June 2020 and we plan to continue development of the program.\nLicensing Partnerships. In addition to Novartis and Genentech collaborations, we have four other licensing partnerships for the licensing of our XmAb technology. These arrangements provide research funding, upfront payments and annual licensing fees in addition to potential milestones and contractual payments as our partners advance compounds that incorporate our technology through clinical development.\nDuring 2018, Alexion submitted regulatory filings for Ultomiris in the U.S., European Union and Japan. In December 2018, Alexion received approval from the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with PNH. We received a total of $20 million in regulatory milestone payments from Alexion for Ultomiris in 2018. In November 2018, Amgen began preclinical studies for AMG509, for intended clinical development for patients with prostate cancer, and we received a $0.5 million milestone payment.\nBispecific Fc programs. We continue to advance our pipeline with bispecific Fc antibodies and cytokines that incorporate our XmAb bispecific Fc domain, which allow us to create molecules that bind to multiple different targets. By using an Fc as an integral part of the molecule, we impart the advantages of natural antibody features, including enabling it to retain or enhance favorable half-life, simplifying manufacturing processes and modulating potency to reduce toxicity.\nWe have initiated the Phase 1 trials for four bispecific oncology candidates: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, and XmAb20717. We have received FDA approval of our IND applications for our next two candidates, XmAb22841 and XmAb23104, and we will be initiating Phase 1 trials in the first half of 2019. We are in preclinical development for our first bispecific Fc domain cytokine candidate, XmAb24306, and we plan to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019.\nIn March 2018, we completed the sale of 8,395,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten follow-on financing and raised net proceeds of $245.5 million after deducting underwriters' commissions and expense of the sale.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues\nOur revenues to date have been generated primarily from our collaboration agreements and our technology licensing agreements. Revenue recognized from our collaboration agreements includes non-refundable upfront payments and milestone payments while revenue from our technology licensing agreements includes upfront payments, annual maintenance fees, option payments to obtain commercial licenses and milestone payments. Since our inception through December 31, 2018, we have generated $266.2 million in revenues under the various product development partnership and technology license arrangements. Several of our product development partnership and technology license agreements provide us the opportunity to earn future milestone payments, royalties on product sales and option exercise payments.\nSummary of Collaboration and Licensing Revenue by Partner\nThe following is a comparison of collaboration and licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmgen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAlexion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCSL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMorphoSys\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovo Nordisk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovartis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related personnel costs, supplies, facility costs and preclinical testing costs, clinical trial costs and fees paid to external service providers. External service providers include contract research organizations (CRO) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) to conduct clinical trials, manufacturing and process development, IND-enabling toxicology testing and formulation of clinical drug supplies. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expense when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. We estimate contract manufacturing, preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to the contracts with manufacturing, research institutions and clinical research organizations that manufacture and conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf based on the actual time and expenses incurred by them. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the related agreement. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and adjust estimates accordingly. Our estimates of clinical trial expense have fluctuated on a period-to-period basis due to changes in the stage of the clinical trials and patient enrollment levels. We expect to experience a continuing pattern of fluctuations in clinical trial expenses as current clinical trials are completed and as we initiate additional and later stage clinical trials. To date, we have not experienced significant differences between our periodic estimates of clinical trial expense and the actual costs incurred. We expect changes in future clinical trial expenses to be driven by changes in service provider costs and changes in clinical stage and patient enrollment. We have incurred a total of $466.1 million in research and development expenses from inception through December 31, 2018.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses may increase over spending levels in recent years if we are successful in advancing XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, XmAb24306, or any of our other preclinical programs into advanced stages of clinical development. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Numerous factors may affect the probability of success for each product candidate, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability, approval by regulatory authorities and commercial viability.\nOur research and development operations are conducted such that design, management and evaluation of results of all of our research and development is performed internally, while the execution of certain phases of our research and development programs, such as toxicology studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and manufacturing in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), is accomplished using CROs and CMOs. We account for research and development costs on a program-by-program basis except in the early stages of research and discovery, when costs are often devoted to identifying preclinical candidates and improving our discovery platform and technologies, which are not necessarily allocable to a specific development program. We assign costs for such activities to distinct projects for preclinical pipeline development and new technologies. We allocate research management, overhead, commonly used laboratory supplies and equipment, and facility costs based on the number of full-time research personnel allocated to each program.\nThe following is a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nXmAb5871 programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nXmAb7195 program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBispecific programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCD-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTME checkpoints\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCytokines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubtotal Bispecific programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther, research and early stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n97.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n51.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation related to our executive, finance, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include rent and utilities, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services.\nOther Income, Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our investments during the years.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Our management believes judgment is involved in determining revenue recognition, the fair value-based measurement of stock-based compensation, the fair value estimate of marketable securities, the capitalization and recoverability of intellectual property costs, valuation of deferred tax assets and accruals. Our management evaluates estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences could be material to the financial statements. If our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have, to date, earned revenue from research and development collaborations, which may include research and development services, licenses of our internally-developed technologies, licenses of our internally-developed drug candidates, or combinations of these.\nThe terms of our license and research and development and collaboration agreements generally include non-refundable upfront payments, research funding, co-development reimbursements, license fees and, milestone and other contingent payments to us for the achievement of defined collaboration objectives and certain clinical, regulatory and sales-based events, as well as royalties on sales of any commercialized products.\nThe terms of our licensing agreements include non-refundable upfront fees, annual licensing fees, and contractual payment obligations for the achievement of pre-defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based events by our partners. The licensing agreements also include royalties on sales of any commercialized products by our partners.\nAs described in Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606. Subsequent to the adoption, the Company recognizes revenue through the five-step process in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue Recognition when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company used the full retrospective method and as a result the Company has revised its comparative financial statements for the prior period as if ASC 606 had been in effect for that period.\nThe most significant changes to revenue recognition under ASC 606 relate to the timing of revenue recognized for arrangements that include licensing of our technologies. Under ASC 606 revenue related to licensing of access to our technologies is recognized at inception of the agreement, generally the effective date of the agreement. For existing licensing arrangements, the effect of ASC 606 is to shift revenue to earlier periods. Approximately $11.3 million of licensing revenue that was being recognized over the five-year period 2016-2021 is being recognized in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe other significant change under ASC 606 relates to the timing of collaboration revenue when the Company completes its performance obligations for delivery of a drug candidate to its collaboration partners after applying its technologies. For existing collaborations, the effect of ASC 606 is to accelerate revenue recognition to earlier periods. Approximately $6.25 million of collaboration revenue recognized in 2017 and 2018 under historical accounting guidance is being recognized in 2016 under ASC 606. An additional $20.5 million of collaboration revenue that would be recognized in 2018 is being recognized in 2017.\nCapitalized Intellectual Property Costs\nWe capitalize and amortize third-party intellectual property costs such as amounts paid to outside patent counsel for filing, prosecuting and obtaining patents for our internally developed technologies and product candidates, to the extent such patents are deemed to have probable future economic benefit. We also capitalize amounts paid to third parties for licenses that we acquire for intellectual property or for research and development purposes. The net capitalized patents, licenses and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $12.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively. We believe that these costs should be capitalized as the intellectual property portfolio is the underlying property right to our technologies and product candidates and supports the upfront payments, licensing fees, and milestone payments made by our collaboration partners for licensing our technologies and product candidates.\nWe begin amortization of capitalized patent costs during the period that we obtain a patent relating to the capitalized cost over the shorter of the patent life or the estimated economic useful life. Capitalized licensing costs are amortized beginning in the period that access to the license or technology is available and is amortized over the shorter of the license term or the estimated economic useful life of the licensed asset. Such amortization is reflected in the General and Administrative section of our Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nOn a regular basis we review the capitalized intellectual property portfolio and determine if there have been changes in the scientific or patent landscape that leads us to decide to abandon an in-process patent application or abandon a previously issued patent. While we confer with outside patent counsel, the decision to continue prosecuting certain patent claims or abandon other claims are made by us based on our judgment and existing knowledge of our technology, current U.S. and foreign patent authority rulings and expected rulings, and scientific advances and patent filings by competitors operating in our technology or drug development field. We record an expense for the write-off of capitalized intangible assets in the period that the decision to abandon a claim or license is made. We also review the carrying value of capitalized licensing costs on a regular basis to determine if there have been any changes to the useful life or estimated amortization period over which the costs should be amortized. We recorded a charge for abandoned intangible assets of $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Such charges are reflected in the General and Administrative section of our Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWe determine if there has been an impairment of our intangible assets which include the capitalized patent and licensing costs whenever events such as recurring operating losses or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontract research organizations and other service providers in connection with clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontract manufacturers in connection with the production of and testing of clinical trial materials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvendors in connection with preclinical development activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing these costs, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed for which we have not been invoiced and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more-likely-than not threshold of that position being sustained. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company has concluded that there are no material uncertain tax positions and has not recorded an income tax expense or liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) was enacted into law, which beginning in 2018, made several changes to U.S. corporate income tax provisions. We have identified changes in the TCJA which will have a material effect on our tax provision and future tax obligations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate rate from a maximum rate of 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effect of this change was to reduce the potential future tax benefits from our deferred tax assets by $19.6 million that we had as of December 31, 2017. We have deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2017 from deferred revenue and net operating loss carryforwards and the reduction in the U.S. rate reduced the future value of these assets. The TCJA also changed the potential benefit of net operating losses incurred after January 1, 2018. The new law eliminated the ability to carryback net operating losses to prior years and also limited the amount of net operating losses incurred post January 1, 2018 that could be used to offset taxable income to 80% of the taxable income generated in any one year.\nThe other material change in our tax provision from the TCJA is elimination of the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) system and allowance for a tax refund for AMT credit carryovers as of December 31, 2017. We recorded an income tax receivable related to AMT credit carryovers of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe recorded net deferred tax assets of $82.5 million as of December 31, 2018, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. The deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of deferred revenue, federal and state tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $191.2 million; $102.6 million of such losses were incurred prior to December 31, 2017 and $88.6 million were incurred in the year December 31, 2018. We also had available tax credit carryforwards of $14.9 million for federal tax purposes. We had cumulative state tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018 of $138.9 million, and available state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $8.2 million, which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any.\nOur federal net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to January 1, 2018, expire starting in 2026, state net operating losses expire starting in 2031, and federal tax credit carryforwards expire starting in 2019. Upon analysis, we believe that our net operating losses and tax credits were subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 under Section 382 and similar state provisions. As a result of the limitations under Section 382, our federal and state tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have been limited.\nNo income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded a net benefit of $0.5 million, related to federal and state AMTs, for the year ended December 31, 2017, and we recorded a tax expense of $1.0 million, related to federal and state AMTs for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nWe record the fair value of stock options and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to employees as of the grant date as compensation expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. For non-employees, we also record the fair value of stock options as of the grant date as compensation expense over the service period. We then periodically re-measure the awards to reflect the current fair value at each reporting period until the non-employee completes the performance obligation or the date on which a performance commitment is reached. Expense is recognized over the related service period.\nWe calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.\nCommon Stock Options Fair Value\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The use of a Black-Scholes model requires us to apply judgment and make assumptions and estimates that include the following:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected Volatility-Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. As we do not yet have sufficient history of our own volatility, we have identified several public entities of similar size, complexity and stage of development and calculate the historical volatility using the volatility of these companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected Dividend Yield-We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of each option grant during the year, having a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected Term-This is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised.

</tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased by $19.9 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts as we continue to expand our pipeline of bispecific candidates. The primary increases in research and development spending were on our bispecific TME checkpoint and CD-3 programs. Increased spending on our XmAb5871 program and early discovery research programs was partially offset by reduced spending on our XmAb7195 program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4.4 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts primarily due to an increase in facility costs, staffing and stock-based compensation costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net increased by $2.1 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts, reflecting additional interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our operations have been primarily financed through proceeds from our public offering, private sales of our equity, convertible notes and payments received under our collaboration and development partnerships and licensing arrangements. We have devoted our resources to funding research and development programs, including discovery research, preclinical and clinical development activities.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses into the foreseeable future as we advance the ongoing development of our bispecific Fc domain pipeline of product candidates, XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, and XmAb24306, evaluate opportunities for the potential clinical development of our other preclinical programs, and continue our research efforts.\nIn March 2018, we finalized the sale of 8,395,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $31.00 per share in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.5 million, after deducting underwriters' commissions and offering expenses.\nIn July 2016 we received a $150.0 million upfront payment in connection with our collaboration with Novartis. On December 6, 2016, we finalized the sale of 5,272,750 shares of common stock at an offering price of $24.00 per share in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $119.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nOn September 19, 2016, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with Piper Jaffray & Co (Piper Jaffray) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $40 million of common stock through Piper Jaffray as sales agent. The issuance and sale of these shares by Xencor under the Distribution Agreement will be pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No.333-213700) declared effective by the SEC on October 5, 2016.\nTo date, we have not sold any shares under the Distribution Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $530.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $363.3 million at December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to receive additional payments from our collaborators for research and development services rendered, additional milestone, contingent payments, opt-in and annual license maintenance payments. We expect to close the Genentech transaction in the first quarter of 2019, for which we will receive a $120 million non-refundable upfront payment 30 days after the effective date. Our ability to receive milestone payments and contingent payments from our partners is dependent upon either our ability or our partners' abilities to achieve certain levels of research and development activities and is therefore uncertain at this time.\nFunding Requirements\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. As we are currently in the early clinical stages of development, it will be some time before we expect to achieve this and it is uncertain that we ever will. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase in connection with ongoing as well as additional planned clinical and preclinical development of product candidates in our pipeline. We expect to continue our collaboration arrangements and will look for additional collaboration and licensing opportunities.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict our funding requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain potential milestone payments will fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(79,756)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,597)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(164,767)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(214,274)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n254,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n120,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reflects operating expenses primarily for advancing our bispecific candidates and clinical trials for XmAb5871 during the year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects the upfront payment of $150.0 million received under our Novartis collaboration and a milestone payment from Alexion in excess of operating expenses during the year.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities consist primarily of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities offset by purchases of marketable securities available-for-sale, acquisition of intangible assets and purchases of property and equipment. In 2018, we purchased $155.7 million in marketable securities, net of $222.1 million of proceeds from sale and maturities. In 2017 we received $39.2 million in marketable securities, net of $76.5 million of purchases. In 2016, we invested $210.6 million in marketable securities net of $105.5 million of sales and maturities. We acquired $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million of intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We purchased $7.2 million, $5.3 million and $1.5 million of capital equipment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The increase in capital expenditure in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to additional purchase of research and development equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consists primarily of net proceeds from the follow-on equity offering and cash from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the ESPP.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 consists primarily of cash from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the ESPP.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consists primarily of net proceeds from the follow-on equity offering and cash from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the ESPP.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligation relating to facilities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsists of operating leases on our corporate headquarters in Monrovia and on our San Diego offices encompassing 48,000 square feet and 24,000 square feet that expire in September 2022 and August 2022 respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are obligated to make future payments to third parties under in-license agreements, including sublicense fees, royalties, and payments that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones. We have also entered into agreements with third party vendors which will require us to make future payments upon the delivery of goods and services in future periods.\nIn February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with BIO-TECHNE Corporation for a non-exclusive license to certain antibody technology including monoclonal antibodies which recognize human somatostatin reception 2.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody and other protein therapeutics to treat severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. We are developing a suite of clinical-stage drug candidates from our proprietary XmAb\u00ae technology platforms that are designed to treat cancer, autoimmune and allergic diseases, and other conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches to antibody design, which focus on the portion of antibodies that interact with target antigens, our protein engineering efforts and the XmAb technologies are focused on the portion of the antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. This portion, referred to as the Fc domain, is constant and interchangeable among antibodies. Our engineered Fc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains.\nWe believe our Fc domains enhance antibody performance by, for example, increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half-life, or stabilizing novel antibody and other protein structures, while maintaining 99.5% identity in structure and sequence to natural antibodies. The most recent expansion of our platform is the XmAb bispecific Fc domains, which enable the rapid design and simplified development of antibodies, and other protein structures, that bind two or more different targets simultaneously. By designing antibodies and other protein molecules with improved function, we believe that our XmAb-engineered proteins offer innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantages over other treatments.\nOur business strategy is based on the plug-and-play nature of the XmAb technology, allowing us to create new antibody drug candidates for our internal development or licensing, or to selectively license access to one or more of our XmAb technologies to pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to use in developing their own proprietary antibodies with improved properties. Our protein engineering capabilities and the modular nature of our technology allows us to quickly identify and create multiple drug candidates for potential development. We have applied our XmAb technology to:\n 1. develop a pipeline of drug candidates from our bispecific Fc domains that we are developing on our own and with our partners, \n 2. develop XmAb antibody candidates from our other Fc technologies through early stage of development and then license them to partners for continued development, and \n 3. apply our Fc technologies to partner created antibodies. These transactions generally require very little effort on our part. \nOur many partnerships and licensing transactions provide us with multiple revenue streams that help fund development of our product candidates and usually require limited resources or efforts from us. In 2018, we received $20.5 million in milestones from our partners and in February 2019, we announced a collaboration with Genentech for which we will receive an upfront payment of $120 million. There are currently 12 antibody product candidates in clinical trials that have been engineered with XmAb technology, two additional candidates have IND applications allowed by the FDA and will begin Phase 1 trials in 2019, and two more programs are in the preclinical stage of development.\nIn December 2018, the FDA approved the first antibody that incorporates our Fc technology. ALXN1210, now Ultomiris\u2122, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial marketing. Ultomiris is a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), that is being developed by our partner Alexion, and incorporates our Xtend\u00ae Fc technology which allows for longer duration of action and less frequent dosing regimens compared to the previously approved therapy, Soliris\u00ae. There are five additional clinical candidates being advanced by licensees and development partners.\nWe have created a suite of compounds developed from our XmAb bispecific Fc domains that we wholly-own or are developing with our partners. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates.\nThe initial bispecific candidates that we designed were created with our engineered heterodimer Fc domain, or bispecific Fc domain, and are dual-antigen targeting molecules, containing an anti-tumor associated antigen binding domain and a second binding domain targeted to CD3, an activating receptor on T-cells. We are advancing three CD3 bispecific candidates through clinical development: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, and XmAb18087.\n \u00b7 XmAb14045 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD123, an antigen on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and leukemic stem cells, and CD3, a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain. \nIt is being developed in collaboration with our partner Novartis and is being evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We presented initial data from the study in December 2018 at ASH. The data presented indicated multiple complete responses had been achieved with weekly dosing of XmAb14045 in this heavily-pretreated patient population. 28% of evaluable AML patients achieved either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete homological recovery (CRi) at the two highest dose levels studies to date.\nIn February 2019, we received notice from the FDA placing the XmAb14045 study on partial clinical hold due to safety issues of cytokine release syndrome and pulmonary toxicities. Under the partial hold, existing subjects on the trial may continue to receive dosing; however, no new subjects may be enrolled pending FDA review of a clinical hold response.\nThe partial hold was initiated following recent safety reports Xencor submitted to the FDA on two patient deaths that were considered at least possibly related to XmAb14045. One patient experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after their first dose, the treatment of which was complicated by the patient's decision to withdraw care. One subject developed acute pulmonary edema following several doses of XmAb14045. Items to be addressed in the response include analysis of CRS cases per dosing level, efficacy information, and strategies to mitigate the observed toxicities.\nWe are coordinating a response to the partial hold by the FDA with our partner, Novartis, and plan to continue development of XmAb14045 pending resolution of the partial hold.\n \u00b7 XmAb13676 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. In February 2017, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb13676 in patients with B-cell malignancies. This program was also partnered with Novartis as part of our Novartis collaboration. In December 2018, as part of a strategic realignment of their pipeline, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights to XmAb13676, which is effective June 21, 2019. Under the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will be responsible for funding its share of the development costs for the program through June 2020. We plan to continue develop XmAb13676 as planned and expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 study in the second half of 2019. \n \u00b7 XmAb18087 is a bispecific that targets somatostatin receptor 2, or SSTR2, and the cytotoxic T-cell binding domain CD3 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In February 2018, we dosed our first patient in a Phase 1 study. XmAb18087 is our first CD3 bispecific to be evaluated in solid tumors. We expect to provide initial data from this study in the second half of 2019. \nWe are also advancing into clinical development a suite of tumor microenvironment activators that have been designed to promote tumor-selective T-cell activation by targeting multiple checkpoint or co-stimulatory receptors. We are advancing three TME activator candidates through clinical development: XmAb20717, XmAb22841, and XmAb23104:\n \u00b7 XmAb20717 simultaneously targets PD-1 and CTLA-4 and is being developed in broad oncology indications including solid tumors. In July 2018, we dosed the first patient in an open label Phase 1 dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb20717 in patients with selected solid tumors. We expect to provide initial data from this study in the second half of 2019. \n \u00b7 XmAb23104 targets PD-1 and ICOS, an immune co-stimulatory receptor, and is being developed for multiple oncology indications. In October 2018, the FDA approved our IND application for the study of XmAb23104. We have planned an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb23104 in patients with selected solid tumors, and we plan to dose the first patient in the first half of 2019. \n \u00b7 XmAb22841 targets CTLA-4 and LAG-3, also an immune checkpoint receptor, and is being developed for multiple indications. We intend to advance XmAb22841 in combination with an anti-PD-1 drug to create a triple checkpoint blockade. In November 2018, the FDA approved our IND application for the study of XmAb22841. We have planned an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb22841 in patients with selected solid tumors, and we plan to dose the first patient in the first half of 2019. \nIn 2018, we expanded our bispecific Fc platform with the design of our novel cytokine candidates. These cytokines are built on our bispecific Fc domain and have potency tuned to improve therapeutic index. These candidates also incorporate our Xtend technology for longer duration of action. Our first cytokine candidate is XmAb24306, an IL15/IL15-receptior alpha complex fused to a bispecific domain (IL15/IL15Ra-Fc). We believe that IL-15 cytokines, like XmAb24306, will be an optimal candidate for oncology combination therapies.\n \u00b7 XmAb24306 is currently in IND-enabling studies, and we will support Genentech's efforts to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019. We believe a broad combination development strategy will be critical to realize the potential of IL-15 cytokines. In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, whereby the companies will co-develop XmAb24306 and other potential IL-15 programs. \nWe have also created a suite of wholly-owned compounds using our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain.\n \u00b7 XmAb5871 uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and targets CD19 with its variable domain, which is designed to inhibit the function of B cells, an important component of the immune system. We have completed Phase 2 clinical trials for XmAb5871 in three autoimmune diseases: SLE, IgG4-RD, and RA. \nIn October 2018, we presented topline data from the Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with no loss of improvement (LOI) (i.e. maintenance of improvement) in the efficacy-evaluable population. Improvement was maintained at Day 225 by 42% of patients in the XmAb5871-treated arm, compared to 28.6% of patients in the placebo-treated arm, which did not meet the primary endpoint for statistical significance.\nThe SLE study did meet secondary endpoints included evaluations of time to LOI. Patients in the efficacy-evaluable population treated with XmAb5871 experienced a statistically significant longer time to LOI, compared to placebo-treated patients, which represented a 76% improvement in median time to LOI and a 47% reduction in risk of LOI. XmAb5871 was well tolerated, and its safety profile was consistent with previous trials.\nIn November 2017 we presented final data from the IgG4-RD Phase 2 trial at the ACR annual meeting.\nWe have also completed an additional Phase 1 trial for a subcutaneous formulation of XmAb5871.\nWe believe that the data from the studies of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE and IgG4-RD support further development in these indications and show the potential of XmAb5871 in other B-cell mediated autoimmune indications. We are seeking to partner XmAb5871 with a partner that has the infrastructure and resources to continue late-stage development of XmAb5871 and maximize the potential of this candidate for a broad set of patient populations.\n \u00b7 XmAb7195 uses our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and is being developed for the treatment of severe asthma and allergic diseases. In May 2016, we reported complete data from the Phase 1a trial with XmAb7195 treating subjects with high baseline IgE levels. In 2017 we announced data from a Phase 1b trial for XmAb7195 with a subcutaneous formulation. The data from the trial showed that subcutaneous administration of XmAb7195 was well tolerated and effective at reducing free and total IgE levels in subjects in the study. The results support subcutaneous delivery for future development. We are seeking a development partner for XmAb7195. \nWe have also created antibodies which we have licensed to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for further development. These include MOR208, an antibody in Phase 3 development, which we licensed to MorphoSys, and a CD38 x CD3 bispecific antibody candidate which included XmAb13551 and antibody components used to assemble AMG424, which we licensed to Amgen. In 2017 MorphoSys advanced MOR208 into a Phase 3 clinical trial and MorphoSys has indicated plans to file a BLA in the U.S. in 2019. Amgen has started a Phase 1 study for AMG424 and also has a preclinical candidate, AMG509, that was created with our bispecific Fc domain, advancing into development. There are currently five other programs where we have licensed our technology to partners for use in development programs with their own molecules, and four of these programs are in clinical development. The most advanced is Ultomiris, formerly ALXN1210. In 2018, Alexion submitted marketing authorization applications for Ultomiris to the regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and in December 2018, Alexion received FDA approval.\nWe have over 750 issued and pending patents worldwide to protect our XmAb technology platform and XmAb drug candidates.\nKey Company Milestones\nGenentech Collaboration: In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech (Genentech Agreement) to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics that use our bispecific Fc technology, including XmAb24306, in the areas of cancer immunotherapy. We will jointly collaborate on the worldwide development of XmAb24306 and other IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, each a Collaboration Product\u201d with Genentech maintaining worldwide commercialization rights, subject to us having a co-promotion option in the U.S. We retained the right to perform clinical studies of Collaboration Products in combination with other therapeutic agents, subject to certain requirements. Genentech received a worldwide exclusive license to the XmAb24306 and other Collaboration Products.\nUnder the Genentech Agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $120 million and are eligible to receive up to $160 million in clinical milestone payments for each Collaboration Product that advances to Phase 3 clinical trials. We are eligible to receive a 45% share of net profits from sales of XmAb24306 and other Collaboratio Products, while also sharing in the net losses at the same percentage rate and we will jointly share in 45% of development and commercialization costs. We will conduct a two-year joint research program with Genentech to discover additional programs around the IL-15 cytokine technology and will receive a $20 million milestone payment upon the initiation of each Phase 1 clinical trial for each new Collaboration Product developed under a research plan.\nThe Genentech Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and closing is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019.\nNovartis Collaboration. In June 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis (Novartis Agreement) to develop and commercialize bispecific and other Fc engineered antibody drug candidates using the Company's proprietary XmAb technologies and drug candidates. Under the Novartis Agreement, we licensed certain rights to our two lead bispecific candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, to Novartis including the right for Novartis to commercialize drug products from both programs in all worldwide territories outside the U.S. We are co-developing XmAb14045 worldwide and sharing development costs equally. We will also apply our bispecific technology to up to four Novartis identified antibodies and will also license other Fc technologies to Novartis. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $150 million and are eligible to receive up to $2.1 billion in milestone payments under the Novartis Agreement.\nIn December 2018, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights with respect to the XmAb13676 program. Novartis will continue to fund its share of development costs for the XmAb13676 program through June 2020 and we plan to continue development of the program.\nLicensing Partnerships. In addition to Novartis and Genentech collaborations, we have four other licensing partnerships for the licensing of our XmAb technology. These arrangements provide research funding, upfront payments and annual licensing fees in addition to potential milestones and contractual payments as our partners advance compounds that incorporate our technology through clinical development.\nDuring 2018, Alexion submitted regulatory filings for Ultomiris in the U.S., European Union and Japan. In December 2018, Alexion received approval from the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with PNH. We received a total of $20 million in regulatory milestone payments from Alexion for Ultomiris in 2018. In November 2018, Amgen began preclinical studies for AMG509, for intended clinical development for patients with prostate cancer, and we received a $0.5 million milestone payment.\nBispecific Fc programs. We continue to advance our pipeline with bispecific Fc antibodies and cytokines that incorporate our XmAb bispecific Fc domain, which allow us to create molecules that bind to multiple different targets. By using an Fc as an integral part of the molecule, we impart the advantages of natural antibody features, including enabling it to retain or enhance favorable half-life, simplifying manufacturing processes and modulating potency to reduce toxicity.\nWe have initiated the Phase 1 trials for four bispecific oncology candidates: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, and XmAb20717. We have received FDA approval of our IND applications for our next two candidates, XmAb22841 and XmAb23104, and we will be initiating Phase 1 trials in the first half of 2019. We are in preclinical development for our first bispecific Fc domain cytokine candidate, XmAb24306, and we plan to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019.\nIn March 2018, we completed the sale of 8,395,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten follow-on financing and raised net proceeds of $245.5 million after deducting underwriters' commissions and expense of the sale.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues\nOur revenues to date have been generated primarily from our collaboration agreements and our technology licensing agreements. Revenue recognized from our collaboration agreements includes non-refundable upfront payments and milestone payments while revenue from our technology licensing agreements includes upfront payments, annual maintenance fees, option payments to obtain commercial licenses and milestone payments. Since our inception through December 31, 2018, we have generated $266.2 million in revenues under the various product development partnership and technology license arrangements. Several of our product development partnership and technology license agreements provide us the opportunity to earn future milestone payments, royalties on product sales and option exercise payments.\nSummary of Collaboration and Licensing Revenue by Partner\nThe following is a comparison of collaboration and licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmgen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAlexion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCSL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMorphoSys\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovo Nordisk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovartis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related personnel costs, supplies, facility costs and preclinical testing costs, clinical trial costs and fees paid to external service providers. External service providers include contract research organizations (CRO) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) to conduct clinical trials, manufacturing and process development, IND-enabling toxicology testing and formulation of clinical drug supplies. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expense when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. We estimate contract manufacturing, preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to the contracts with manufacturing, research institutions and clinical research organizations that manufacture and conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf based on the actual time and expenses incurred by them. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the related agreement. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and adjust estimates accordingly. Our estimates of clinical trial expense have fluctuated on a period-to-period basis due to changes in the stage of the clinical trials and patient enrollment levels. We expect to experience a continuing pattern of fluctuations in clinical trial expenses as current clinical trials are completed and as we initiate additional and later stage clinical trials. To date, we have not experienced significant differences between our periodic estimates of clinical trial expense and the actual costs incurred. We expect changes in future clinical trial expenses to be driven by changes in service provider costs and changes in clinical stage and patient enrollment. We have incurred a total of $466.1 million in research and development expenses from inception through December 31, 2018.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses may increase over spending levels in recent years if we are successful in advancing XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, XmAb24306, or any of our other preclinical programs into advanced stages of clinical development. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Numerous factors may affect the probability of success for each product candidate, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability, approval by regulatory authorities and commercial viability.\nOur research and development operations are conducted such that design, management and evaluation of results of all of our research and development is performed internally, while the execution of certain phases of our research and development programs, such as toxicology studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and manufacturing in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), is accomplished using CROs and CMOs. We account for research and development costs on a program-by-program basis except in the early stages of research and discovery, when costs are often devoted to identifying preclinical candidates and improving our discovery platform and technologies, which are not necessarily allocable to a specific development program. We assign costs for such activities to distinct projects for preclinical pipeline development and new technologies. We allocate research management, overhead, commonly used laboratory supplies and equipment, and facility costs based on the number of full-time research personnel allocated to each program.\nThe following is a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nXmAb5871 programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nXmAb7195 program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBispecific programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCD-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTME checkpoints\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCytokines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubtotal Bispecific programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther, research and early stage programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n97.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n51.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation related to our executive, finance, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include rent and utilities, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services.\nOther Income, Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our investments during the years.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Our management believes judgment is involved in determining revenue recognition, the fair value-based measurement of stock-based compensation, the fair value estimate of marketable securities, the capitalization and recoverability of intellectual property costs, valuation of deferred tax assets and accruals. Our management evaluates estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences could be material to the financial statements. If our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have, to date, earned revenue from research and development collaborations, which may include research and development services, licenses of our internally-developed technologies, licenses of our internally-developed drug candidates, or combinations of these.\nThe terms of our license and research and development and collaboration agreements generally include non-refundable upfront payments, research funding, co-development reimbursements, license fees and, milestone and other contingent payments to us for the achievement of defined collaboration objectives and certain clinical, regulatory and sales-based events, as well as royalties on sales of any commercialized products.\nThe terms of our licensing agreements include non-refundable upfront fees, annual licensing fees, and contractual payment obligations for the achievement of pre-defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based events by our partners. The licensing agreements also include royalties on sales of any commercialized products by our partners.\nAs described in Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606. Subsequent to the adoption, the Company recognizes revenue through the five-step process in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue Recognition when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company used the full retrospective method and as a result the Company has revised its comparative financial statements for the prior period as if ASC 606 had been in effect for that period.\nThe most significant changes to revenue recognition under ASC 606 relate to the timing of revenue recognized for arrangements that include licensing of our technologies. Under ASC 606 revenue related to licensing of access to our technologies is recognized at inception of the agreement, generally the effective date of the agreement. For existing licensing arrangements, the effect of ASC 606 is to shift revenue to earlier periods. Approximately $11.3 million of licensing revenue that was being recognized over the five-year period 2016-2021 is being recognized in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe other significant change under ASC 606 relates to the timing of collaboration revenue when the Company completes its performance obligations for delivery of a drug candidate to its collaboration partners after applying its technologies. For existing collaborations, the effect of ASC 606 is to accelerate revenue recognition to earlier periods. Approximately $6.25 million of collaboration revenue recognized in 2017 and 2018 under historical accounting guidance is being recognized in 2016 under ASC 606. An additional $20.5 million of collaboration revenue that would be recognized in 2018 is being recognized in 2017.\nCapitalized Intellectual Property Costs\nWe capitalize and amortize third-party intellectual property costs such as amounts paid to outside patent counsel for filing, prosecuting and obtaining patents for our internally developed technologies and product candidates, to the extent such patents are deemed to have probable future economic benefit. We also capitalize amounts paid to third parties for licenses that we acquire for intellectual property or for research and development purposes. The net capitalized patents, licenses and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $12.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively. We believe that these costs should be capitalized as the intellectual property portfolio is the underlying property right to our technologies and product candidates and supports the upfront payments, licensing fees, and milestone payments made by our collaboration partners for licensing our technologies and product candidates.\nWe begin amortization of capitalized patent costs during the period that we obtain a patent relating to the capitalized cost over the shorter of the patent life or the estimated economic useful life. Capitalized licensing costs are amortized beginning in the period that access to the license or technology is available and is amortized over the shorter of the license term or the estimated economic useful life of the licensed asset. Such amortization is reflected in the General and Administrative section of our Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nOn a regular basis we review the capitalized intellectual property portfolio and determine if there have been changes in the scientific or patent landscape that leads us to decide to abandon an in-process patent application or abandon a previously issued patent. While we confer with outside patent counsel, the decision to continue prosecuting certain patent claims or abandon other claims are made by us based on our judgment and existing knowledge of our technology, current U.S. and foreign patent authority rulings and expected rulings, and scientific advances and patent filings by competitors operating in our technology or drug development field. We record an expense for the write-off of capitalized intangible assets in the period that the decision to abandon a claim or license is made. We also review the carrying value of capitalized licensing costs on a regular basis to determine if there have been any changes to the useful life or estimated amortization period over which the costs should be amortized. We recorded a charge for abandoned intangible assets of $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Such charges are reflected in the General and Administrative section of our Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWe determine if there has been an impairment of our intangible assets which include the capitalized patent and licensing costs whenever events such as recurring operating losses or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\n \u00b7 contract research organizations and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of and testing of clinical trial materials; and \n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities. \nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing these costs, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed for which we have not been invoiced and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more-likely-than not threshold of that position being sustained. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company has concluded that there are no material uncertain tax positions and has not recorded an income tax expense or liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) was enacted into law, which beginning in 2018, made several changes to U.S. corporate income tax provisions. We have identified changes in the TCJA which will have a material effect on our tax provision and future tax obligations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate rate from a maximum rate of 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effect of this change was to reduce the potential future tax benefits from our deferred tax assets by $19.6 million that we had as of December 31, 2017. We have deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2017 from deferred revenue and net operating loss carryforwards and the reduction in the U.S. rate reduced the future value of these assets. The TCJA also changed the potential benefit of net operating losses incurred after January 1, 2018. The new law eliminated the ability to carryback net operating losses to prior years and also limited the amount of net operating losses incurred post January 1, 2018 that could be used to offset taxable income to 80% of the taxable income generated in any one year.\nThe other material change in our tax provision from the TCJA is elimination of the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) system and allowance for a tax refund for AMT credit carryovers as of December 31, 2017. We recorded an income tax receivable related to AMT credit carryovers of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe recorded net deferred tax assets of $82.5 million as of December 31, 2018, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. The deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of deferred revenue, federal and state tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $191.2 million; $102.6 million of such losses were incurred prior to December 31, 2017 and $88.6 million were incurred in the year December 31, 2018. We also had available tax credit carryforwards of $14.9 million for federal tax purposes. We had cumulative state tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018 of $138.9 million, and available state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $8.2 million, which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any.\nOur federal net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to January 1, 2018, expire starting in 2026, state net operating losses expire starting in 2031, and federal tax credit carryforwards expire starting in 2019. Upon analysis, we believe that our net operating losses and tax credits were subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 under Section 382 and similar state provisions. As a result of the limitations under Section 382, our federal and state tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have been limited.\nNo income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded a net benefit of $0.5 million, related to federal and state AMTs, for the year ended December 31, 2017, and we recorded a tax expense of $1.0 million, related to federal and state AMTs for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nWe record the fair value of stock options and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to employees as of the grant date as compensation expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. For non-employees, we also record the fair value of stock options as of the grant date as compensation expense over the service period. We then periodically re-measure the awards to reflect the current fair value at each reporting period until the non-employee completes the performance obligation or the date on which a performance commitment is reached. Expense is recognized over the related service period.\nWe calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.\nCommon Stock Options Fair Value\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The use of a Black-Scholes model requires us to apply judgment and make assumptions and estimates that include the following:\n \u00b7 Expected Volatility-Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. As we do not yet have sufficient history of our own volatility, we have identified several public entities of similar size, complexity and stage of development and calculate the historical volatility using the volatility of these companies. \n \u00b7 Expected Dividend Yield-We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. \n \u00b7 Risk-Free Interest Rate-This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of each option grant during the year, having a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option. \n \u00b7 Expected Term-This is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised. Options granted have a maximum term of ten years and we have estimated the expected life of the option term to be between five and six years. We use a simplified method to calculate the average expected term for employee awards. \nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes

The primary increases in research and development spending were on our bispecific TME checkpoint and CD-3 programs. Increased spending on our XmAb5871 program and early discovery research programs was partially offset by reduced spending on our XmAb7195 program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4.4 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts primarily due to an increase in facility costs, staffing and stock-based compensation costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net increased by $2.1 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts, reflecting additional interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our operations have been primarily financed through proceeds from our public offering, private sales of our equity, convertible notes and payments received under our collaboration and development partnerships and licensing arrangements. We have devoted our resources to funding research and development programs, including discovery research, preclinical and clinical development activities.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses into the foreseeable future as we advance the ongoing development of our bispecific Fc domain pipeline of product candidates, XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, and XmAb24306, evaluate opportunities for the potential clinical development of our other preclinical programs, and continue our research efforts.\nIn March 2018, we finalized the sale of 8,395,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $31.00 per share in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.5 million, after deducting underwriters' commissions and offering expenses.\nIn July 2016 we received a $150.0 million upfront payment in connection with our collaboration with Novartis. On December 6, 2016, we finalized the sale of 5,272,750 shares of common stock at an offering price of $24.00 per share in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $119.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nOn September 19, 2016, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with Piper Jaffray & Co (Piper Jaffray) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $40 million of common stock through Piper Jaffray as sales agent. The issuance and sale of these shares by Xencor under the Distribution Agreement will be pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No.333-213700) declared effective by the SEC on October 5, 2016.\nTo date, we have not sold any shares under the Distribution Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $530.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $363.3 million at December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to receive additional payments from our collaborators for research and development services rendered, additional milestone, contingent payments, opt-in and annual license maintenance payments. We expect to close the Genentech transaction in the first quarter of 2019, for which we will receive a $120 million non-refundable upfront payment 30 days after the effective date. Our ability to receive milestone payments and contingent payments from our partners is dependent upon either our ability or our partners' abilities to achieve certain levels of research and development activities and is therefore uncertain at this time.\nFunding Requirements\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. As we are currently in the early clinical stages of development, it will be some time before we expect to achieve this and it is uncertain that we ever will. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase in connection with ongoing as well as additional planned clinical and preclinical development of product candidates in our pipeline. We expect to continue our collaboration arrangements and will look for additional collaboration and licensing opportunities.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict our funding requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain potential milestone payments will fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(As Revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(79,756)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,597)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(164,767)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(214,274)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n254,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n120,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reflects operating expenses primarily for advancing our bispecific candidates and clinical trials for XmAb5871 during the year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects the upfront payment of $150.0 million received under our Novartis collaboration and a milestone payment from Alexion in excess of operating expenses during the year.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities consist primarily of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities offset by purchases of marketable securities available-for-sale, acquisition of intangible assets and purchases of property and equipment. In 2018, we purchased $155.7 million in marketable securities, net of $222.1 million of proceeds from sale and maturities. In 2017 we received $39.2 million in marketable securities, net of $76.5 million of purchases. In 2016, we invested $210.6 million in marketable securities net of $105.5 million of sales and maturities.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody and other protein therapeutics to treat severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. We are developing a suite of clinical-stage drug candidates from our proprietary XmAb\u00ae technology platforms that are designed to treat cancer, autoimmune and allergic diseases, and other conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches to antibody design, which focus on the portion of antibodies that interact with target antigens, our protein engineering efforts and the XmAb technologies are focused on the portion of the antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. This portion, referred to as the Fc domain, is constant and interchangeable among antibodies. Our engineered Fc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains.\nWe believe our Fc domains enhance antibody performance by, for example, increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half-life, or stabilizing novel antibody and other protein structures, while maintaining 99.5% identity in structure and sequence to natural antibodies. The most recent expansion of our platform is the XmAb bispecific Fc domains, which enable the rapid design and simplified development of antibodies, and other protein structures, that bind two or more different targets simultaneously. By designing antibodies and other protein molecules with improved function, we believe that our XmAb-engineered proteins offer innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantages over other treatments.\nOur business strategy is based on the plug-and-play nature of the XmAb technology, allowing us to create new antibody drug candidates for our internal development or licensing, or to selectively license access to one or more of our XmAb technologies to pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to use in developing their own proprietary antibodies with improved properties. Our protein engineering capabilities and the modular nature of our technology allows us to quickly identify and create multiple drug candidates for potential development. We have applied our XmAb technology to:\n 1. develop a pipeline of drug candidates from our bispecific Fc domains that we are developing on our own and with our partners, \n 2. develop XmAb antibody candidates from our other Fc technologies through early stage of development and then license them to partners for continued development, and \n 3. apply our Fc technologies to partner created antibodies. These transactions generally require very little effort on our part. \nOur many partnerships and licensing transactions provide us with multiple revenue streams that help fund development of our product candidates and usually require limited resources or efforts from us. In 2018, we received $20.5 million in milestones from our partners and in February 2019, we announced a collaboration with Genentech for which we will receive an upfront payment of $120 million. There are currently 12 antibody product candidates in clinical trials that have been engineered with XmAb technology, two additional candidates have IND applications allowed by the FDA and will begin Phase 1 trials in 2019, and two more programs are in the preclinical stage of development.\nIn December 2018, the FDA approved the first antibody that incorporates our Fc technology. ALXN1210, now Ultomiris\u2122, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial marketing. Ultomiris is a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), that is being developed by our partner Alexion, and incorporates our Xtend\u00ae Fc technology which allows for longer duration of action and less frequent dosing regimens compared to the previously approved therapy, Soliris\u00ae. There are five additional clinical candidates being advanced by licensees and development partners.\nWe have created a suite of compounds developed from our XmAb bispecific Fc domains that we wholly-own or are developing with our partners. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates.\nThe initial bispecific candidates that we designed were created with our engineered heterodimer Fc domain, or bispecific Fc domain, and are dual-antigen targeting molecules, containing an anti-tumor associated antigen binding domain and a second binding domain targeted to CD3, an activating receptor on T-cells. We are advancing three CD3 bispecific candidates through clinical development: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, and XmAb18087.\n \u00b7 XmAb14045 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD123, an antigen on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and leukemic stem cells, and CD3, a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain. \nIt is being developed in collaboration with our partner Novartis and is being evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We presented initial data from the study in December 2018 at ASH. The data presented indicated multiple complete responses had been achieved with weekly dosing of XmAb14045 in this heavily-pretreated patient population. 28% of evaluable AML patients achieved either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete homological recovery (CRi) at the two highest dose levels studies to date.\nIn February 2019, we received notice from the FDA placing the XmAb14045 study on partial clinical hold due to safety issues of cytokine release syndrome and pulmonary toxicities. Under the partial hold, existing subjects on the trial may continue to receive dosing; however, no new subjects may be enrolled pending FDA review of a clinical hold response.\nThe partial hold was initiated following recent safety reports Xencor submitted to the FDA on two patient deaths that were considered at least possibly related to XmAb14045. One patient experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after their first dose, the treatment of which was complicated by the patient's decision to withdraw care. One subject developed acute pulmonary edema following several doses of XmAb14045. Items to be addressed in the response include analysis of CRS cases per dosing level, efficacy information, and strategies to mitigate the observed toxicities.\nWe are coordinating a response to the partial hold by the FDA with our partner, Novartis, and plan to continue development of XmAb14045 pending resolution of the partial hold.\n \u00b7 XmAb13676 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. In February 2017, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb13676 in patients with B-cell malignancies. This program was also partnered with Novartis as part of our Novartis collaboration. In December 2018, as part of a strategic realignment of their pipeline, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights to XmAb13676, which is effective June 21, 2019. Under the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will be responsible for funding its share of the development costs for the program through June 2020. We plan to continue develop XmAb13676 as planned and expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 study in the second half of 2019. \n \u00b7 XmAb18087 is a bispecific that targets somatostatin receptor 2, or SSTR2, and the cytotoxic T-cell binding domain CD3 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In February 2018, we dosed our first patient in a Phase 1 study. XmAb18087 is our first CD3 bispecific to be evaluated in solid tumors. We expect to provide initial data from this study in the second half of 2019. \nWe are also advancing into clinical development a suite of tumor microenvironment activators that have been designed to promote tumor-selective T-cell activation by targeting multiple checkpoint or co-stimulatory receptors. We are advancing three TME activator candidates through clinical development: XmAb20717, XmAb22841, and XmAb23104:\n \u00b7 XmAb20717 simultaneously targets PD-1 and CTLA-4 and is being developed in broad oncology indications including solid tumors. In July 2018, we dosed the first patient in an open label Phase 1 dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb20717 in patients with selected solid tumors. We expect to provide initial data from this study in the second half of 2019. \n \u00b7 XmAb23104 targets PD-1 and ICOS, an immune co-stimulatory receptor, and is being developed for multiple oncology indications. In October 2018, the FDA approved our IND application for the study of XmAb23104. We have planned an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb23104 in patients with selected solid tumors, and we plan to dose the first patient in the first half of 2019. \n \u00b7 XmAb22841 targets CTLA-4 and LAG-3, also an immune checkpoint receptor, and is being developed for multiple indications. We intend to advance XmAb22841 in combination with an anti-PD-1 drug to create a triple checkpoint blockade. In November 2018, the FDA approved our IND application for the study of XmAb22841. We have planned an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb22841 in patients with selected solid tumors, and we plan to dose the first patient in the first half of 2019. \nIn 2018, we expanded our bispecific Fc platform with the design of our novel cytokine candidates. These cytokines are built on our bispecific Fc domain and have potency tuned to improve therapeutic index. These candidates also incorporate our Xtend technology for longer duration of action. Our first cytokine candidate is XmAb24306, an IL15/IL15-receptior alpha complex fused to a bispecific domain (IL15/IL15Ra-Fc). We believe that IL-15 cytokines, like XmAb24306, will be an optimal candidate for oncology combination therapies.\n \u00b7 XmAb24306 is currently in IND-enabling studies, and we will support Genentech's efforts to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019. We believe a broad combination development strategy will be critical to realize the potential of IL-15 cytokines. In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, whereby the companies will co-develop XmAb24306 and other potential IL-15 programs. \nWe have also created a suite of wholly-owned compounds using our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain.\n \u00b7 XmAb5871 uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and targets CD19 with its variable domain, which is designed to inhibit the function of B cells, an important component of the immune system. We have completed Phase 2 clinical trials for XmAb5871 in three autoimmune diseases: SLE, IgG4-RD, and RA. \nIn October 2018, we presented topline data from the Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with no loss of improvement (LOI) (i.e. maintenance of improvement) in the efficacy-evaluable population. Improvement was maintained at Day 225 by 42% of patients in the XmAb5871-treated arm, compared to 28.6% of patients in the placebo-treated arm, which did not meet the primary endpoint for statistical significance.\nThe SLE study did meet secondary endpoints included evaluations of time to LOI. Patients in the efficacy-evaluable population treated with XmAb5871 experienced a statistically significant longer time to LOI, compared to placebo-treated patients, which represented a 76% improvement in median time to LOI and a 47% reduction in risk of LOI. XmAb5871 was well tolerated, and its safety profile was consistent with previous trials.\nIn November 2017 we presented final data from the IgG4-RD Phase 2 trial at the ACR annual meeting.\nWe have also completed an additional Phase 1 trial for a subcutaneous formulation of XmAb5871.\nWe believe that the data from the studies of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE and IgG4-RD support further development in these indications and show the potential of XmAb5871 in other B-cell mediated autoimmune indications. We are seeking to partner XmAb5871 with a partner that has the infrastructure and resources to continue late-stage development of XmAb5871 and maximize the potential of this candidate for a broad set of patient populations.\n \u00b7 XmAb7195 uses our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and is being developed for the treatment of severe asthma and allergic diseases. In May 2016, we reported complete data from the Phase 1a trial with XmAb7195 treating subjects with high baseline IgE levels. In 2017 we announced data from a Phase 1b trial for XmAb7195 with a subcutaneous formulation. The data from the trial showed that subcutaneous administration of XmAb7195 was well tolerated and effective at reducing free and total IgE levels in subjects in the study. The results support subcutaneous delivery for future development. We are seeking a development partner for XmAb7195. \nWe have also created antibodies which we have licensed to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for further development. These include MOR208, an antibody in Phase 3 development, which we licensed to MorphoSys, and a CD38 x CD3 bispecific antibody candidate which included XmAb13551 and antibody components used to assemble AMG424, which we licensed to Amgen. In 2017 MorphoSys advanced MOR208 into a Phase 3 clinical trial and MorphoSys has indicated plans to file a BLA in the U.S. in 2019. Amgen has started a Phase 1 study for AMG424 and also has a preclinical candidate, AMG509, that was created with our bispecific Fc domain, advancing into development. There are currently five other programs where we have licensed our technology to partners for use in development programs with their own molecules, and four of these programs are in clinical development. The most advanced is Ultomiris, formerly ALXN1210. In 2018, Alexion submitted marketing authorization applications for Ultomiris to the regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and in December 2018, Alexion received FDA approval.\nWe have over 750 issued and pending patents worldwide to protect our XmAb technology platform and XmAb drug candidates.\nKey Company Milestones\nGenentech Collaboration: In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech (Genentech Agreement) to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics that use our bispecific Fc technology, including XmAb24306, in the areas of cancer immunotherapy. We will jointly collaborate on the worldwide development of XmAb24306 and other IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, each a Collaboration Product\u201d with Genentech maintaining worldwide commercialization rights, subject to us having a co-promotion option in the U.S. We retained the right to perform clinical studies of Collaboration Products in combination with other therapeutic agents, subject to certain requirements. Genentech received a worldwide exclusive license to the XmAb24306 and other Collaboration Products.\nUnder the Genentech Agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $120 million and are eligible to receive up to $160 million in clinical milestone payments for each Collaboration Product that advances to Phase 3 clinical trials. We are eligible to receive a 45% share of net profits from sales of XmAb24306 and other Collaboratio Products, while also sharing in the net losses at the same percentage rate and we will jointly share in 45% of development and commercialization costs. We will conduct a two-year joint research program with Genentech to discover additional programs around the IL-15 cytokine technology and will receive a $20 million milestone payment upon the initiation of each Phase 1 clinical trial for each new Collaboration Product developed under a research plan.\nThe Genentech Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and closing is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019.\nNovartis Collaboration. In June 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis (Novartis Agreement) to develop and commercialize bispecific and other Fc engineered antibody drug candidates using the Company's proprietary XmAb technologies and drug candidates. Under the Novartis Agreement, we licensed certain rights to our two lead bispecific candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, to Novartis including the right for Novartis to commercialize drug products from both programs in all worldwide territories outside the U.S. We are co-developing XmAb14045 worldwide and sharing development costs equally. We will also apply our bispecific technology to up to four Novartis identified antibodies and will also license other Fc technologies to Novartis. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $150 million and are eligible to receive up to $2.1 billion in milestone payments under the Novartis Agreement.\nIn December 2018, Novartis notified us of its decision to return its rights with respect to the XmAb13676 program. Novartis will continue to fund its share of development costs for the XmAb13676 program through June 2020 and we plan to continue development of the program.\nLicensing Partnerships. In addition to Novartis and Genentech collaborations, we have four other licensing partnerships for the licensing of our XmAb technology. These arrangements provide research funding, upfront payments and annual licensing fees in addition to potential milestones and contractual payments as our partners advance compounds that incorporate our technology through clinical development.\nDuring 2018, Alexion submitted regulatory filings for Ultomiris in the U.S., European Union and Japan. In December 2018, Alexion received approval from the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with PNH. We received a total of $20 million in regulatory milestone payments from Alexion for Ultomiris in 2018. In November 2018, Amgen began preclinical studies for AMG509, for intended clinical development for patients with prostate cancer, and we received a $0.5 million milestone payment.\nBispecific Fc programs. We continue to advance our pipeline with bispecific Fc antibodies and cytokines that incorporate our XmAb bispecific Fc domain, which allow us to create molecules that bind to multiple different targets. By using an Fc as an integral part of the molecule, we impart the advantages of natural antibody features, including enabling it to retain or enhance favorable half-life, simplifying manufacturing processes and modulating potency to reduce toxicity.\nWe have initiated the Phase 1 trials for four bispecific oncology candidates: XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, and XmAb20717. We have received FDA approval of our IND applications for our next two candidates, XmAb22841 and XmAb23104, and we will be initiating Phase 1 trials in the first half of 2019. We are in preclinical development for our first bispecific Fc domain cytokine candidate, XmAb24306, and we plan to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2019.\nIn March 2018, we completed the sale of 8,395,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten follow-on financing and raised net proceeds of $245.5 million after deducting underwriters' commissions and expense of the sale.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues\nOur revenues to date have been generated primarily from our collaboration agreements and our technology licensing agreements. Revenue recognized from our collaboration agreements includes non-refundable upfront payments and milestone payments while revenue from our technology licensing agreements includes upfront payments, annual maintenance fees, option payments to obtain commercial licenses and milestone payments. Since our inception through December 31, 2018, we have generated $266.2 million in revenues under the various product development partnership and technology license arrangements. Several of our product development partnership and technology license agreements provide us the opportunity to earn future milestone payments, royalties on product sales and option exercise payments.\nSummary of Collaboration and Licensing Revenue by Partner\nThe following is a comparison of collaboration and licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related personnel costs, supplies, facility costs and preclinical testing costs, clinical trial costs and fees paid to external service providers. External service providers include contract research organizations (CRO) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) to conduct clinical trials, manufacturing and process development, IND-enabling toxicology testing and formulation of clinical drug supplies. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expense when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. We estimate contract manufacturing, preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to the contracts with manufacturing, research institutions and clinical research organizations that manufacture and conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf based on the actual time and expenses incurred by them. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the related agreement. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and adjust estimates accordingly. Our estimates of clinical trial expense have fluctuated on a period-to-period basis due to changes in the stage of the clinical trials and patient enrollment levels. We expect to experience a continuing pattern of fluctuations in clinical trial expenses as current clinical trials are completed and as we initiate additional and later stage clinical trials. To date, we have not experienced significant differences between our periodic estimates of clinical trial expense and the actual costs incurred. We expect changes in future clinical trial expenses to be driven by changes in service provider costs and changes in clinical stage and patient enrollment. We have incurred a total of $466.1 million in research and development expenses from inception through December 31, 2018.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses may increase over spending levels in recent years if we are successful in advancing XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, XmAb24306, or any of our other preclinical programs into advanced stages of clinical development. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Numerous factors may affect the probability of success for each product candidate, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability, approval by regulatory authorities and commercial viability.\nOur research and development operations are conducted such that design, management and evaluation of results of all of our research and development is performed internally, while the execution of certain phases of our research and development programs, such as toxicology studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and manufacturing in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), is accomplished using CROs and CMOs. We account for research and development costs on a program-by-program basis except in the early stages of research and discovery, when costs are often devoted to identifying preclinical candidates and improving our discovery platform and technologies, which are not necessarily allocable to a specific development program. We assign costs for such activities to distinct projects for preclinical pipeline development and new technologies. We allocate research management, overhead, commonly used laboratory supplies and equipment, and facility costs based on the number of full-time research personnel allocated to each program.\nThe following is a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation related to our executive, finance, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include rent and utilities, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services.\nOther Income, Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our investments during the years.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Our management believes judgment is involved in determining revenue recognition, the fair value-based measurement of stock-based compensation, the fair value estimate of marketable securities, the capitalization and recoverability of intellectual property costs, valuation of deferred tax assets and accruals. Our management evaluates estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences could be material to the financial statements. If our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have, to date, earned revenue from research and development collaborations, which may include research and development services, licenses of our internally-developed technologies, licenses of our internally-developed drug candidates, or combinations of these.\nThe terms of our license and research and development and collaboration agreements generally include non-refundable upfront payments, research funding, co-development reimbursements, license fees and, milestone and other contingent payments to us for the achievement of defined collaboration objectives and certain clinical, regulatory and sales-based events, as well as royalties on sales of any commercialized products.\nThe terms of our licensing agreements include non-refundable upfront fees, annual licensing fees, and contractual payment obligations for the achievement of pre-defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based events by our partners. The licensing agreements also include royalties on sales of any commercialized products by our partners.\nAs described in Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606. Subsequent to the adoption, the Company recognizes revenue through the five-step process in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue Recognition when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company used the full retrospective method and as a result the Company has revised its comparative financial statements for the prior period as if ASC 606 had been in effect for that period.\nThe most significant changes to revenue recognition under ASC 606 relate to the timing of revenue recognized for arrangements that include licensing of our technologies. Under ASC 606 revenue related to licensing of access to our technologies is recognized at inception of the agreement, generally the effective date of the agreement. For existing licensing arrangements, the effect of ASC 606 is to shift revenue to earlier periods. Approximately $11.3 million of licensing revenue that was being recognized over the five-year period 2016-2021 is being recognized in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe other significant change under ASC 606 relates to the timing of collaboration revenue when the Company completes its performance obligations for delivery of a drug candidate to its collaboration partners after applying its technologies. For existing collaborations, the effect of ASC 606 is to accelerate revenue recognition to earlier periods. Approximately $6.25 million of collaboration revenue recognized in 2017 and 2018 under historical accounting guidance is being recognized in 2016 under ASC 606. An additional $20.5 million of collaboration revenue that would be recognized in 2018 is being recognized in 2017.\nCapitalized Intellectual Property Costs\nWe capitalize and amortize third-party intellectual property costs such as amounts paid to outside patent counsel for filing, prosecuting and obtaining patents for our internally developed technologies and product candidates, to the extent such patents are deemed to have probable future economic benefit. We also capitalize amounts paid to third parties for licenses that we acquire for intellectual property or for research and development purposes. The net capitalized patents, licenses and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $12.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively. We believe that these costs should be capitalized as the intellectual property portfolio is the underlying property right to our technologies and product candidates and supports the upfront payments, licensing fees, and milestone payments made by our collaboration partners for licensing our technologies and product candidates.\nWe begin amortization of capitalized patent costs during the period that we obtain a patent relating to the capitalized cost over the shorter of the patent life or the estimated economic useful life. Capitalized licensing costs are amortized beginning in the period that access to the license or technology is available and is amortized over the shorter of the license term or the estimated economic useful life of the licensed asset. Such amortization is reflected in the General and Administrative section of our Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nOn a regular basis we review the capitalized intellectual property portfolio and determine if there have been changes in the scientific or patent landscape that leads us to decide to abandon an in-process patent application or abandon a previously issued patent. While we confer with outside patent counsel, the decision to continue prosecuting certain patent claims or abandon other claims are made by us based on our judgment and existing knowledge of our technology, current U.S. and foreign patent authority rulings and expected rulings, and scientific advances and patent filings by competitors operating in our technology or drug development field. We record an expense for the write-off of capitalized intangible assets in the period that the decision to abandon a claim or license is made. We also review the carrying value of capitalized licensing costs on a regular basis to determine if there have been any changes to the useful life or estimated amortization period over which the costs should be amortized. We recorded a charge for abandoned intangible assets of $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Such charges are reflected in the General and Administrative section of our Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWe determine if there has been an impairment of our intangible assets which include the capitalized patent and licensing costs whenever events such as recurring operating losses or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\n \u00b7 contract research organizations and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of and testing of clinical trial materials; and \n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities. \nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing these costs, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed for which we have not been invoiced and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more-likely-than not threshold of that position being sustained. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company has concluded that there are no material uncertain tax positions and has not recorded an income tax expense or liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) was enacted into law, which beginning in 2018, made several changes to U.S. corporate income tax provisions. We have identified changes in the TCJA which will have a material effect on our tax provision and future tax obligations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate rate from a maximum rate of 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effect of this change was to reduce the potential future tax benefits from our deferred tax assets by $19.6 million that we had as of December 31, 2017. We have deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2017 from deferred revenue and net operating loss carryforwards and the reduction in the U.S. rate reduced the future value of these assets. The TCJA also changed the potential benefit of net operating losses incurred after January 1, 2018. The new law eliminated the ability to carryback net operating losses to prior years and also limited the amount of net operating losses incurred post January 1, 2018 that could be used to offset taxable income to 80% of the taxable income generated in any one year.\nThe other material change in our tax provision from the TCJA is elimination of the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) system and allowance for a tax refund for AMT credit carryovers as of December 31, 2017. We recorded an income tax receivable related to AMT credit carryovers of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe recorded net deferred tax assets of $82.5 million as of December 31, 2018, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. The deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of deferred revenue, federal and state tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $191.2 million; $102.6 million of such losses were incurred prior to December 31, 2017 and $88.6 million were incurred in the year December 31, 2018. We also had available tax credit carryforwards of $14.9 million for federal tax purposes. We had cumulative state tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018 of $138.9 million, and available state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $8.2 million, which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any.\nOur federal net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to January 1, 2018, expire starting in 2026, state net operating losses expire starting in 2031, and federal tax credit carryforwards expire starting in 2019. Upon analysis, we believe that our net operating losses and tax credits were subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 under Section 382 and similar state provisions. As a result of the limitations under Section 382, our federal and state tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have been limited.\nNo income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded a net benefit of $0.5 million, related to federal and state AMTs, for the year ended December 31, 2017, and we recorded a tax expense of $1.0 million, related to federal and state AMTs for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nWe record the fair value of stock options and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to employees as of the grant date as compensation expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. For non-employees, we also record the fair value of stock options as of the grant date as compensation expense over the service period. We then periodically re-measure the awards to reflect the current fair value at each reporting period until the non-employee completes the performance obligation or the date on which a performance commitment is reached. Expense is recognized over the related service period.\nWe calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.\nCommon Stock Options Fair Value\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The use of a Black-Scholes model requires us to apply judgment and make assumptions and estimates that include the following:\n \u00b7 Expected Volatility-Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. As we do not yet have sufficient history of our own volatility, we have identified several public entities of similar size, complexity and stage of development and calculate the historical volatility using the volatility of these companies. \n \u00b7 Expected Dividend Yield-We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. \n \u00b7 Risk-Free Interest Rate-This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of each option grant during the year, having a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option. \n \u00b7 Expected Term-This is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised. Options granted have a maximum term of ten years and we have estimated the expected life of the option term to be between five and six years. We use a simplified method to calculate the average expected term for employee awards. \nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):\n \n\nRevenues\nResearch collaboration revenues in 2018 and 2017 represent revenue recognized under our Novartis Agreement.\nMilestone and contingent payments decreased by $5.5 million in 2018 over 2017 amounts primarily due to receiving contractual milestones in 2017 from Amgen, CSL and MorphoSys compared to contractual milestones received from Alexion in 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $25.7 million in 2018 over 2017 amounts as we continue to expand our pipeline of bispecific Fc domain candidates. Increased spending on our bispecific TME checkpoint candidates and our IL-15 cytokine program was the primary driver for increased spending. Increased spending on our XmAb5871 program and early discovery research programs was partially offset by reduced spending on our XmAb7195 program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $5.0 million in 2018 over 2017 amounts primarily due to an increase in facility costs, staffing and stock-based compensation costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net increased by $4.8 million in 2018 over 2017 amounts reflecting additional interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities, which is due to higher investment balances as a result of our March 2018 financing.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\nRevenues\nResearch collaboration revenues decreased by $14.2 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts primarily due to revenue recognized under our Novartis collaboration in 2017 compared to revenue recognized under our Novartis and Amgen collaborations in 2016.\nMilestone and contingent payments increased by $21.0 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts primarily due to receiving contractual milestones in 2017 from Amgen, CSL, and MorphoSys, compared to contractual milestones received from Alexion in 2016.\nLicensing revenue decreased by $69.7 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts due to revenue reported under our Novartis collaboration in 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $19.9 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts as we continue to expand our pipeline of bispecific candidates. The primary increases in research and development spending were on our bispecific TME checkpoint and CD-3 programs. Increased spending on our XmAb5871 program and early discovery research programs was partially offset by reduced spending on our XmAb7195 program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4.4 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts primarily due to an increase in facility costs, staffing and stock-based compensation costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net increased by $2.1 million in 2017 over 2016 amounts, reflecting additional interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our operations have been primarily financed through proceeds from our public offering, private sales of our equity, convertible notes and payments received under our collaboration and development partnerships and licensing arrangements. We have devoted our resources to funding research and development programs, including discovery research, preclinical and clinical development activities.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses into the foreseeable future as we advance the ongoing development of our bispecific Fc domain pipeline of product candidates, XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087, XmAb20717, XmAb22841, XmAb23104, and XmAb24306, evaluate opportunities for the potential clinical development of our other preclinical programs, and continue our research efforts.\nIn March 2018, we finalized the sale of 8,395,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $31.00 per share in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.5 million, after deducting underwriters' commissions and offering expenses.\nIn July 2016 we received a $150.0 million upfront payment in connection with our collaboration with Novartis. On December 6, 2016, we finalized the sale of 5,272,750 shares of common stock at an offering price of $24.00 per share in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $119.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nOn September 19, 2016, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with Piper Jaffray & Co (Piper Jaffray) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $40 million of common stock through Piper Jaffray as sales agent. The issuance and sale of these shares by Xencor under the Distribution Agreement will be pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No.333-213700) declared effective by the SEC on October 5, 2016.\nTo date, we have not sold any shares under the Distribution Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $530.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $363.3 million at December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to receive additional payments from our collaborators for research and development services rendered, additional milestone, contingent payments, opt-in and annual license maintenance payments. We expect to close the Genentech transaction in the first quarter of 2019, for which we will receive a $120 million non-refundable upfront payment 30 days after the effective date. Our ability to receive milestone payments and contingent payments from our partners is dependent upon either our ability or our partners' abilities to achieve certain levels of research and development activities and is therefore uncertain at this time.\nFunding Requirements\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. As we are currently in the early clinical stages of development, it will be some time before we expect to achieve this and it is uncertain that we ever will. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase in connection with ongoing as well as additional planned clinical and preclinical development of product candidates in our pipeline. We expect to continue our collaboration arrangements and will look for additional collaboration and licensing opportunities.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict our funding requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain potential milestone payments will fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reflects operating expenses primarily for advancing our bispecific candidates and clinical trials for XmAb5871 during the year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects the upfront payment of $150.0 million received under our Novartis collaboration and a milestone payment from Alexion in excess of operating expenses during the year.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities consist primarily of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities offset by purchases of marketable securities available-for-sale, acquisition of intangible assets and purchases of property and equipment. In 2018, we purchased $155.7 million in marketable securities, net of $222.1 million of proceeds from sale and maturities. In 2017 we received $39.2 million in marketable securities, net of $76.5 million of purchases. In 2016, we invested $210.6 million in marketable securities net of $105.5 million of sales and maturities. We acquired $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million of intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We purchased $7.2 million, $5.3 million and $1.5 million of capital equipment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The increase in capital expenditure in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to additional purchase of research and development equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consists primarily of net proceeds from the follow-on equity offering and cash from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the ESPP.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 consists primarily of cash from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the ESPP.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consists primarily of net proceeds from the follow-on equity offering and cash from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the ESPP.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Consists of operating leases on our corporate headquarters in Monrovia and on our San Diego offices encompassing 48,000 square feet and 24,000 square feet that expire in September 2022 and August 2022 respectively. \nWe are obligated to make future payments to third parties under in-license agreements, including sublicense fees, royalties, and payments that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones. We have also entered into agreements with third party vendors which will require us to make future payments upon the delivery of goods and services in future periods.\nIn February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with BIO-TECHNE Corporation for a non-exclusive license to certain antibody technology including monoclonal antibodies which recognize human somatostatin reception 2. The variable domain of this antibody is incorporated in our XmAb18087 drug candidate. Under this license agreement, we may be required to make $3.8 million in additional contingent payments which include $800,000 of clinical milestones and $3.0 million of regulatory milestones, in addition to royalties upon commercial sales of products of less than 1%. We made an upfront payment of $200,000 in connection with this license and made a Phase 1 milestone payment of $100,000 in 2018. We did not make any milestone payments in 2017 or 2016.\nIn January 2019, we entered into a second agreement with BIO-TECHNE which agreement is effective February 2018 for a non-exclusive license to certain recombinant monoclonal antibody reactive with human programmed death protein, PD-1 antibody. We expect to use this protein in certain of our oncology drug candidates.
