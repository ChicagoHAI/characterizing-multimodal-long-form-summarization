Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This report contains certain forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information which speaks only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to update this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to by law. For a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance, see the discussion under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and under the caption Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\u201d below. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur.\nBusiness Overview and Background\nWe are a leading global provider of software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d) and solutions for the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d). We sell telematics solutions globally under the Ctrack brand, including our fleet management, asset tracking and monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery and usage-based insurance platforms. We also sell connectivity solutions and device management services. Our products and solutions provide anywhere, anytime communications and analytics for consumers and businesses of all sizes, with approximately 620,000 global subscribers, including 432,000 subscribers for our Ctrack branded fleet management and vehicle telematics solutions and 188,000 subscribers for our connectivity and device management services.\nWe have invented and reinvented ways in which the world stays connected and accesses information. With multiple first-to-market innovations and a strong and growing portfolio of hardware and software innovations for IoT, our companies have been advancing technology and driving industry transformation for over 30 years. It is this proven expertise and commitment to quality and innovation that makes us a preferred global partner of operators, distributors, system integrators, businesses and consumers.\nWe sell SaaS, software and services solutions across multiple IoT vertical markets, including fleet management and vehicle telematics, usage-based insurance, stolen vehicle recovery, asset tracking and monitoring, business connectivity, and device management. Our platforms are device-agnostic and provide a standardized, scalable way to order, connect and manage remote assets and improve business operations. The platforms are flexible and support both on-premise server or cloud-based deployments and are the basis for the delivery of a wide range of IoT services.\nOur SaaS delivery platforms include (i) our Ctrack platforms, which provide fleet, vehicle, asset and other SaaS telematics, (ii) our Crossroads\u2122 platform, which provides easy IoT device management and service enablement and (iii) our Device Management Solutions ( DMS\u201d), a hosted SaaS platform that helps organizations manage the selection, deployment, and spend of their wireless assets, saving money on personnel and telecom expenses.\nOur integrated telematics and mobile tracking hardware is predominantly sold as an enabler for our Ctrack SaaS delivery platforms. Our telematics and mobile tracking hardware devices collect and control critical vehicle data and driver behaviors, and can reliably deliver that information to the cloud, all managed by our services enablement platforms. Our wireless routers are sold both as stand-alone devices and as part of a bundled business connectivity solution, including our Crossroads platform and wireless connectivity services via our carrier partners.\nOur telematics customer base is comprised of wireless operators, distributors, OEMs and companies in various vertical markets. Fleet management customers include global enterprises such as BHP Billiton, Super Group, Mammoet, and Australia Post. Customers of our government, local council and municipality asset management platforms include Thames Water and the City of Ekurhuleni. Airport asset tracking customers include KLM Equipment Services and Hanover Airport. Usage-based insurances customers include Discovery Insure and Cross Country Insurance Consultants. Our largest vehicle tracking customer is the South African Police Service.\nWe have strategic technology, development and marketing relationships with several of our customers and partners. Our strong customer and partner relationships provide us with the opportunity to expand our market reach and sales. We partner with leading OEMs, telecom groups and installation partners which allows us to offer customers integrated and holistic solutions. Ctrack uses leading cellular providers such as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Vodafone, MTN, Telstra and Optus to ensure the optimal real-time visibility of tracked vehicles and systems, supported by accurate and sophisticated mapping services such as the HERE Open Location Platform.\nThe hardware used in our solutions is produced by contract manufacturers. Their services include component procurement, assembly, testing, quality control and fulfillment. Our contract manufacturers include Inventec Appliances\nCorporation and AsiaTelco Technologies Co. Under our manufacturing agreements, contract manufacturers provide us with services including component procurement, product manufacturing, final assembly, testing, quality control and fulfillment.\nMerger, Acquisition and Divestiture Activities\nAcquisitions\nDigiCore Holdings Limited (DBA Ctrack)\nOn June 18, 2015, we entered into a transaction implementation agreement (the TIA\u201d) with DigiCore. Pursuant to the terms of the TIA, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of DigiCore (with the exception of certain excluded shares, including treasury shares) for 4.40 South African Rand per ordinary share outstanding.\nOn October 5, 2015, the transaction was completed. The total preliminary purchase price was approximately $80.0 million and included (i) cash consideration of $79.4 million for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of DigiCore and the purchase of in-the-money vested stock options held by Ctrack employees on the closing date and (ii) $0.6 million for the portion of the fair value of replacement equity awards issued to Ctrack employees that related to services performed prior to the closing date. Upon consummation of the acquisition, Ctrack became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nR.E.R. Enterprises, Inc. (DBA Feeney Wireless)\nOn March 27, 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of R.E.R. Enterprises, Inc. ( RER\u201d) and its wholly-owned subsidiary and principal operating asset, FW. The total purchase price was approximately $24.8 million and included a cash payment at closing of approximately $9.3 million, including $1.5 million which was placed into an escrow fund to serve as partial security for the indemnification obligations of RER and its former shareholders, the Company's assumption of $0.5 million in certain transaction-related expenses incurred by FW, and the future issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $15.0 million to RER's former shareholders, which would have been payable in March 2016.\nThe total consideration of $24.8 million paid by the Company for FW did not include amounts, if any, payable under an earn-out arrangement pursuant to which we may have been required to pay up to an additional $25.0 million to the former shareholders of RER contingent upon FW's achievement of certain financial targets for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (the Earn-Out Arrangement\u201d).\nOn January 5, 2016, the Company and RER amended certain payment terms related to the Company's acquisition of RER (the RER Amendment\u201d). Under the RER Amendment, the $1.5 million placed into escrow on the date of acquisition was released to RER and its former shareholders on January 8, 2016, and the $15.0 million that was payable in shares of our common stock in March 2016 will now be paid in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016. Under the RER Amendment, the Earn-Out Arrangement has been amended (the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement\u201d) as follows: (a) any amount earned under the Earn-Out Arrangement for the achievement of financial targets for the year ended December 31, 2015 will now be paid in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016 and (b) in replacement of the potential earn-out contingent upon FW's achievement of certain financial targets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, we will issue to the former shareholders of RER approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock in three equal installments over a three-year period, beginning in March 2017.\nWe recognized approximately $7.9 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the earn-out payment due to the former shareholders of RER in the form of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount earned pursuant to the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement was $14.0 million, $12.5 million of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRecent and Pending Divestitures\nModules Business\nOn April 11, 2016, we signed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Telit Technologies (Cyprus) Limited and Telit Wireless Solutions, Inc. (collectively, Telit\u201d) pursuant to which we sold, and Telit acquired, certain hardware modules and related assets (the Modules Business\u201d) for an initial purchase price of $11.0 million in cash, which included $9.0 million that was paid to us on the closing date of the transaction, $1.0 million that would be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over a two-year period in connection with the provision by us of certain transition services and $1.0 million that would be paid to us following the satisfaction of certain conditions by us, including the assignment of specified contracts and the delivery of certain certifications and approvals. We also had the potential to receive an additional cash payment of approximately $3.8 million from Telit related to their purchase of module product inventory from us, $1.0 million of which would be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over the two-year period following the closing date in connection with the provision by us of certain\ntransition services. In addition to the above, we may have been entitled to receive a subsequent earn-out payment following the closing of the transaction if certain conditions are met.\nOn September 29, 2016, we entered into a Final Resolution Letter Agreement (the Final Resolution\u201d) with Telit. Per the Final Resolution, Telit agreed to pay us $2.1 million in full satisfaction of their payment obligations under certain sections of the original purchase agreement, including all installment payments, and we agreed to ship the remainder of the hardware modules and related assets as soon as practicable. Under the Final Resolution, the aggregate purchase consideration totaled $11.7 million, which consisted of $11.3 million in cash and $0.4 million in net settled Company liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain of approximately $5.0 million in connection with the fulfillment of certain obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, as amended, which is included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a liability of $0.5 million for the fair value of the remaining hardware and related assets due to Telit, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nMiFi Business\nOn September 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d), by and among Inseego and Novatel Wireless, on the one hand, and T.C.L. Industries Holdings (H.K.) Limited and Jade Ocean Global Limited (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) on the other hand. The Purchase Agreement relates to the pending sale of our subsidiary, Novatel Wireless, which includes the Company's MiFi branded hotspots and USB modem product lines (the MiFi Business\u201d), to the Purchasers for $50.0 million in cash, subject to potential adjustment for Novatel Wireless's working capital as of the closing date. The sale may not close until all of the closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied. One of the closing conditions is the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS\u201d). CFIUS has identified national security concerns relating to our sale of the MiFi Business to the Purchasers. In early February 2017, the Company and the Purchasers voluntarily withdrew and re-filed their notice to CFIUS in order to obtain additional time to provide further information to CFIUS and explore potential mitigation measures that may allow the transaction to proceed. In early March 2017, CFIUS provided a draft mitigation agreement which, if finalized, would allow CFIUS approval to be granted. Negotiations between CFIUS and the Purchasers regarding the final terms of such mitigation agreement remain ongoing.\nIn order to facilitate our sale of Novatel Wireless, we completed an internal Reorganization in November 2016. The first step of the Reorganization was the formation of Inseego (formerly known as Vanilla Technologies, Inc.) as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Novatel Wireless. Inseego then formed Vanilla Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inseego ( Merger Sub\u201d). Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Reorganization.\nNovatel Wireless then contributed all of its assets and liabilities (other than the MiFi Business), including its equity interests in DigiCore, FW, Novatel Wireless Solutions, Inc., Enfora Comercio de Eletronicos LTDA and each of their direct and indirect subsidiaries, to Inseego.\nFinally, Merger Sub was merged with and into Novatel Wireless, with Novatel Wireless surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inseego. Upon completion of the Reorganization, each share of Novatel Wireless common stock was automatically converted into a corresponding share of Inseego common stock, having the same rights and limitations as the corresponding share of Novatel Wireless common stock that was converted. Accordingly, at such time, Novatel Wireless's former stockholders became stockholders of Inseego.\nThe purpose and effect of the Reorganization was to separate the MiFi Business from the assets and liabilities associated with the Ctrack fleet and vehicle telematics solutions and stolen vehicle recovery and FW telemetry and connectivity solutions businesses.\nBusiness Segment Reporting\nWe do not provide separate segment reporting for our various lines of business. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker, evaluates the business as a single entity and reviews financial information and makes business decisions based on the overall results of the business. As such, the Company's operations constitute a single operating segment and one reportable segment.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nNet Revenues. We believe that our future net revenues will be influenced largely by the global demand for SaaS solutions for telematics, including our Ctrack fleet management, asset tracking and monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery, and usage-based insurance platforms. Our future net revenues will also be influenced by the demand in North America for our business connectivity solutions and device management services, as well as customer acceptance of our new products that address our markets and our ability to meet customer demand. Factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>economic environment and related market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased competition from other fleet and vehicle telematics solutions, as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain wireless data access or device management feature;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>rate of change to new products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>product pricing; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our revenues are also significantly dependent upon the availability of materials and components used in our hardware products.\nWe anticipate introducing additional products during the next twelve months, including SaaS telematics solutions and additional service offerings. We continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders such as Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Vodafone, MTN, Telstra and Optus. Through strategic relationships, we have been able to maintain market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners, including their access to distribution resources, increased sales opportunities and market opportunities.\nOur future net revenues will also be affected by the consummation of the sale of our Modules Business and the pending sale of our MiFi Business.\nCost of Net Revenues. Cost of net revenues includes all costs associated with our contract manufacturers, distribution, fulfillment and repair services, delivery of SaaS services, warranty costs, amortization of intangible assets, royalties, operations overhead, costs associated with our cancellation of purchase orders, and costs related to outside services. Also included in cost of net revenues are costs related to inventory adjustments, including the FW and Ctrack acquisition-related amortization of the fair value of inventory, as well as any write downs for excess and obsolete inventory and abandoned product lines. Inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products, which is influenced by the factors discussed above.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Our operating costs consist of three primary categories: research and development; sales and marketing; and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and development is at the core of our ability to produce innovative, leading-edge products. These expenses consist primarily of engineers and technicians who design and test our highly complex products and the procurement of testing and certification services.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of our sales force and product-marketing professionals. In order to maintain strong sales relationships, we provide co-marketing, trade show support and product training. We are also engaged in a wide variety of activities, such as awareness and lead generation programs as well as product marketing. Other marketing initiatives include public relations, seminars and co-branding with partners.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include primarily corporate functions such as accounting, human resources, legal, administrative support, and professional fees. This category also includes the expenses needed to operate as a publicly-traded company, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, SEC filings, stock exchange fees, and investor relations expense. Although general and administrative expenses are not directly related to revenue levels, certain expenses such as legal expenses and provisions for bad debts may cause significant volatility in future general and administrative expenses.\nWe have undertaken certain restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. Restructuring charges consist primarily of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce and facility exit related costs.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review, and intend to continue to review, acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. Given our current cash position and recent losses, any additional acquisitions we make would likely involve issuing stock and/or borrowing additional funds in order to\nprovide the purchase consideration for the acquisitions. If we make any additional acquisitions, we may incur substantial expenditures in conjunction with the acquisition process and the subsequent assimilation of any acquired business, products, technologies or personnel.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.\nTable

Concurrently with the acquisition of FW, we amended the Revolver to include FW as a borrower and Loan Party, as defined by the agreement. On November 17, 2015, the Revolver was amended to increase the\nmaximum borrowing capacity to $48.0 million. The amount of borrowings that may be made under the Revolver are based on a borrowing base and are comprised of a specified percentage of eligible receivables. If, at any time during the term of the Revolver, the amount of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver exceeds the borrowing base then in effect, we would be required to repay such borrowings in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. The Revolver includes $3.0 million available for letters of credit, $0.7 million of which was available for letters of credit at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolver and we had available borrowings of approximately $4.7 million.\nOn March 20, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Revolver was amended (the Amendment\u201d). The Amendment, made at the Company's request, amended and updated the financial covenants with respect to liquidity requirements and EBITDA targets, among other things, in order to enable draw-downs by the Company from time to time. In exchange for such accommodations, the Amendment also decreased the aggregate amount available under the Revolver from $48.0 million to $10.0 million and increased the applicable margin to 4.00% when interest is based on the daily three month LIBOR rate and 1.5% when interest is based on the prime rate.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn June 10, 2015, Novatel Wireless issued $120.0 million of the Novatel Wireless Notes, which are governed by the terms of the Novatel Wireless Indenture among Novatel Wireless, as issuer, Inseego and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, as amended by certain supplemental indentures. The Novatel Wireless Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Novatel Wireless and bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015.

Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to gross proceeds from the issuance of the Novatel Wireless Notes and the exercise of the 2014 Warrant, partially offset by the payment of issuance costs related to the Novatel Wireless Notes, net repayments on our Revolver and the payoff of the FW assumed credit line and certain capital lease obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016, and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>> 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Novatel Wireless Notes(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DigiCore mortgage bond(2)\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DigiCore bank facilities(2)\n</td> <td>3,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RER Amendment and Amended Earn-Out Arrangement\n</td> <td>15,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>1,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>7,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the outstanding borrowings and contractually required interest payments to Novatel Wireless Note holders at December 31, 2016, assuming no repurchases or conversions of the Novatel Wireless Notes prior to June 15, 2020, the maturity date.

At December 31, 2016, we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.9 million, working capital of $6.1 million and available borrowings under the Revolver of approximately $4.7 million.\nOur ability to transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. If events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required to reduce planned research and development activities, incur additional restructuring charges or reduce other operating expenses which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Revolver, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from the completion of the pending sale of the MiFi Business, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months following the filing date of this report.\nOur historical operating results, primarily those related to the MiFi Business, indicate that substantial doubt exists related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that the closing of the sale of the MiFi Business is probable of occurring and mitigating the substantial doubt raised by our historical operating results and will satisfy our estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months following the filing date of this report. In the unlikely event that the sale of the MiFi Business does not close, we would require an alternative source of financing in order to divest the MiFi Business elsewhere or to otherwise streamline the MiFi Business as may be needed. In order to obtain such alternative financing, we must comply with certain requirements under the Revolver and the Inseego Indenture. We have had discussions with potential financing sources, and we believe that it is probable that such financing would be available to the Company based on terms that have been presented to the Company by financial sources.\nWe cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of the sale of the MiFi Business or any other activities to generate liquidity, including the availability of additional financing. If we are not able to generate additional liquidity through the mechanisms described above or through some combination of other actions, while not expected, we may not be able to access funds under our Revolver, and we may need to secure additional sources of funds, which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to production, inventory or services that are important to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations, a material failure to satisfy our contractual commitments or a failure to generate revenue from new or existing products.\nWe may also raise additional funds to accelerate development of new and existing services and products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. There can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, in order to obtain additional borrowings, we must comply with certain requirements under the Revolver and the Inseego Indenture. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interests and securities\nissued may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities, we may be subject to certain limitations on our operations. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our results of operations, financial conditions or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenues from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators, OEM customers and value added resellers and distributors. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of asset-management solutions utilizing wireless technology and M2M communication devices to transportation and industrial companies, medical device manufacturers and security system providers. Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon the later of transfer of title or delivery of the product to the customer. Where the transfer of title or risk of loss is contingent on the customer's acceptance of the product, we will not recognize revenue until both title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. We recognize revenues from SaaS services pro-rata over the contract term. We record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of when revenue recognition criteria are met. We have granted price protection to certain customers in accordance with the provisions of the respective contracts and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions. We estimate the amount of price protection for current period product sales utilizing historical experience and information regarding customer inventory levels. To date, we have not incurred material price protection obligations. Revenues from sales to certain customers are subject to cooperative advertising allowances. Cooperative advertising allowances are recorded as an operating expense to the extent that the advertising benefit is separable from the revenue transaction and the fair value of that advertising benefit is determinable. To the extent that such allowances either do not provide a separable benefit to us, or the fair value of the advertising benefit cannot be reliably estimated, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized. In estimating future product returns, we consider various factors, including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends.\nWe record our hardware revenue associated with the agreed upon price on hardware sales, and accrue any estimated costs of post-delivery performance obligations, such as warranty obligations. We consider the four basic revenue recognition criteria discussed under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 when assessing appropriate revenue recognition as follows:\nCriterion #1 - Persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist;\nCriterion #2 - Delivery has occurred;\nCriterion #3 - Our price to the buyer must be fixed or determinable; and,\nCriterion #4 - Collectability is reasonably assured.\nFor multiple element arrangements, total consideration received from customers is allocated to the elements. This may include hardware, non-essential software elements and/or essential software, based on a relative selling price. The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendors specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), (ii) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), and (iii) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d). Because we have neither VSOE nor TPE, revenue has been based on our BESP. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of the sale provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Amounts allocated to other deliverables based upon BESP are recognized in the period the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur process for determining BESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Our prices are determined based upon cost to produce our products, expected order quantities and acceptance in the marketplace. In addition, when developing BESPs for products, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives (if they exist) and product-specific business objectives.\nWe account for multiple element arrangements that primarily consist of software licenses and post contract support ( PCS\u201d) by recognizing revenue for such arrangements ratably over the term of the PCS as we have not established VSOE for the PCS element.\nWe provide SaaS subscriptions for our fleet and vehicle management solutions in which customers are provided with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile assets via software applications hosted by us. The customer has the option to purchase the monitoring device or lease it over the term of the contract. If the customer purchases the monitoring device, we recognize the revenue at the time of purchase. If the customer chooses to lease the monitoring device, we recognize the revenue for the monitoring device over the term of the contract. The Company records such revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 840, Leases, as we have determined that they qualify as operating leases. We recognize revenues from SaaS services over the term of the contract.\nCertain of our revenue is based on contractual arrangements. In such instances, management considers the nature of the Company's contractual arrangements in determining whether to recognize certain types of revenue on the basis of the gross amount billed or net amount retained after payments are made to providers of certain services related to the product or service offering. The main factors we use to determine whether to record revenue on a gross or net basis are whether:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we are primarily responsible for the service to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have discretion in establishing fees paid by the customer; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we are involved in the determination of product or service specifications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When the customer's fee includes a portion of charges that are paid to another party and we are primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis in an amount equal to the fee paid by the customer. The cost of revenues recognized is the amount due to the other party and is recorded as cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. In instances in which another party is primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer, revenue is recognized in the net amount retained by the Company. The portion of the fees that we collect from the customer and remit to the other party are considered pass through amounts and accordingly are not a component of net revenues or cost of net revenues.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers' inability to pay. We determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions, historical losses, and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers' credit-worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, we review our customers' credit-worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services, our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers' industries. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nProvision for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Write-downs in inventory value or losses on inventory purchase commitments depend on various items, including factors related to customer demand, economic and competitive conditions, technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Whenever inventory is written down, a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve.\nWe believe that, when made, the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory. If customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates, inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisitions. When acquiring companies, we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support liabilities assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience, market data and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets the Company has acquired include but are not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from customer relationships; (ii) estimates to develop or use technology; and (iii) discount rates.\nIf management determines that a pre-acquisition contingency is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date, we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary fair value allocation. We continue to gather information for and evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, such amounts will be included in the fair value allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of operations.\nWe may be required to pay future consideration to the former shareholders of acquired companies, depending on the terms of the applicable purchase agreements, which may be contingent upon the achievement of certain financial and operating targets, as well as the retention of key employees. If the future consideration is considered to be compensation, amounts will be expensed when incurred.\nPurchased Intangible Assets. In determining the fair value allocation for our acquisitions, we considered, among other factors, our intended uses of the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for the acquired company's products and services. The estimated fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach. The income approach relies on an estimation of the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owner of an asset during its remaining economic life. This approach requires a projection of the cash flow that the asset is expected to generate in the future. The projected cash flow is discounted to its present value using a rate of return, or discount rate that accounts for the time value of money and the degree of risks inherent in the asset. The expected future cash flow that is projected should include all of the economic benefits attributable to the asset, including the tax savings associated with the amortization of the intangible asset value over the tax life of the asset. The income approach may take the form of a relief from royalty\u201d methodology, a cost savings methodology, a with and without\u201d methodology, or excess earnings methodology, depending on the specific asset under consideration.\nLong-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of the unamortized balances of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, rental assets and intangible assets, which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. We consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry or economic trends.\nOur assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to their associated undiscounted expected future cash flows, which are determined using an expected cash flow model. This model requires estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital and other relevant factors. We estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and other industry data. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThe timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long-lived assets below their carrying value. We monitor our long-lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present. We believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value long-lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management. The majority of our long-lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over approximately two to ten years. As most of these assets are associated with technology or trade conditions that may change rapidly; such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis.\nValuation of Goodwill. Our goodwill resulted from our acquisitions of FW and Ctrack during 2015. In accordance with the ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we will review goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value.\nConvertible Debt. We account for convertible debt instruments that are settleable in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) by separating the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects our\nnonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We determine the carrying amount of the liability component by measuring the fair value of similar debt instruments that do not have the conversion feature. If a similar debt instrument does not exist, we estimate the fair value by using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing a debt instrument, including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities. Determining the fair value of the debt component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the debt component and the associated non-cash interest expense.\nUpon issuance, we assign a value to the debt component equal to the estimated fair value of similar debt instruments without the conversion feature, which could result in our recording the debt instrument at a discount. If the debt instrument is recorded at a discount, we amortize the debt discount over the life of the debt instrument as additional non-cash interest expense utilizing the effective interest method.\nProvision for Warranty Costs. We accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement, repairs or rework of products. Our warranty policy generally provides between one and three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase. Our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized. In estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors, including the historical frequency and volume of claims, and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty. The warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs. Our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates; estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period, repair or rework expenses; and potential risks associated with our different products. The risk levels, warranty cost information, and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated, if and when, these inputs change.\nWe actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs, but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product, product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change, and as a result, we periodically introduce newer, more complex products. Depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing, actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We will record a loss when we determine information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates the loss is both probable and estimable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates, if necessary. Our policy is to expense litigation costs as incurred.\nShare-based Compensation. We have stock incentive plans under which stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors. We also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights, are recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards and stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable. The Black-Scholes model considers, among other factors, the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis. Although the Black-Scholes model is an acceptable model, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nCompensation cost associated with grants of restricted stock units are measured at fair value, which has historically been the closing price of our stock on the date of the grant.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Pursuant to the terms of the TIA, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of DigiCore (with the exception of certain excluded shares, including treasury shares) for 4.40 South African Rand per ordinary share outstanding.\nOn October 5, 2015, the transaction was completed. The total preliminary purchase price was approximately $80.0 million and included (i) cash consideration of $79.4 million for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of DigiCore and the purchase of in-the-money vested stock options held by Ctrack employees on the closing date and (ii) $0.6 million for the portion of the fair value of replacement equity awards issued to Ctrack employees that related to services performed prior to the closing date. Upon consummation of the acquisition, Ctrack became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nR.E.R. Enterprises, Inc. (DBA Feeney Wireless)\nOn March 27, 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of R.E.R. Enterprises, Inc. ( RER\u201d) and its wholly-owned subsidiary and principal operating asset, FW. The total purchase price was approximately $24.8 million and included a cash payment at closing of approximately $9.3 million, including $1.5 million which was placed into an escrow fund to serve as partial security for the indemnification obligations of RER and its former shareholders, the Company's assumption of $0.5 million in certain transaction-related expenses incurred by FW, and the future issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $15.0 million to RER's former shareholders, which would have been payable in March 2016.\nThe total consideration of $24.8 million paid by the Company for FW did not include amounts, if any, payable under an earn-out arrangement pursuant to which we may have been required to pay up to an additional $25.0 million to the former shareholders of RER contingent upon FW's achievement of certain financial targets for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (the Earn-Out Arrangement\u201d).\nOn January 5, 2016, the Company and RER amended certain payment terms related to the Company's acquisition of RER (the RER Amendment\u201d). Under the RER Amendment, the $1.5 million placed into escrow on the date of acquisition was released to RER and its former shareholders on January 8, 2016, and the $15.0 million that was payable in shares of our common stock in March 2016 will now be paid in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016. Under the RER Amendment, the Earn-Out Arrangement has been amended (the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement\u201d) as follows: (a) any amount earned under the Earn-Out Arrangement for the achievement of financial targets for the year ended December 31, 2015 will now be paid in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016 and (b) in replacement of the potential earn-out contingent upon FW's achievement of certain financial targets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, we will issue to the former shareholders of RER approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock in three equal installments over a three-year period, beginning in March 2017.\nWe recognized approximately $7.9 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the earn-out payment due to the former shareholders of RER in the form of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount earned pursuant to the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement was $14.0 million, $12.5 million of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRecent and Pending Divestitures\nModules Business\nOn April 11, 2016, we signed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Telit Technologies (Cyprus) Limited and Telit Wireless Solutions, Inc. (collectively, Telit\u201d) pursuant to which we sold, and Telit acquired, certain hardware modules and related assets (the Modules Business\u201d) for an initial purchase price of $11.0 million in cash, which included $9.0 million that was paid to us on the closing date of the transaction, $1.0 million that would be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over a two-year period in connection with the provision by us of certain transition services and $1.0 million that would be paid to us following the satisfaction of certain conditions by us, including the assignment of specified contracts and the delivery of certain certifications and approvals. We also had the potential to receive an additional cash payment of approximately $3.8 million from Telit related to their purchase of module product inventory from us, $1.0 million of which would be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over the two-year period following the closing date in connection with the provision by us of certain\ntransition services. In addition to the above, we may have been entitled to receive a subsequent earn-out payment following the closing of the transaction if certain conditions are met.\nOn September 29, 2016, we entered into a Final Resolution Letter Agreement (the Final Resolution\u201d) with Telit. Per the Final Resolution, Telit agreed to pay us $2.1 million in full satisfaction of their payment obligations under certain sections of the original purchase agreement, including all installment payments, and we agreed to ship the remainder of the hardware modules and related assets as soon as practicable. Under the Final Resolution, the aggregate purchase consideration totaled $11.7 million, which consisted of $11.3 million in cash and $0.4 million in net settled Company liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain of approximately $5.0 million in connection with the fulfillment of certain obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, as amended, which is included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a liability of $0.5 million for the fair value of the remaining hardware and related assets due to Telit, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nMiFi Business\nOn September 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d), by and among Inseego and Novatel Wireless, on the one hand, and T.C.L. Industries Holdings (H.K.) Limited and Jade Ocean Global Limited (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) on the other hand. The Purchase Agreement relates to the pending sale of our subsidiary, Novatel Wireless, which includes the Company's MiFi branded hotspots and USB modem product lines (the MiFi Business\u201d), to the Purchasers for $50.0 million in cash, subject to potential adjustment for Novatel Wireless's working capital as of the closing date. The sale may not close until all of the closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied. One of the closing conditions is the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS\u201d). CFIUS has identified national security concerns relating to our sale of the MiFi Business to the Purchasers. In early February 2017, the Company and the Purchasers voluntarily withdrew and re-filed their notice to CFIUS in order to obtain additional time to provide further information to CFIUS and explore potential mitigation measures that may allow the transaction to proceed. In early March 2017, CFIUS provided a draft mitigation agreement which, if finalized, would allow CFIUS approval to be granted. Negotiations between CFIUS and the Purchasers regarding the final terms of such mitigation agreement remain ongoing.\nIn order to facilitate our sale of Novatel Wireless, we completed an internal Reorganization in November 2016. The first step of the Reorganization was the formation of Inseego (formerly known as Vanilla Technologies, Inc.) as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Novatel Wireless. Inseego then formed Vanilla Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inseego ( Merger Sub\u201d). Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Reorganization.\nNovatel Wireless then contributed all of its assets and liabilities (other than the MiFi Business), including its equity interests in DigiCore, FW, Novatel Wireless Solutions, Inc., Enfora Comercio de Eletronicos LTDA and each of their direct and indirect subsidiaries, to Inseego.\nFinally, Merger Sub was merged with and into Novatel Wireless, with Novatel Wireless surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inseego. Upon completion of the Reorganization, each share of Novatel Wireless common stock was automatically converted into a corresponding share of Inseego common stock, having the same rights and limitations as the corresponding share of Novatel Wireless common stock that was converted. Accordingly, at such time, Novatel Wireless's former stockholders became stockholders of Inseego.\nThe purpose and effect of the Reorganization was to separate the MiFi Business from the assets and liabilities associated with the Ctrack fleet and vehicle telematics solutions and stolen vehicle recovery and FW telemetry and connectivity solutions businesses.\nBusiness Segment Reporting\nWe do not provide separate segment reporting for our various lines of business. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker, evaluates the business as a single entity and reviews financial information and makes business decisions based on the overall results of the business. As such, the Company's operations constitute a single operating segment and one reportable segment.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nNet Revenues. We believe that our future net revenues will be influenced largely by the global demand for SaaS solutions for telematics, including our Ctrack fleet management, asset tracking and monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery, and usage-based insurance platforms. Our future net revenues will also be influenced by the demand in North America for our business connectivity solutions and device management services, as well as customer acceptance of our new products that address our markets and our ability to meet customer demand. Factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following:\n \u2022 economic environment and related market conditions; \n \u2022 increased competition from other fleet and vehicle telematics solutions, as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain wireless data access or device management feature; \n \u2022 rate of change to new products; \n \u2022 product pricing; and \n \u2022 changes in technologies.  Our revenues are also significantly dependent upon the availability of materials and components used in our hardware products.\nWe anticipate introducing additional products during the next twelve months, including SaaS telematics solutions and additional service offerings. We continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders such as Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Vodafone, MTN, Telstra and Optus. Through strategic relationships, we have been able to maintain market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners, including their access to distribution resources, increased sales opportunities and market opportunities.\nOur future net revenues will also be affected by the consummation of the sale of our Modules Business and the pending sale of our MiFi Business.\nCost of Net Revenues. Cost of net revenues includes all costs associated with our contract manufacturers, distribution, fulfillment and repair services, delivery of SaaS services, warranty costs, amortization of intangible assets, royalties, operations overhead, costs associated with our cancellation of purchase orders, and costs related to outside services. Also included in cost of net revenues are costs related to inventory adjustments, including the FW and Ctrack acquisition-related amortization of the fair value of inventory, as well as any write downs for excess and obsolete inventory and abandoned product lines. Inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products, which is influenced by the factors discussed above.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Our operating costs consist of three primary categories: research and development; sales and marketing; and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and development is at the core of our ability to produce innovative, leading-edge products. These expenses consist primarily of engineers and technicians who design and test our highly complex products and the procurement of testing and certification services.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of our sales force and product-marketing professionals. In order to maintain strong sales relationships, we provide co-marketing, trade show support and product training. We are also engaged in a wide variety of activities, such as awareness and lead generation programs as well as product marketing. Other marketing initiatives include public relations, seminars and co-branding with partners.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include primarily corporate functions such as accounting, human resources, legal, administrative support, and professional fees. This category also includes the expenses needed to operate as a publicly-traded company, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, SEC filings, stock exchange fees, and investor relations expense. Although general and administrative expenses are not directly related to revenue levels, certain expenses such as legal expenses and provisions for bad debts may cause significant volatility in future general and administrative expenses.\nWe have undertaken certain restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. Restructuring charges consist primarily of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce and facility exit related costs.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review, and intend to continue to review, acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. Given our current cash position and recent losses, any additional acquisitions we make would likely involve issuing stock and/or borrowing additional funds in order to\nprovide the purchase consideration for the acquisitions. If we make any additional acquisitions, we may incur substantial expenditures in conjunction with the acquisition process and the subsequent assimilation of any acquired business, products, technologies or personnel.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.\nTable

The decrease in hardware net revenues is primarily a result of the divestiture of our Modules Business and our strategic focus on reducing the volume of our lower margin, standalone hardware sales, partially offset by the acquisition of Ctrack with its hardware net revenues.\nSaaS, Software and Services. The increase in SaaS, software and services net revenues is primarily a result of our acquisition of Ctrack with its subscription-based solutions and our strategic focus on increasing our higher margin, SaaS, software and services revenues.\nCost of net revenues. Cost of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $167.2 million, or 68.7% of net revenues, compared to $162.0 million, or 73.3% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015.\nThe following table summarizes cost of net revenues by our two product categories (in thousands):\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,879\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS, software and services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of abandoned product line\n</td> <td>11,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHardware. The decrease in hardware cost of net revenues is primarily a result of the divestiture of our Modules Business and our strategic focus on reducing the volume of our lower margin, standalone hardware sales, partially offset by the acquisition of Ctrack with its hardware cost of net revenues.\nSaaS, software and services. The increase in SaaS, software and services cost of net revenues is primarily a result of our acquisition of Ctrack with its SaaS, software and services cost of net revenues and our strategic focus on increasing our higher margin, SaaS, software and services revenues.\nImpairment of abandoned product line. The impairment of abandoned product line includes the write down of the value of certain Enfora inventory related to product lines the Company decided to abandon during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $76.3 million, or a gross margin of 31.3%, compared to $59.0 million, or a gross margin of 26.7%, for the same period in 2015. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the changes in net revenues and cost of net revenues as discussed above, as the Company sought to transition its revenue mix toward more highly profitable SaaS, software and services business.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $30.7 million, or 12.6% of net revenues, compared to $35.4 million, or 16.0% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015. Research and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of our expense reduction activities in 2016, including headcount reductions, partially offset by our acquisition of Ctrack with its research and development expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $29.8 million, or 12.2% of net revenues, compared to $20.9 million, or 9.5% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Ctrack with its sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by the release of certain marketing development fund liabilities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $52.4 million, or 21.5% of net revenues, compared to $34.5 million, or 15.6% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, including non-cash equity earn-out expense, as well as a legal settlement entered into during the year, partially offset by our cost containment initiatives and the lack of an all-employee retention bonus that was paid in 2015.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $3.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Amortization of purchased intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the amortization of intangible assets purchased through the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW.\nImpairment of purchased intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $2.6 million primarily related to the developed technologies acquired through our acquisition of FW. We did not have an impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRestructuring charges. Restructuring expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $2.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively, and predominantly consisted of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce, as well as facility exit related costs.\nNon-cash change in acquisition-related escrow. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a non-cash loss of $8.3 million related to an acquisition-related escrow account for the purchase of Ctrack due to the weakening of the South African Rand compared to the U.S. Dollar. We did not have an acquisition-related escrow account during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $15.6 million, as compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the interest expense related to the $120.0 million of 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2020 that Novatel Wireless issued on June 10, 2015 (the Novatel Wireless Notes\u201d) and includes the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million, as compared to other income, net, of $1.1 million for the same period in 2015. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to a $5.0 million gain recorded in connection with the sale of our Modules Business, partially offset by net foreign currency transaction losses, including unrealized foreign currency losses on outstanding intercompany loans that Ctrack has with certain of its subsidiaries, which are remeasured at each reporting period. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of unrealized foreign currency gains on outstanding intercompany loans that Ctrack has with certain of its subsidiaries.\nIncome tax provision. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million as compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2015.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against additional tax assets generated during the year.\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5,000 as compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $8,000 for the same period in 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet revenues. Net revenues were approximately $220.9 million during 2015, an increase of approximately $35.7 million or 19.3% compared to 2014.\nThe following table summarizes net revenues by our two product categories during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SaaS, Software and Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,291.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHardware.

The increase in SaaS, software and services cost of net revenues is primarily a result of our acquisitions of Ctrack and FW and their associated SaaS, software and services cost of net revenues.\nGross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $59.0 million, or 26.7% of net revenues, as compared to approximately $37.0 million, or 20.0% of net revenues, in 2014. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the changes in net revenues and cost of net revenues as discussed above, as the Company acquired Ctrack and FW to transition its revenue mix toward more highly profitable SaaS, software and services business revenue.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $35.4 million, or 16.0% of net revenues, compared to approximately $34.3 million, or 18.5% of net revenues, in 2014. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of our acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, partially offset by our expense reduction activities in 2015, including headcount reductions.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $20.9 million, or 9.5% of net revenues, compared to approximately $13.8 million, or 7.4% of net revenues, in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses increased as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of our acquisitions of Ctrack and FW.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $34.5 million, or 15.6% of net revenues, compared to approximately $15.4 million, or 8.3% of net revenues, in 2014.

The amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $2.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Amortization of purchased intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the amortization of intangible assets purchased through the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW for the period following their applicable dates of acquisition through December 31, 2015.\nShareholder litigation loss. The shareholder litigation loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $0.8 million and related to the In re Novatel Wireless Securities Litigation described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We did not have shareholder litigation loss for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRestructuring charges. Restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $3.8 million as compared to approximately $7.8 million for the same period in 2014. Restructuring charges predominantly consisted of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce, as well as facility exit related costs.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred a non-cash loss of $3.3 million related to the 2014 Warrant (as defined below) that we issued in connection with the financing transaction on September 8, 2014, primarily as a result of an increase in the market value of our common stock from September 8, 2014 to November 17, 2014, the date the 2014 Warrant was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as it was no longer deemed a liability. We did not have a warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.2 million as compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the interest expense related to the Novatel Wireless Notes and includes the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.1 million as compared to other expense, net, of $0.2 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in other income, net, is primarily a result of unrealized foreign currency gains on outstanding intercompany loans that Ctrack has with certain of its subsidiaries, partially offset by the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during the period.\nIncome tax provision. Income tax expense was approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2014.\nRecognition of beneficial conversion feature. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized the fair value of an embedded beneficial conversion feature for $0.4 million on the convertible Series C preferred shares issued in connection with the financing transaction that closed on September 8, 2014. We did not have an embedded beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nFinancing Transaction\nOn September 3, 2014, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with HC2 Holdings 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Investor\u201d), pursuant to which, on September 8, 2014, we sold to the Investor (i) 7,363,334 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, (ii) a warrant to purchase 4,117,647 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.26 per share (the 2014 Warrant\u201d) and (iii) 87,196 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock, all at a purchase price of (a) $1.75 per share of common stock plus, in each case, the related 2014 Warrant and (b) $17.50 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $14.4 million. On November 17, 2014, each share of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding automatically converted into ten shares of common stock.\nOn March 26, 2015, the Investor exercised a portion of the 2014 Warrant to purchase 3,824,600 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.26 per share for total proceeds of $8.6 million.\nOn March 26, 2015, in order to induce the Investor to exercise the 2014 Warrant for cash in connection with the acquisition of FW, we issued to the Investor a new warrant to purchase 1,593,583 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn October 31, 2014, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, NA (the Revolver\u201d) in the amount of $25.0 million. Concurrently with the acquisition of FW, we amended the Revolver to include FW as a borrower and Loan Party, as defined by the agreement. On November 17, 2015, the Revolver was amended to increase the\nmaximum borrowing capacity to $48.0 million. The amount of borrowings that may be made under the Revolver are based on a borrowing base and are comprised of a specified percentage of eligible receivables. If, at any time during the term of the Revolver, the amount of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver exceeds the borrowing base then in effect, we would be required to repay such borrowings in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. The Revolver includes $3.0 million available for letters of credit, $0.7 million of which was available for letters of credit at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolver and we had available borrowings of approximately $4.7 million.\nOn March 20, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Revolver was amended (the Amendment\u201d). The Amendment, made at the Company's request, amended and updated the financial covenants with respect to liquidity requirements and EBITDA targets, among other things, in order to enable draw-downs by the Company from time to time. In exchange for such accommodations, the Amendment also decreased the aggregate amount available under the Revolver from $48.0 million to $10.0 million and increased the applicable margin to 4.00% when interest is based on the daily three month LIBOR rate and 1.5% when interest is based on the prime rate.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn June 10, 2015, Novatel Wireless issued $120.0 million of the Novatel Wireless Notes, which are governed by the terms of the Novatel Wireless Indenture among Novatel Wireless, as issuer, Inseego and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, as amended by certain supplemental indentures. The Novatel Wireless Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Novatel Wireless and bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015. The Novatel Wireless Notes will mature on June 15, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Novatel Wireless Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election, at an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share of our common stock.\nOn January 9, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, in connection with the settlement of an exchange offer and consent solicitation with respect to the Novatel Wireless Notes, the Company issued $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the Inseego Notes\u201d). The Inseego Notes were issued in exchange for the $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Novatel Wireless Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange and subsequently canceled.\nAs of the filing date of this report, the following aggregate principal amounts remain outstanding (in thousands):\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inseego Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Novatel Wireless Notes\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDigiCore Mortgage Bond\nDigiCore has a mortgage bond with Absa Bank Limited in South Africa ( Absa\u201d) that is secured by certain property of DigiCore. The mortgage bond has a ten year term, expiring in December 2018, and bears interest at the South Africa prime rate minus 1.75% (8.75% at December 31, 2016). At December 31, 2016, $0.6 million remained outstanding under the mortgage bond.\nDigiCore Secured Banking Facility\nDigiCore has a secured banking facility with Absa, which had a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.7 million at December 31, 2016. The facility bears interest at the South Africa prime interest rate less 0.10% (10.40% at December 31, 2016) and is subject to renewal annually in April. At December 31, 2016, $1.7 million remained outstanding under this facility.\nDigiCore Secured Overdraft Facility\nDigiCore has a secured overdraft facility with Grindrod Bank in South Africa, which had a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.5 million at December 31, 2016. The facility bears interest at the South Africa prime interest rate plus 1.00% (11.50% at December 31, 2016), requires monthly interest and, in certain instances, minimum principal payments. The facility is subject to renewal annually in September. At December 31, 2016, $1.5 million remained outstanding under this facility.\nRER Amendment\nPursuant to the RER Amendment, we are obligated to pay a total of $15.0 million in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016. We are also obligated to pay a total of approximately $6.1 million in cash over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016, related to the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement. As of the filing date of this report, the March 2017 cash installment has not been paid.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Revolver, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from the completion of the pending sale of the MiFi Business, will be sufficient to meet these obligations. While our management believes that it is probable that the sale of the MiFi Business will be completed, see Other Liquidity Needs\u201d below for discussion of management's plans if the sale of the MiFi Business is not completed as expected.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,579\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>5,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97,087\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(1,291\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(2,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>12,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $26.9 million for the same period in 2015. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the net losses incurred during the period, partially offset by non-cash charges related to the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, depreciation and amortization, including that of the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the impairment of certain product lines the Company decided to abandon and certain purchased intangible assets, the reversal of certain market development fund accruals and share-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to net losses in the period and the unfavorable working capital impacts, partially offset by non-cash charges related to the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.0 million compared to $97.1 million used in investing activities for the same period in 2015. Cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of our Modules Business, partially offset by payments made pursuant to the RER Amendment and additions to capitalized software development costs. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to our acquisitions of Ctrack and FW.\nFinancing activities. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $119.2 million for the same period in 2015. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to net repayments of DigiCore bank facilities and capital lease obligations, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to gross proceeds from the issuance of the Novatel Wireless Notes and the exercise of the 2014 Warrant, partially offset by the payment of issuance costs related to the Novatel Wireless Notes, net repayments on our Revolver and the payoff of the FW assumed credit line and certain capital lease obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016, and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>> 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Novatel Wireless Notes(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DigiCore mortgage bond(2)\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DigiCore bank facilities(2)\n</td> <td>3,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RER Amendment and Amended Earn-Out Arrangement\n</td> <td>15,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>1,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>7,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the outstanding borrowings and contractually required interest payments to Novatel Wireless Note holders at December 31, 2016, assuming no repurchases or conversions of the Novatel Wireless Notes prior to June 15, 2020, the maturity date. On January 9, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company issued $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of Inseego Notes in exchange for the $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Novatel Wireless Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange and subsequently canceled. \n (2) Assumes applicable foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2016 remain unchanged.  Other Liquidity Needs\nWe have recently incurred operating losses and had a net loss of $60.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.9 million, working capital of $6.1 million and available borrowings under the Revolver of approximately $4.7 million.\nOur ability to transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. If events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required to reduce planned research and development activities, incur additional restructuring charges or reduce other operating expenses which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Revolver, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from the completion of the pending sale of the MiFi Business, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months following the filing date of this report.\nOur historical operating results, primarily those related to the MiFi Business, indicate that substantial doubt exists related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that the closing of the sale of the MiFi Business is probable of occurring and mitigating the substantial doubt raised by our historical operating results and will satisfy our estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months following the filing date of this report. In the unlikely event that the sale of the MiFi Business does not close, we would require an alternative source of financing in order to divest the MiFi Business elsewhere or to otherwise streamline the MiFi Business as may be needed. In order to obtain such alternative financing, we must comply with certain requirements under the Revolver and the Inseego Indenture. We have had discussions with potential financing sources, and we believe that it is probable that such financing would be available to the Company based on terms that have been presented to the Company by financial sources.\nWe cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of the sale of the MiFi Business or any other activities to generate liquidity, including the availability of additional financing. If we are not able to generate additional liquidity through the mechanisms described above or through some combination of other actions, while not expected, we may not be able to access funds under our Revolver, and we may need to secure additional sources of funds, which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to production, inventory or services that are important to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations, a material failure to satisfy our contractual commitments or a failure to generate revenue from new or existing products.\nWe may also raise additional funds to accelerate development of new and existing services and products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. There can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, in order to obtain additional borrowings, we must comply with certain requirements under the Revolver and the Inseego Indenture. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interests and securities\nissued may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities, we may be subject to certain limitations on our operations. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our results of operations, financial conditions or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenues from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators, OEM customers and value added resellers and distributors. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of asset-management solutions utilizing wireless technology and M2M communication devices to transportation and industrial companies, medical device manufacturers and security system providers. Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon the later of transfer of title or delivery of the product to the customer. Where the transfer of title or risk of loss is contingent on the customer's acceptance of the product, we will not recognize revenue until both title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. We recognize revenues from SaaS services pro-rata over the contract term. We record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of when revenue recognition criteria are met. We have granted price protection to certain customers in accordance with the provisions of the respective contracts and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions. We estimate the amount of price protection for current period product sales utilizing historical experience and information regarding customer inventory levels. To date, we have not incurred material price protection obligations. Revenues from sales to certain customers are subject to cooperative advertising allowances. Cooperative advertising allowances are recorded as an operating expense to the extent that the advertising benefit is separable from the revenue transaction and the fair value of that advertising benefit is determinable. To the extent that such allowances either do not provide a separable benefit to us, or the fair value of the advertising benefit cannot be reliably estimated, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized. In estimating future product returns, we consider various factors, including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends.\nWe record our hardware revenue associated with the agreed upon price on hardware sales, and accrue any estimated costs of post-delivery performance obligations, such as warranty obligations. We consider the four basic revenue recognition criteria discussed under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 when assessing appropriate revenue recognition as follows:\nCriterion #1 - Persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist;\nCriterion #2 - Delivery has occurred;\nCriterion #3 - Our price to the buyer must be fixed or determinable; and,\nCriterion #4 - Collectability is reasonably assured.\nFor multiple element arrangements, total consideration received from customers is allocated to the elements. This may include hardware, non-essential software elements and/or essential software, based on a relative selling price. The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendors specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), (ii) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), and (iii) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d). Because we have neither VSOE nor TPE, revenue has been based on our BESP. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of the sale provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Amounts allocated to other deliverables based upon BESP are recognized in the period the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur process for determining BESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Our prices are determined based upon cost to produce our products, expected order quantities and acceptance in the marketplace. In addition, when developing BESPs for products, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives (if they exist) and product-specific business objectives.\nWe account for multiple element arrangements that primarily consist of software licenses and post contract support ( PCS\u201d) by recognizing revenue for such arrangements ratably over the term of the PCS as we have not established VSOE for the PCS element.\nWe provide SaaS subscriptions for our fleet and vehicle management solutions in which customers are provided with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile assets via software applications hosted by us. The customer has the option to purchase the monitoring device or lease it over the term of the contract. If the customer purchases the monitoring device, we recognize the revenue at the time of purchase. If the customer chooses to lease the monitoring device, we recognize the revenue for the monitoring device over the term of the contract. The Company records such revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 840, Leases, as we have determined that they qualify as operating leases. We recognize revenues from SaaS services over the term of the contract.\nCertain of our revenue is based on contractual arrangements. In such instances, management considers the nature of the Company's contractual arrangements in determining whether to recognize certain types of revenue on the basis of the gross amount billed or net amount retained after payments are made to providers of certain services related to the product or service offering. The main factors we use to determine whether to record revenue on a gross or net basis are whether:\n \u2022 we are primarily responsible for the service to the customer; \n \u2022 we have discretion in establishing fees paid by the customer; and \n \u2022 we are involved in the determination of product or service specifications.  When the customer's fee includes a portion of charges that are paid to another party and we are primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis in an amount equal to the fee paid by the customer. The cost of revenues recognized is the amount due to the other party and is recorded as cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. In instances in which another party is primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer, revenue is recognized in the net amount retained by the Company. The portion of the fees that we collect from the customer and remit to the other party are considered pass through amounts and accordingly are not a component of net revenues or cost of net revenues.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers' inability to pay. We determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions, historical losses, and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers' credit-worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, we review our customers' credit-worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services, our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers' industries. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nProvision for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Write-downs in inventory value or losses on inventory purchase commitments depend on various items, including factors related to customer demand, economic and competitive conditions, technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Whenever inventory is written down, a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve.\nWe believe that, when made, the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory. If customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates, inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisitions. When acquiring companies, we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support liabilities assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience, market data and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets the Company has acquired include but are not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from customer relationships; (ii) estimates to develop or use technology; and (iii) discount rates.\nIf management determines that a pre-acquisition contingency is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date, we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary fair value allocation. We continue to gather information for and evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, such amounts will be included in the fair value allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of operations.\nWe may be required to pay future consideration to the former shareholders of acquired companies, depending on the terms of the applicable purchase agreements, which may be contingent upon the achievement of certain financial and operating targets, as well as the retention of key employees. If the future consideration is considered to be compensation, amounts will be expensed when incurred.\nPurchased Intangible Assets. In determining the fair value allocation for our acquisitions, we considered, among other factors, our intended uses of the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for the acquired company's products and services. The estimated fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach. The income approach relies on an estimation of the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owner of an asset during its remaining economic life. This approach requires a projection of the cash flow that the asset is expected to generate in the future. The projected cash flow is discounted to its present value using a rate of return, or discount rate that accounts for the time value of money and the degree of risks inherent in the asset. The expected future cash flow that is projected should include all of the economic benefits attributable to the asset, including the tax savings associated with the amortization of the intangible asset value over the tax life of the asset. The income approach may take the form of a relief from royalty\u201d methodology, a cost savings methodology, a with and without\u201d methodology, or excess earnings methodology, depending on the specific asset under consideration.\nLong-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of the unamortized balances of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, rental assets and intangible assets, which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. We consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry or economic trends.\nOur assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to their associated undiscounted expected future cash flows, which are determined using an expected cash flow model. This model requires estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital and other relevant factors. We estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and other industry data. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThe timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long-lived assets below their carrying value. We monitor our long-lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present. We believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value long-lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management. The majority of our long-lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over approximately two to ten years. As most of these assets are associated with technology or trade conditions that may change rapidly; such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis.\nValuation of Goodwill. Our goodwill resulted from our acquisitions of FW and Ctrack during 2015. In accordance with the ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we will review goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value.\nConvertible Debt. We account for convertible debt instruments that are settleable in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) by separating the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects our\nnonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We determine the carrying amount of the liability component by measuring the fair value of similar debt instruments that do not have the conversion feature. If a similar debt instrument does not exist, we estimate the fair value by using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing a debt instrument, including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities. Determining the fair value of the debt component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the debt component and the associated non-cash interest expense.\nUpon issuance, we assign a value to the debt component equal to the estimated fair value of similar debt instruments without the conversion feature, which could result in our recording the debt instrument at a discount. If the debt instrument is recorded at a discount, we amortize the debt discount over the life of the debt instrument as additional non-cash interest expense utilizing the effective interest method.\nProvision for Warranty Costs. We accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement, repairs or rework of products. Our warranty policy generally provides between one and three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase. Our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized. In estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors, including the historical frequency and volume of claims, and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty. The warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs. Our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates; estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period, repair or rework expenses; and potential risks associated with our different products. The risk levels, warranty cost information, and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated, if and when, these inputs change.\nWe actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs, but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product, product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change, and as a result, we periodically introduce newer, more complex products. Depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing, actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We will record a loss when we determine information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates the loss is both probable and estimable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates, if necessary. Our policy is to expense litigation costs as incurred.\nShare-based Compensation. We have stock incentive plans under which stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors. We also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights, are recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards and stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable. The Black-Scholes model considers, among other factors, the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis. Although the Black-Scholes model is an acceptable model, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nCompensation cost associated with grants of restricted stock units are measured at fair value, which has historically been the closing price of our stock on the date of the grant.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Ctrack uses leading cellular providers such as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Vodafone, MTN, Telstra and Optus to ensure the optimal real-time visibility of tracked vehicles and systems, supported by accurate and sophisticated mapping services such as the HERE Open Location Platform.\nThe hardware used in our solutions is produced by contract manufacturers. Their services include component procurement, assembly, testing, quality control and fulfillment. Our contract manufacturers include Inventec Appliances\nCorporation and AsiaTelco Technologies Co. Under our manufacturing agreements, contract manufacturers provide us with services including component procurement, product manufacturing, final assembly, testing, quality control and fulfillment.\nMerger, Acquisition and Divestiture Activities\nAcquisitions\nDigiCore Holdings Limited (DBA Ctrack)\nOn June 18, 2015, we entered into a transaction implementation agreement (the TIA\u201d) with DigiCore. Pursuant to the terms of the TIA, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of DigiCore (with the exception of certain excluded shares, including treasury shares) for 4.40 South African Rand per ordinary share outstanding.\nOn October 5, 2015, the transaction was completed. The total preliminary purchase price was approximately $80.0 million and included (i) cash consideration of $79.4 million for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of DigiCore and the purchase of in-the-money vested stock options held by Ctrack employees on the closing date and (ii) $0.6 million for the portion of the fair value of replacement equity awards issued to Ctrack employees that related to services performed prior to the closing date. Upon consummation of the acquisition, Ctrack became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nR.E.R. Enterprises, Inc. (DBA Feeney Wireless)\nOn March 27, 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of R.E.R. Enterprises, Inc. ( RER\u201d) and its wholly-owned subsidiary and principal operating asset, FW. The total purchase price was approximately $24.8 million and included a cash payment at closing of approximately $9.3 million, including $1.5 million which was placed into an escrow fund to serve as partial security for the indemnification obligations of RER and its former shareholders, the Company's assumption of $0.5 million in certain transaction-related expenses incurred by FW, and the future issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $15.0 million to RER's former shareholders, which would have been payable in March 2016.\nThe total consideration of $24.8 million paid by the Company for FW did not include amounts, if any, payable under an earn-out arrangement pursuant to which we may have been required to pay up to an additional $25.0 million to the former shareholders of RER contingent upon FW's achievement of certain financial targets for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (the Earn-Out Arrangement\u201d).\nOn January 5, 2016, the Company and RER amended certain payment terms related to the Company's acquisition of RER (the RER Amendment\u201d). Under the RER Amendment, the $1.5 million placed into escrow on the date of acquisition was released to RER and its former shareholders on January 8, 2016, and the $15.0 million that was payable in shares of our common stock in March 2016 will now be paid in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016. Under the RER Amendment, the Earn-Out Arrangement has been amended (the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement\u201d) as follows: (a) any amount earned under the Earn-Out Arrangement for the achievement of financial targets for the year ended December 31, 2015 will now be paid in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016 and (b) in replacement of the potential earn-out contingent upon FW's achievement of certain financial targets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, we will issue to the former shareholders of RER approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock in three equal installments over a three-year period, beginning in March 2017.\nWe recognized approximately $7.9 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the earn-out payment due to the former shareholders of RER in the form of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount earned pursuant to the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement was $14.0 million, $12.5 million of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRecent and Pending Divestitures\nModules Business\nOn April 11, 2016, we signed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Telit Technologies (Cyprus) Limited and Telit Wireless Solutions, Inc. (collectively, Telit\u201d) pursuant to which we sold, and Telit acquired, certain hardware modules and related assets (the Modules Business\u201d) for an initial purchase price of $11.0 million in cash, which included $9.0 million that was paid to us on the closing date of the transaction, $1.0 million that would be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over a two-year period in connection with the provision by us of certain transition services and $1.0 million that would be paid to us following the satisfaction of certain conditions by us, including the assignment of specified contracts and the delivery of certain certifications and approvals. We also had the potential to receive an additional cash payment of approximately $3.8 million from Telit related to their purchase of module product inventory from us, $1.0 million of which would be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over the two-year period following the closing date in connection with the provision by us of certain\ntransition services. In addition to the above, we may have been entitled to receive a subsequent earn-out payment following the closing of the transaction if certain conditions are met.\nOn September 29, 2016, we entered into a Final Resolution Letter Agreement (the Final Resolution\u201d) with Telit. Per the Final Resolution, Telit agreed to pay us $2.1 million in full satisfaction of their payment obligations under certain sections of the original purchase agreement, including all installment payments, and we agreed to ship the remainder of the hardware modules and related assets as soon as practicable. Under the Final Resolution, the aggregate purchase consideration totaled $11.7 million, which consisted of $11.3 million in cash and $0.4 million in net settled Company liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain of approximately $5.0 million in connection with the fulfillment of certain obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, as amended, which is included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a liability of $0.5 million for the fair value of the remaining hardware and related assets due to Telit, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nMiFi Business\nOn September 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d), by and among Inseego and Novatel Wireless, on the one hand, and T.C.L. Industries Holdings (H.K.) Limited and Jade Ocean Global Limited (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) on the other hand. The Purchase Agreement relates to the pending sale of our subsidiary, Novatel Wireless, which includes the Company's MiFi branded hotspots and USB modem product lines (the MiFi Business\u201d), to the Purchasers for $50.0 million in cash, subject to potential adjustment for Novatel Wireless's working capital as of the closing date. The sale may not close until all of the closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied. One of the closing conditions is the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS\u201d). CFIUS has identified national security concerns relating to our sale of the MiFi Business to the Purchasers. In early February 2017, the Company and the Purchasers voluntarily withdrew and re-filed their notice to CFIUS in order to obtain additional time to provide further information to CFIUS and explore potential mitigation measures that may allow the transaction to proceed. In early March 2017, CFIUS provided a draft mitigation agreement which, if finalized, would allow CFIUS approval to be granted. Negotiations between CFIUS and the Purchasers regarding the final terms of such mitigation agreement remain ongoing.\nIn order to facilitate our sale of Novatel Wireless, we completed an internal Reorganization in November 2016. The first step of the Reorganization was the formation of Inseego (formerly known as Vanilla Technologies, Inc.) as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Novatel Wireless. Inseego then formed Vanilla Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inseego ( Merger Sub\u201d). Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Reorganization.\nNovatel Wireless then contributed all of its assets and liabilities (other than the MiFi Business), including its equity interests in DigiCore, FW, Novatel Wireless Solutions, Inc., Enfora Comercio de Eletronicos LTDA and each of their direct and indirect subsidiaries, to Inseego.\nFinally, Merger Sub was merged with and into Novatel Wireless, with Novatel Wireless surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inseego. Upon completion of the Reorganization, each share of Novatel Wireless common stock was automatically converted into a corresponding share of Inseego common stock, having the same rights and limitations as the corresponding share of Novatel Wireless common stock that was converted. Accordingly, at such time, Novatel Wireless's former stockholders became stockholders of Inseego.\nThe purpose and effect of the Reorganization was to separate the MiFi Business from the assets and liabilities associated with the Ctrack fleet and vehicle telematics solutions and stolen vehicle recovery and FW telemetry and connectivity solutions businesses.\nBusiness Segment Reporting\nWe do not provide separate segment reporting for our various lines of business. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker, evaluates the business as a single entity and reviews financial information and makes business decisions based on the overall results of the business. As such, the Company's operations constitute a single operating segment and one reportable segment.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nNet Revenues. We believe that our future net revenues will be influenced largely by the global demand for SaaS solutions for telematics, including our Ctrack fleet management, asset tracking and monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery, and usage-based insurance platforms. Our future net revenues will also be influenced by the demand in North America for our business connectivity solutions and device management services, as well as customer acceptance of our new products that address our markets and our ability to meet customer demand. Factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following:\n \u2022 economic environment and related market conditions; \n \u2022 increased competition from other fleet and vehicle telematics solutions, as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain wireless data access or device management feature; \n \u2022 rate of change to new products; \n \u2022 product pricing; and \n \u2022 changes in technologies.  Our revenues are also significantly dependent upon the availability of materials and components used in our hardware products.\nWe anticipate introducing additional products during the next twelve months, including SaaS telematics solutions and additional service offerings. We continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders such as Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Vodafone, MTN, Telstra and Optus. Through strategic relationships, we have been able to maintain market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners, including their access to distribution resources, increased sales opportunities and market opportunities.\nOur future net revenues will also be affected by the consummation of the sale of our Modules Business and the pending sale of our MiFi Business.\nCost of Net Revenues. Cost of net revenues includes all costs associated with our contract manufacturers, distribution, fulfillment and repair services, delivery of SaaS services, warranty costs, amortization of intangible assets, royalties, operations overhead, costs associated with our cancellation of purchase orders, and costs related to outside services. Also included in cost of net revenues are costs related to inventory adjustments, including the FW and Ctrack acquisition-related amortization of the fair value of inventory, as well as any write downs for excess and obsolete inventory and abandoned product lines. Inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products, which is influenced by the factors discussed above.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Our operating costs consist of three primary categories: research and development; sales and marketing; and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and development is at the core of our ability to produce innovative, leading-edge products. These expenses consist primarily of engineers and technicians who design and test our highly complex products and the procurement of testing and certification services.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of our sales force and product-marketing professionals. In order to maintain strong sales relationships, we provide co-marketing, trade show support and product training. We are also engaged in a wide variety of activities, such as awareness and lead generation programs as well as product marketing. Other marketing initiatives include public relations, seminars and co-branding with partners.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include primarily corporate functions such as accounting, human resources, legal, administrative support, and professional fees. This category also includes the expenses needed to operate as a publicly-traded company, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, SEC filings, stock exchange fees, and investor relations expense. Although general and administrative expenses are not directly related to revenue levels, certain expenses such as legal expenses and provisions for bad debts may cause significant volatility in future general and administrative expenses.\nWe have undertaken certain restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. Restructuring charges consist primarily of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce and facility exit related costs.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review, and intend to continue to review, acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. Given our current cash position and recent losses, any additional acquisitions we make would likely involve issuing stock and/or borrowing additional funds in order to\nprovide the purchase consideration for the acquisitions. If we make any additional acquisitions, we may incur substantial expenditures in conjunction with the acquisition process and the subsequent assimilation of any acquired business, products, technologies or personnel.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $243.6 million, an increase of $22.6 million, or 10.2%, compared to the same period in 2015.\nThe following table summarizes net revenues by our two product categories (in thousands):\n\nHardware. The decrease in hardware net revenues is primarily a result of the divestiture of our Modules Business and our strategic focus on reducing the volume of our lower margin, standalone hardware sales, partially offset by the acquisition of Ctrack with its hardware net revenues.\nSaaS, Software and Services. The increase in SaaS, software and services net revenues is primarily a result of our acquisition of Ctrack with its subscription-based solutions and our strategic focus on increasing our higher margin, SaaS, software and services revenues.\nCost of net revenues. Cost of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $167.2 million, or 68.7% of net revenues, compared to $162.0 million, or 73.3% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015.\nThe following table summarizes cost of net revenues by our two product categories (in thousands):\n\nHardware. The decrease in hardware cost of net revenues is primarily a result of the divestiture of our Modules Business and our strategic focus on reducing the volume of our lower margin, standalone hardware sales, partially offset by the acquisition of Ctrack with its hardware cost of net revenues.\nSaaS, software and services. The increase in SaaS, software and services cost of net revenues is primarily a result of our acquisition of Ctrack with its SaaS, software and services cost of net revenues and our strategic focus on increasing our higher margin, SaaS, software and services revenues.\nImpairment of abandoned product line. The impairment of abandoned product line includes the write down of the value of certain Enfora inventory related to product lines the Company decided to abandon during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $76.3 million, or a gross margin of 31.3%, compared to $59.0 million, or a gross margin of 26.7%, for the same period in 2015. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the changes in net revenues and cost of net revenues as discussed above, as the Company sought to transition its revenue mix toward more highly profitable SaaS, software and services business.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $30.7 million, or 12.6% of net revenues, compared to $35.4 million, or 16.0% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015. Research and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of our expense reduction activities in 2016, including headcount reductions, partially offset by our acquisition of Ctrack with its research and development expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $29.8 million, or 12.2% of net revenues, compared to $20.9 million, or 9.5% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Ctrack with its sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by the release of certain marketing development fund liabilities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $52.4 million, or 21.5% of net revenues, compared to $34.5 million, or 15.6% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, including non-cash equity earn-out expense, as well as a legal settlement entered into during the year, partially offset by our cost containment initiatives and the lack of an all-employee retention bonus that was paid in 2015.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $3.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Amortization of purchased intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the amortization of intangible assets purchased through the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW.\nImpairment of purchased intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $2.6 million primarily related to the developed technologies acquired through our acquisition of FW. We did not have an impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRestructuring charges. Restructuring expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $2.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively, and predominantly consisted of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce, as well as facility exit related costs.\nNon-cash change in acquisition-related escrow. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a non-cash loss of $8.3 million related to an acquisition-related escrow account for the purchase of Ctrack due to the weakening of the South African Rand compared to the U.S. Dollar. We did not have an acquisition-related escrow account during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $15.6 million, as compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the interest expense related to the $120.0 million of 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2020 that Novatel Wireless issued on June 10, 2015 (the Novatel Wireless Notes\u201d) and includes the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million, as compared to other income, net, of $1.1 million for the same period in 2015. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to a $5.0 million gain recorded in connection with the sale of our Modules Business, partially offset by net foreign currency transaction losses, including unrealized foreign currency losses on outstanding intercompany loans that Ctrack has with certain of its subsidiaries, which are remeasured at each reporting period. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of unrealized foreign currency gains on outstanding intercompany loans that Ctrack has with certain of its subsidiaries.\nIncome tax provision. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million as compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2015.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against additional tax assets generated during the year.\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5,000 as compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $8,000 for the same period in 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet revenues. Net revenues were approximately $220.9 million during 2015, an increase of approximately $35.7 million or 19.3% compared to 2014.\nThe following table summarizes net revenues by our two product categories during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nHardware. The increase in hardware net revenues is primarily a result of the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW and their associated hardware net revenues.\nSaaS, software and services.

The increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the changes in net revenues and cost of net revenues as discussed above, as the Company acquired Ctrack and FW to transition its revenue mix toward more highly profitable SaaS, software and services business revenue.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $35.4 million, or 16.0% of net revenues, compared to approximately $34.3 million, or 18.5% of net revenues, in 2014. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of our acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, partially offset by our expense reduction activities in 2015, including headcount reductions.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $20.9 million, or 9.5% of net revenues, compared to approximately $13.8 million, or 7.4% of net revenues, in 2014.

The shareholder litigation loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $0.8 million and related to the In re Novatel Wireless Securities Litigation described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We did not have shareholder litigation loss for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRestructuring charges. Restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $3.8 million as compared to approximately $7.8 million for the same period in 2014. Restructuring charges predominantly consisted of severance costs incurred in connection with the reduction of our workforce, as well as facility exit related costs.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred a non-cash loss of $3.3 million related to the 2014 Warrant (as defined below) that we issued in connection with the financing transaction on September 8, 2014, primarily as a result of an increase in the market value of our common stock from September 8, 2014 to November 17, 2014, the date the 2014 Warrant was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as it was no longer deemed a liability. We did not have a warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.2 million as compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the interest expense related to the Novatel Wireless Notes and includes the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.1 million as compared to other expense, net, of $0.2 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in other income, net, is primarily a result of unrealized foreign currency gains on outstanding intercompany loans that Ctrack has with certain of its subsidiaries, partially offset by the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during the period.\nIncome tax provision. Income tax expense was approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2014.\nRecognition of beneficial conversion feature. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized the fair value of an embedded beneficial conversion feature for $0.4 million on the convertible Series C preferred shares issued in connection with the financing transaction that closed on September 8, 2014. We did not have an embedded beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nFinancing Transaction\nOn September 3, 2014, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with HC2 Holdings 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Investor\u201d), pursuant to which, on September 8, 2014, we sold to the Investor (i) 7,363,334 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, (ii) a warrant to purchase 4,117,647 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.26 per share (the 2014 Warrant\u201d) and (iii) 87,196 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock, all at a purchase price of (a) $1.75 per share of common stock plus, in each case, the related 2014 Warrant and (b) $17.50 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $14.4 million. On November 17, 2014, each share of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding automatically converted into ten shares of common stock.\nOn March 26, 2015, the Investor exercised a portion of the 2014 Warrant to purchase 3,824,600 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.26 per share for total proceeds of $8.6 million.\nOn March 26, 2015, in order to induce the Investor to exercise the 2014 Warrant for cash in connection with the acquisition of FW, we issued to the Investor a new warrant to purchase 1,593,583 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn October 31, 2014, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, NA (the Revolver\u201d) in the amount of $25.0 million. Concurrently with the acquisition of FW, we amended the Revolver to include FW as a borrower and Loan Party, as defined by the agreement. On November 17, 2015, the Revolver was amended to increase the\nmaximum borrowing capacity to $48.0 million. The amount of borrowings that may be made under the Revolver are based on a borrowing base and are comprised of a specified percentage of eligible receivables. If, at any time during the term of the Revolver, the amount of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver exceeds the borrowing base then in effect, we would be required to repay such borrowings in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. The Revolver includes $3.0 million available for letters of credit, $0.7 million of which was available for letters of credit at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolver and we had available borrowings of approximately $4.7 million.\nOn March 20, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Revolver was amended (the Amendment\u201d). The Amendment, made at the Company's request, amended and updated the financial covenants with respect to liquidity requirements and EBITDA targets, among other things, in order to enable draw-downs by the Company from time to time. In exchange for such accommodations, the Amendment also decreased the aggregate amount available under the Revolver from $48.0 million to $10.0 million and increased the applicable margin to 4.00% when interest is based on the daily three month LIBOR rate and 1.5% when interest is based on the prime rate.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn June 10, 2015, Novatel Wireless issued $120.0 million of the Novatel Wireless Notes, which are governed by the terms of the Novatel Wireless Indenture among Novatel Wireless, as issuer, Inseego and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, as amended by certain supplemental indentures. The Novatel Wireless Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Novatel Wireless and bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015. The Novatel Wireless Notes will mature on June 15, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Novatel Wireless Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election, at an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share of our common stock.\nOn January 9, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, in connection with the settlement of an exchange offer and consent solicitation with respect to the Novatel Wireless Notes, the Company issued $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the Inseego Notes\u201d). The Inseego Notes were issued in exchange for the $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Novatel Wireless Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange and subsequently canceled.\nAs of the filing date of this report, the following aggregate principal amounts remain outstanding (in thousands):\n\nDigiCore Mortgage Bond\nDigiCore has a mortgage bond with Absa Bank Limited in South Africa ( Absa\u201d) that is secured by certain property of DigiCore. The mortgage bond has a ten year term, expiring in December 2018, and bears interest at the South Africa prime rate minus 1.75% (8.75% at December 31, 2016). At December 31, 2016, $0.6 million remained outstanding under the mortgage bond.\nDigiCore Secured Banking Facility\nDigiCore has a secured banking facility with Absa, which had a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.7 million at December 31, 2016. The facility bears interest at the South Africa prime interest rate less 0.10% (10.40% at December 31, 2016) and is subject to renewal annually in April. At December 31, 2016, $1.7 million remained outstanding under this facility.\nDigiCore Secured Overdraft Facility\nDigiCore has a secured overdraft facility with Grindrod Bank in South Africa, which had a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.5 million at December 31, 2016. The facility bears interest at the South Africa prime interest rate plus 1.00% (11.50% at December 31, 2016), requires monthly interest and, in certain instances, minimum principal payments. The facility is subject to renewal annually in September. At December 31, 2016, $1.5 million remained outstanding under this facility.\nRER Amendment\nPursuant to the RER Amendment, we are obligated to pay a total of $15.0 million in five cash installments over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016. We are also obligated to pay a total of approximately $6.1 million in cash over a four-year period, beginning in March 2016, related to the Amended Earn-Out Arrangement. As of the filing date of this report, the March 2017 cash installment has not been paid.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Revolver, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from the completion of the pending sale of the MiFi Business, will be sufficient to meet these obligations. While our management believes that it is probable that the sale of the MiFi Business will be completed, see Other Liquidity Needs\u201d below for discussion of management's plans if the sale of the MiFi Business is not completed as expected.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $26.9 million for the same period in 2015. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the net losses incurred during the period, partially offset by non-cash charges related to the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, depreciation and amortization, including that of the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the impairment of certain product lines the Company decided to abandon and certain purchased intangible assets, the reversal of certain market development fund accruals and share-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to net losses in the period and the unfavorable working capital impacts, partially offset by non-cash charges related to the acquisitions of Ctrack and FW, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.0 million compared to $97.1 million used in investing activities for the same period in 2015. Cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of our Modules Business, partially offset by payments made pursuant to the RER Amendment and additions to capitalized software development costs. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to our acquisitions of Ctrack and FW.\nFinancing activities. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $119.2 million for the same period in 2015. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to net repayments of DigiCore bank facilities and capital lease obligations, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to gross proceeds from the issuance of the Novatel Wireless Notes and the exercise of the 2014 Warrant, partially offset by the payment of issuance costs related to the Novatel Wireless Notes, net repayments on our Revolver and the payoff of the FW assumed credit line and certain capital lease obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016, and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\n\n (1) Represents the outstanding borrowings and contractually required interest payments to Novatel Wireless Note holders at December 31, 2016, assuming no repurchases or conversions of the Novatel Wireless Notes prior to June 15, 2020, the maturity date. On January 9, 2017, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company issued $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of Inseego Notes in exchange for the $119.8 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Novatel Wireless Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange and subsequently canceled. \n (2) Assumes applicable foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2016 remain unchanged.  Other Liquidity Needs\nWe have recently incurred operating losses and had a net loss of $60.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.9 million, working capital of $6.1 million and available borrowings under the Revolver of approximately $4.7 million.\nOur ability to transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. If events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required to reduce planned research and development activities, incur additional restructuring charges or reduce other operating expenses which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Revolver, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from the completion of the pending sale of the MiFi Business, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months following the filing date of this report.\nOur historical operating results, primarily those related to the MiFi Business, indicate that substantial doubt exists related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that the closing of the sale of the MiFi Business is probable of occurring and mitigating the substantial doubt raised by our historical operating results and will satisfy our estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months following the filing date of this report. In the unlikely event that the sale of the MiFi Business does not close, we would require an alternative source of financing in order to divest the MiFi Business elsewhere or to otherwise streamline the MiFi Business as may be needed. In order to obtain such alternative financing, we must comply with certain requirements under the Revolver and the Inseego Indenture. We have had discussions with potential financing sources, and we believe that it is probable that such financing would be available to the Company based on terms that have been presented to the Company by financial sources.\nWe cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of the sale of the MiFi Business or any other activities to generate liquidity, including the availability of additional financing. If we are not able to generate additional liquidity through the mechanisms described above or through some combination of other actions, while not expected, we may not be able to access funds under our Revolver, and we may need to secure additional sources of funds, which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to production, inventory or services that are important to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations, a material failure to satisfy our contractual commitments or a failure to generate revenue from new or existing products.\nWe may also raise additional funds to accelerate development of new and existing services and products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. There can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, in order to obtain additional borrowings, we must comply with certain requirements under the Revolver and the Inseego Indenture. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interests and securities\nissued may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities, we may be subject to certain limitations on our operations. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our results of operations, financial conditions or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenues from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators, OEM customers and value added resellers and distributors. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of asset-management solutions utilizing wireless technology and M2M communication devices to transportation and industrial companies, medical device manufacturers and security system providers. Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon the later of transfer of title or delivery of the product to the customer. Where the transfer of title or risk of loss is contingent on the customer's acceptance of the product, we will not recognize revenue until both title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. We recognize revenues from SaaS services pro-rata over the contract term. We record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of when revenue recognition criteria are met. We have granted price protection to certain customers in accordance with the provisions of the respective contracts and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions. We estimate the amount of price protection for current period product sales utilizing historical experience and information regarding customer inventory levels. To date, we have not incurred material price protection obligations. Revenues from sales to certain customers are subject to cooperative advertising allowances. Cooperative advertising allowances are recorded as an operating expense to the extent that the advertising benefit is separable from the revenue transaction and the fair value of that advertising benefit is determinable. To the extent that such allowances either do not provide a separable benefit to us, or the fair value of the advertising benefit cannot be reliably estimated, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized. In estimating future product returns, we consider various factors, including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends.\nWe record our hardware revenue associated with the agreed upon price on hardware sales, and accrue any estimated costs of post-delivery performance obligations, such as warranty obligations. We consider the four basic revenue recognition criteria discussed under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 when assessing appropriate revenue recognition as follows:\nCriterion #1 - Persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist;\nCriterion #2 - Delivery has occurred;\nCriterion #3 - Our price to the buyer must be fixed or determinable; and,\nCriterion #4 - Collectability is reasonably assured.\nFor multiple element arrangements, total consideration received from customers is allocated to the elements. This may include hardware, non-essential software elements and/or essential software, based on a relative selling price. The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendors specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), (ii) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), and (iii) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d). Because we have neither VSOE nor TPE, revenue has been based on our BESP. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of the sale provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Amounts allocated to other deliverables based upon BESP are recognized in the period the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur process for determining BESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Our prices are determined based upon cost to produce our products, expected order quantities and acceptance in the marketplace. In addition, when developing BESPs for products, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives (if they exist) and product-specific business objectives.\nWe account for multiple element arrangements that primarily consist of software licenses and post contract support ( PCS\u201d) by recognizing revenue for such arrangements ratably over the term of the PCS as we have not established VSOE for the PCS element.\nWe provide SaaS subscriptions for our fleet and vehicle management solutions in which customers are provided with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile assets via software applications hosted by us. The customer has the option to purchase the monitoring device or lease it over the term of the contract. If the customer purchases the monitoring device, we recognize the revenue at the time of purchase. If the customer chooses to lease the monitoring device, we recognize the revenue for the monitoring device over the term of the contract. The Company records such revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 840, Leases, as we have determined that they qualify as operating leases. We recognize revenues from SaaS services over the term of the contract.\nCertain of our revenue is based on contractual arrangements. In such instances, management considers the nature of the Company's contractual arrangements in determining whether to recognize certain types of revenue on the basis of the gross amount billed or net amount retained after payments are made to providers of certain services related to the product or service offering. The main factors we use to determine whether to record revenue on a gross or net basis are whether:\n \u2022 we are primarily responsible for the service to the customer; \n \u2022 we have discretion in establishing fees paid by the customer; and \n \u2022 we are involved in the determination of product or service specifications.  When the customer's fee includes a portion of charges that are paid to another party and we are primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis in an amount equal to the fee paid by the customer. The cost of revenues recognized is the amount due to the other party and is recorded as cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. In instances in which another party is primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer, revenue is recognized in the net amount retained by the Company. The portion of the fees that we collect from the customer and remit to the other party are considered pass through amounts and accordingly are not a component of net revenues or cost of net revenues.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers' inability to pay. We determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions, historical losses, and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers' credit-worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, we review our customers' credit-worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services, our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers' industries. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nProvision for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Write-downs in inventory value or losses on inventory purchase commitments depend on various items, including factors related to customer demand, economic and competitive conditions, technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Whenever inventory is written down, a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve.\nWe believe that, when made, the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory. If customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates, inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisitions. When acquiring companies, we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support liabilities assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience, market data and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets the Company has acquired include but are not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from customer relationships; (ii) estimates to develop or use technology; and (iii) discount rates.\nIf management determines that a pre-acquisition contingency is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date, we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary fair value allocation. We continue to gather information for and evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, such amounts will be included in the fair value allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of operations.\nWe may be required to pay future consideration to the former shareholders of acquired companies, depending on the terms of the applicable purchase agreements, which may be contingent upon the achievement of certain financial and operating targets, as well as the retention of key employees. If the future consideration is considered to be compensation, amounts will be expensed when incurred.\nPurchased Intangible Assets. In determining the fair value allocation for our acquisitions, we considered, among other factors, our intended uses of the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for the acquired company's products and services. The estimated fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach. The income approach relies on an estimation of the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owner of an asset during its remaining economic life. This approach requires a projection of the cash flow that the asset is expected to generate in the future. The projected cash flow is discounted to its present value using a rate of return, or discount rate that accounts for the time value of money and the degree of risks inherent in the asset. The expected future cash flow that is projected should include all of the economic benefits attributable to the asset, including the tax savings associated with the amortization of the intangible asset value over the tax life of the asset. The income approach may take the form of a relief from royalty\u201d methodology, a cost savings methodology, a with and without\u201d methodology, or excess earnings methodology, depending on the specific asset under consideration.\nLong-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of the unamortized balances of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, rental assets and intangible assets, which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. We consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry or economic trends.\nOur assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to their associated undiscounted expected future cash flows, which are determined using an expected cash flow model. This model requires estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital and other relevant factors. We estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and other industry data. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThe timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long-lived assets below their carrying value. We monitor our long-lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present. We believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value long-lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management. The majority of our long-lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over approximately two to ten years. As most of these assets are associated with technology or trade conditions that may change rapidly; such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis.\nValuation of Goodwill. Our goodwill resulted from our acquisitions of FW and Ctrack during 2015. In accordance with the ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we will review goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value.\nConvertible Debt. We account for convertible debt instruments that are settleable in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) by separating the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects our\nnonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We determine the carrying amount of the liability component by measuring the fair value of similar debt instruments that do not have the conversion feature. If a similar debt instrument does not exist, we estimate the fair value by using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing a debt instrument, including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities. Determining the fair value of the debt component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the debt component and the associated non-cash interest expense.\nUpon issuance, we assign a value to the debt component equal to the estimated fair value of similar debt instruments without the conversion feature, which could result in our recording the debt instrument at a discount. If the debt instrument is recorded at a discount, we amortize the debt discount over the life of the debt instrument as additional non-cash interest expense utilizing the effective interest method.\nProvision for Warranty Costs. We accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement, repairs or rework of products. Our warranty policy generally provides between one and three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase. Our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized. In estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors, including the historical frequency and volume of claims, and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty. The warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs. Our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates; estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period, repair or rework expenses; and potential risks associated with our different products. The risk levels, warranty cost information, and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated, if and when, these inputs change.\nWe actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs, but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product, product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change, and as a result, we periodically introduce newer, more complex products. Depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing, actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We will record a loss when we determine information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates the loss is both probable and estimable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates, if necessary. Our policy is to expense litigation costs as incurred.\nShare-based Compensation. We have stock incentive plans under which stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors. We also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights, are recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards and stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable. The Black-Scholes model considers, among other factors, the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis. Although the Black-Scholes model is an acceptable model, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nCompensation cost associated with grants of restricted stock units are measured at fair value, which has historically been the closing price of our stock on the date of the grant.", "item_7_tables": "Table 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>
