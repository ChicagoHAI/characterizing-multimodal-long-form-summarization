Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Our historical results may not indicate, and should not be relied upon as an indication of, our future performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. See Item 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of risks associated with reliance on forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nWe design, manufacture and sell sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer and anti-vibration systems for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks manufactured by global OEMs. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the anti-vibration systems product line. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. In 2018, approximately 85% of our sales consisted of original equipment sold directly to OEMs for installation on new vehicles. The remaining 15% of our sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II suppliers and non-automotive manufacturers. Accordingly, sales of our products are directly affected by the annual vehicle production of OEMs and, in particular, the production levels of the vehicles for which we provide specific parts. Most of our products are custom designed and engineered for a specific vehicle platform. Our sales and product development personnel frequently work directly with the OEMs' engineering departments in the design and development of our various products.\nAlthough each OEM may emphasize different requirements as the primary criteria for judging its suppliers, we believe success as an automotive supplier generally requires outstanding performance with respect to quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and an extensive global footprint. Also, we believe our continued commitment to invest in global common processes is an important factor in servicing global customers with the same quality and consistency of product wherever we produce in the world. This is especially important when supplying products for global platforms.\nIn addition, to remain competitive and offset continued customer pricing pressure, we must also consistently achieve and sustain cost savings. In an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure, we run a global continuous improvement program which includes training for our employees, as well as implementation of lean tools, structured problem solving, best business practices, standardized processes and change management. We also evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities and to relocate certain operations to lower cost countries. We believe we will continue to be successful in our efforts to improve our design and engineering capability and manufacturing processes while achieving cost savings, including through our continuous improvement initiatives.\nOur OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.\nIn 2018, approximately 53% of our sales were generated in North America. Because of our significant international operations, we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in other countries, such as currency volatility, high interest and inflation rates, and the general political and economic risk that are associated with some of these markets.\nRecent Trends and Conditions\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Outlook\nThe global automotive industry is susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. Business conditions may vary significantly from period to period or region to region.\nIn North America in 2019, growth is expected to continue, albeit at a more modest rate. Rising interest rates and continued uncertainty regarding global trade relationships, among other factors, could dampen economic momentum. Modest economic growth is also expected to continue in Canada and Mexico in 2019. The mix of vehicles produced and sold in the region continues to shift away from passenger cars in favor of crossover utility vehicles and light trucks.\nIn Europe, economic expansion continued in 2018 although momentum slowed in the second half of the year. Geopolitical concerns and the implementation of new environmental regulations in the automotive industry likely contributed to the slow-down. Looking ahead, we expect financial pressures in Italy, the continuation of global trade tensions and Britain's pending separation from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) will challenge the regional economic outlook in 2019.\nThe Chinese government continues to manage the nation's economy with a goal of sustaining growth. The growth target for 2018 was approximately 6.5%. For 2019, the official target will likely be somewhat lower as rising debt, inflation and uncertainty are pressuring consumption and continuing tension within U.S.-China trade relationships is driving exports lower. Fiscal tools such as increased investment in infrastructure may be used to in order to meet government growth targets.\nThe Brazilian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2018. Stronger economic growth is forecasted in 2019 due to an improving labor market, rising credit growth and market-friendly government agenda. Based on this, our near-term outlook for South America is positive. We remain cautious for the mid to long-term outlook, however, given the long history of political instability and economic volatility in the region.\nThe current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of previously-announced tariffs; however we anticipate these and other tariffs to negatively impact material costs.\nRaw Materials\nOur business is susceptible to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. Costs related to raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and oil and oil-derived commodities, continue to be volatile. In addition, we expect commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and operating cash flows. As such, on an ongoing basis, we work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures.\nProduction Levels\nOur business is directly affected by the automotive vehicle production rates in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. New vehicle demand is driven by macroeconomic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. The industry could face uncertainties that may adversely impact consumer demand for vehicles as well as the future production environment.\nAccording to the forecasting firm IHS Markit, global light vehicle production was approximately 94 million units in 2018. This reflects a decline of approximately 1.0% globally.\nDetails on light vehicle production in certain regions for 2018 and 2017, as well as projections for 2019, are provided in the following table:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions of units)\n</td> <td>2019(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected % Change 2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change 2017-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific (2)\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Production data based on IHS Automotive, January 2019.\n(2) Includes Greater China units of 27.4, 27.0, and 28.0 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe anticipate that light vehicle production in North America and Europe will remain relatively stable over the next few years. In South America, we anticipate light vehicle production to be relatively strong in the near-term, but we remain cautious due to potential geo-political instability in the region.\nIndustry Overview\nCompetition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. Because of a growing emphasis on global vehicle platforms, automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will typically have a competitive advantage over smaller, regional competitors. This dynamic is likely to result in further consolidation of competing suppliers within our industry over time.\nOEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy.\nIncreased competitiveness in the industry, as well as customer focus on costs, has resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price reductions, reducing the overall profitability of the industry. Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continue to put additional pressures on the supply chain. These pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.\nIn addition to the above, other factors will present opportunities for automotive suppliers who are positioned for the changing environment, including autonomous and connected vehicles, evolving government regulation, and consumer preference for environmentally friendly products and technology, including hybrid and electric vehicle architectures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. These policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments that management makes in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if (i) it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and (ii) changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected could have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Such critical accounting estimates are discussed below. For these, materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions. Other items in our consolidated financial statements require estimation, however, in our judgment, they are not as critical as those discussed below.\nAcquisitions. Upon successful consummation of our 2018 acquisitions, we were subject to the accounting guidance as prescribed by ASC 805 - Business Combinations. We were required to allocate the purchase price of the acquired businesses to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on fair value. The excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with regard to intangible assets, requires significant levels of estimates and assumptions made by management. In order to assist management, we utilized third party valuation experts in determining the fair values.\nGoodwill. Our goodwill is tested for impairment as of October 1 of each year for all of our reporting units, and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review. For our goodwill analysis, fair values are based on the cash flows projected in the reporting units' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, discounted at a risk-adjusted rate of return. Our long-range planning forecasts are based on our assessment of revenue growth rates generally based on industry specific data, external vehicle build assumptions published by widely used external sources, and customer market share data based on known and targeted awards over a five-year period. The projected profit margin assumptions included in the plans are based on the current cost structure and adjustments for anticipated cost reductions or increases. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related cash flows used in measuring fair value could be different and impairment of goodwill might be recorded. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair values using market based multiples of comparable companies. In contemplation of our annual impairment analysis, we noted potential adverse changes in operating conditions. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2018 resulted in impairment for the Europe and Asia Pacific segments. The annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2017 resulted in no impairment. See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nLong-Lived Assets. We monitor our long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis. If impairment indicators exist, we analyze the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets compared to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon either a discounted cash flow analysis or estimated salvage values. Cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, as well as assumptions related to discount rates. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of long-lived assets. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed an impairment analysis of our long-lived assets based on changes in economic and operating conditions. Due to the deterioration of financial results, the analysis resulted in impairment at various locations in our Europe and Asia Pacific segments. See Note 8. Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nRestructuring. Specific accruals have been recorded in connection with restructuring initiatives. These accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities and contractual obligations. Actual amounts recognized could differ from the original estimates. Restructuring-related reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and changes to plans are appropriately recognized when identified. Changes to plans associated with the restructuring of existing businesses are generally recognized as employee separation and plant phase-out costs in the period the change occurs. See Note 7. Restructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Commitments. We generally enter into agreements with customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle's life. Although such contracts do not usually include minimum quantities, fulfillment of customers' purchasing requirements can be our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements generally may be terminated by our customer at any time, but such cancellations have historically been minimal. In limited cases, we may be committed to supply products at selling prices that do not cover our costs. In such situations, we recognize losses as they are incurred.\nWe receive blanket purchase orders from many customers annually. Generally, such purchase orders and related documents establish the annual terms, including pricing, related to a vehicle model. However, purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. We recognize revenue based on a point in time, generally when products are shipped or delivered to customers. As part of certain agreements, customers ask for cost reductions. We accrue for such concessions by reducing revenue as products are shipped. We also generally have ongoing adjustments to customer pricing arrangements based on the content and cost of our products. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with customers.\nIncome Taxes. In determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes, we make estimates and judgments which affect our evaluation of the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as well as our calculation of certain tax liabilities. We evaluate the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, expectations for future pretax operating income, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nConcluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize three years' cumulative pre-tax book results adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of cumulative results in recent years. In certain foreign jurisdictions, our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis. This is considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome. However, the three-year loss position is not solely determinative, and, accordingly, management considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based upon this analysis, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized in the future. Accordingly, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets. However, since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be\nmaterially different from our estimated liabilities. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Included in our results of operations are significant pension and postretirement benefit costs, which are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality rates, expected returns on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are determined as of the current year measurement date. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Our net pension and postretirement benefit costs were approximately $6.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo develop the discount rate for each pension plan, the expected cash flows underlying the plan's benefit obligations were discounted using a December 31, 2018 pension index to determine a single equivalent rate. To develop our expected return on plan assets, we considered historical long-term asset return experience, the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long-term investment returns. To develop our portfolio of plan assets, we considered the duration of the plan liabilities and gave more weight to equity positions, including both public and private equity investments, than to fixed-income securities.\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine pension benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sensitivity of our pension cost and obligations to changes in key assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, is as follows:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assumption\n</td> <td>Impact on 2019 net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on PBO as of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>- $1.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- $49.9 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>+ $1.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+ $61.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>- $3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>+ $3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAggregate pension net periodic benefit cost is forecasted to be approximately $7.9 million in 2019.\nHealth care cost trend rates are assumed to reflect market trend, actual experience and future expectations.

During 2018, the Company made a discretionary contribution of $15.0 million to its U.S. pension plan. The Company estimates it will make funding cash contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans of approximately $2.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively in 2019.\nThe Company does not prefund its postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect net other postretirement benefit payments to be approximately $2.5 million in 2019.\nResults of Operations\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $129.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 51% of total cost of products sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Cost of products sold was impacted by vehicle production mix, commodity price and foreign exchange pressures, as well as acquisitions. These items were partially offset by continuous improvement, restructuring savings and material cost reductions.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $117.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 15.3% and 18.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in margin was driven by unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressures and foreign exchange, partially offset by net favorable operational performance and acquisitions.\nSelling, Administration and Engineering. Selling, administration and engineering expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $314.8 million, or 8.7% of sales, compared to $341.0 million, or 9.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Selling, administration and engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were favorable as a result of lower compensation-related costs and efficiencies related to cost improvement initiatives, partially offset by wage inflation.\nImpairment Charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $45.3 million of goodwill impairment charges, $42.9 million of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and $0.8 million of intangible impairment charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $4.3 million related to our decision to divest two of our inactive European sites, and $10.5 million related to the deterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities, two of our European locations and one of our North American locations.\nRestructuring. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $5.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses of $8.1 million related to the substantial completion of our European initiatives, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the Asia Pacific segment.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $1.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in March 2018.\nLoss on Refinancing and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, which resulted from the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in March 2018.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $10.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost and foreign currency losses in the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.7 million on earnings before taxes of $74.9 million. This compares to income tax expense of $74.5 million on earnings before taxes of $213.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit in 2018 differed from the statutory rate due to the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss carryforwards and other timing items in France, in addition to a capital loss carryforward in the U.S. Additional items impacting income taxes were a discrete benefit resulting from the finalization of U.S. tax reform calculations, the mix of income between the U.S. and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items. Tax expense in 2017 differed from the statutory rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, the mix of income between the U.S. and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\nSales\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 4.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume / Mix*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,618,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,472,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Net of customer price reductions\n** Other includes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures\nGross Profit\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume / Mix*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost Increases / (Decreases)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,946,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,808,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>671,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>664,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit percentage of sales\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Net of customer price reductions\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $138.6 million or 4.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 51% of total cost of products sold for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cost of products sold was impacted by higher production volumes, commodity price and foreign exchange pressures, as well as our acquisitions. These items were partially offset by continuous improvement, restructuring savings and material cost reductions.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 18.6% and 19.1% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in margin was driven by unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressures and foreign exchange, partially offset by net favorable operational performance and acquisitions.\nSelling, Administration and Engineering. Selling, administration and engineering expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $341.0 million or 9.4% of sales compared to $356.6 million, or 10.3%, of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, administration and engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were favorable as a result of lower compensation-related costs, partially offset by investment for growth and innovation.\nImpairment Charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $4.3 million related to our decision to divest two of our inactive European sites, and $10.5 million related to the\ndeterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities, two of our European locations and one of our North American locations. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the deterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities.\nRestructuring. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses of $16.1 million related to the substantial completion of our European initiatives, partially offset by higher restructuring charges of $5.2 million in other regions.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted primarily from higher interest rates related to the Senior Notes.\nLoss on Refinancing and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million, which resulted from the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in May 2017.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the reclassification of components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost and foreign currency losses, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of underwriting fees related to the secondary offering of $5.9 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016 and other miscellaneous income recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $74.5 million on earnings before taxes of $213.1 million. This compares to income tax expense of $54.3 million on earnings before taxes of $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tax expense in 2017 and 2016 differed from the statutory rate due to a charge of $33.5 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, the mix of income between the United States and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company operates in four reportable segments: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America.

Resources\nShort and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks\nWe intend to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our ABL Facility, and receivables factoring. The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 10. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for a detailed discussion of terms and conditions related to our debt.\nBased on our current and anticipated levels of operations and the condition in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our ABL Facility and receivables factoring will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations under our ABL Facility, depend on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry, financial and economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower inflow was primarily driven by changes in the utilization of the accounts receivable factoring program, lower cash earnings, changes in compensation-related accruals, and our discretionary pension contribution.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $365.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by an increase in receivables due to growth, increased inventory, higher payments related to incentive compensation, increased liabilities related to our factoring arrangement and higher cash paid for interest, partially offset by increased cash earnings and reduced cash paid for restructuring and taxes.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $383.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending on programs related to sales growth and innovation, and cash paid for the acquisition of businesses, which consisted primarily of $92.7 million for the Lauren acquisition and $42.3 million for the Hutchings acquisition, partially offset by land sale proceeds. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $180 million to $190 million on capital expenditures in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending, partially offset by lower cash spent for acquisitions of business.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher borrowings of short-term debt and lower principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by repurchase activity under our share repurchase program.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased repurchase activity under our share repurchase program and certain paydowns of foreign bank loans in 2017, partially offset by an increase in short-term debt.\nSenior Notes\nOn November 2, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CSA U.S. (the Issuer\u201d) completed a private offering of debt securities consisting of the issuance of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% notes due 2026 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay the non-extended term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the refinancing. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, as well as each of CSA U.S.'s wholly-owned existing or subsequently organized U.S. subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to the extent such subsidiary guarantees the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Notes at various points in time prior to maturity, as described in the indenture. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2026. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nIf a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture) occurs, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nABL Facility\nOn November 2, 2016, CS Intermediate Holdco 1 LLC ( Parent\u201d), CSA U.S. (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive International Holdings B.V. (the Dutch Borrower\u201d, and, together with the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower, the Borrowers\u201d) and certain subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower, entered into a third amendment of our ABL Facility. Pursuant to the ABL Facility agreement, as amended, we have an aggregate revolving loan availability of up to $210.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability. In addition, our ABL Facility provides for an uncommitted $100.0 million incremental loan facility, for a potential total ABL Facility of $310.0 million. Any borrowings under our ABL Facility will mature, and the commitments of the lenders under our ABL Facility will terminate, on November 2, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility includes affirmative and negative covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations. The ABL Facility also contains various events of default that are customary for comparable facilities.\nLoan and letter of credit availability under the agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which at any time is limited to the lesser of: (A) the maximum facility amount (subject to certain adjustments) and (B) (i) up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable; plus (ii) the lesser of 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory; plus (iii) up to the lesser of $30.0 million and 75% of eligible tooling accounts receivable; minus reserves established by the agent. The obligations under the ABL Facility and the related guarantees are secured by various assets, as detailed in Note 10. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrowers' option:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in the case of borrowings by U.S. Borrower, London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in the case of borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, bankers' acceptance ( BA\u201d) rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in the case of borrowings by the Dutch Borrower, LIBOR plus an applicable margin.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The applicable margin may vary between 1.25% and 1.75% with respect to the LIBOR or Canadian BA rate-based borrowings and between 0.25% and 0.75% with respect to U.S. base rate, Canadian prime rate and Canadian base rate borrowings. The applicable margin is subject, in each case, to quarterly pricing adjustments (based on average facility availability).\nAs of December 31, 2018, $50.0 million was drawn under the ABL Facility, and subject to borrowing base availability, the Company had $155.1 million in availability, less outstanding letters of credit of $10.8 million. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs.\nTerm Loan Facility - Amendments\nOn November 2, 2016, CSA U.S., as borrower, entered into the first amendment of our Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of $340.0 million. Subject to certain conditions, the Term Loan Facility, without the consent of the then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), may be expanded (or a new term loan or revolving facility added) by an amount that will not cause the consolidated secured net debt ratio to exceed 2.25 to 1.00, plus $400.0 million, plus any voluntary prepayments (including revolving facility and ABL Facility to the extent commitments are reduced) not funded from proceeds of long-term indebtedness. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 2, 2023, unless earlier terminated.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains incurrence-based negative covenants customary for high yield senior secured debt securities. These negative covenants are subject to exceptions, qualifications and certain carveouts.\nOn May 2, 2017, CSA U.S. entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Loan Facility to modify the interest rate. Subsequently, on March 6, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Term Loan Facility to further modify the interest rate. In accordance with this amendment, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (1) with respect to Eurodollar rate loans, the greater of the applicable Eurodollar rate and 0.75% plus 2.0% per annum, or (2) with respect to base rate loans, the base rate, (which is the highest of the then current federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under the term loan, and the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus 1.0% per annum. As a result of the Amendment No. 3, the Company recognized a loss on refinancing and\nextinguishment of debt of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, which was due to the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount.\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by us and the wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries of CSA U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the principal amount of $333.2 million was outstanding, and the Company had $2.9 million unamortized debt issuance costs and $1.8 million of unamortized original issue discount.\nRepayment of the Term Loan Facility\nOn November 2, 2016, we repaid the non-extended term loan outstanding under the Term Loan Facility of $393.1 million. As a result of the repayment, the Company recognized a loss on refinancing of $5.1 million, which was primarily due to the write off of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. The Company used proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the non-extended term loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs a part of our working capital management, we sell certain accounts receivable through a third party financial institution in off-balance sheet arrangements. The amount sold varies each month based on the amount of underlying receivables and cash flow needs. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $100.4 million and $96.6 million, respectively, of receivables outstanding under receivable transfer agreements entered into by various locations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, total accounts receivable factored were $626.6 million and $544.1 million, respectively. Costs incurred on the sale of receivables were $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other expense, net and interest expense, net of interest income in the consolidated statements of net income. These are permitted transactions under the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Capital Transactions Impacting Liquidity\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program (the 2018 Program\u201d) authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the 2018 Program, repurchases may be made on the open market, through private transactions, accelerated share repurchases, round lot or block transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise, as determined by our management and in accordance with prevailing market conditions and federal securities laws and regulations. The 2018 Program was effective in November 2018. The common stock repurchase program approved in March 2016 was fully utilized as of December 31, 2018.\nIn March 2016, we purchased $23.8 million of our common stock (350,000 shares at $68.00 per share) from the Selling Stockholders (as described in Note 19. Equity\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report). In 2017, we repurchased $55.9 million of our common stock (513,801 shares at an average purchase price of $108.87 per share, excluding commissions) in the open market, of which $55.1 million was settled in cash during the year ended December 31, 2017. In June 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase our common stock. Under the ASR agreement, we made an up-front payment of $35.0 million. The repurchase was completed in the third quarter of 2018, and a total of 258,285 shares were repurchased at a weighted average purchase price of $135.51 per share. In addition to the repurchase under the ASR agreement, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 324,508 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $78.78 per share, excluding commissions, for a total cost of $25.6 million.\nWe expect to fund any future repurchases from cash on hand and future cash flows from operations. The specific timing and amount of repurchase will vary based on market and business conditions and other factors, including alternative uses of capital. We are not obligated to repurchase any number of shares or dollar amount, and the 2018 Program may be discontinued at any time at our discretion.\nSee Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\u201d and Note 19. Equity.\u201d\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the vendor to provide future goods or services. Except as otherwise disclosed, this table does not include information on our recurring purchase of materials for use in production because our raw materials purchase contracts typically do not require fixed or minimum quantities.\nThe following table summarizes the total amounts due as of December 31, 2018 under all debt agreements at nominal value, undiscounted capital lease commitments and other contractual obligations.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>831.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt obligations\n</td> <td>258.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>183.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,307.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>558.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our contractual obligations and commitments set forth in the table above, we have employment arrangements with certain key executives that provide for continuity of management. These arrangements include payments of multiples of annual salary, certain incentives and continuation of benefits upon the occurrence of specified events in a manner believed to be consistent with comparable companies.\nWe also have funding requirements with respect to our pension obligations. We expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. and foreign pension plans of approximately $2.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in 2019. Our minimum funding requirements after 2019 will depend on several factors, including the investment performance of our retirement plans and prevailing interest rates. Our funding obligations may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements. We also have payments due with respect to our postretirement benefit obligations. We do not prefund our postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect net other postretirement benefit payments to be approximately $2.5 million in 2019.\nWe may be required to make significant cash outlays due to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $9.6 million as of December 31, 2018 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nExcluded from the contractual obligations table above are open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018 for raw materials, supplies and capital expenditures in the normal course of business, supply contracts with customers, distribution agreements, joint venture agreements and other contracts without express funding requirements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating our business, management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our operating performance. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>because similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in our financing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in developing our internal budgets and forecasts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>as a significant factor in evaluating our management for compensation purposes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in evaluating potential acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in comparing our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board of directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management in their assessments of performance and in forecasting and budgeting for our company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization (or EBITDA\u201d), as adjusted for items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring costs, impairment charges, non-cash fair value adjustments and acquisition related costs.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measurements recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not as alternatives for, net income (loss), operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. These limitations include the following:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>they do not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments under our ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>they do not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently and, as the number of differences in the way companies calculate these measures increases, the degree of their usefulness as a comparative measure correspondingly decreases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, it should be noted that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the below presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by special items.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income, which is the most comparable financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(29,683\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of interest income\n</td> <td>41,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>146,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other impairment charges (1)\n</td> <td>43,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment charges (2)\n</td> <td>39,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges (3)\n</td> <td>29,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of land (4)\n</td> <td>(10,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project costs (5)\n</td> <td>4,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of inventory write-up (6)\n</td> <td>1,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlement charges (7)\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt (8)\n</td> <td>770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign tax amnesty program (9)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secondary offering underwriting fees and other expenses (10)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>452,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Other non-cash impairment charges in 2018 related to intangible assets of $791 and fixed assets of $42,915.

Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nWe design, manufacture and sell sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer and anti-vibration systems for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks manufactured by global OEMs. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the anti-vibration systems product line. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. In 2018, approximately 85% of our sales consisted of original equipment sold directly to OEMs for installation on new vehicles. The remaining 15% of our sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II suppliers and non-automotive manufacturers. Accordingly, sales of our products are directly affected by the annual vehicle production of OEMs and, in particular, the production levels of the vehicles for which we provide specific parts. Most of our products are custom designed and engineered for a specific vehicle platform. Our sales and product development personnel frequently work directly with the OEMs' engineering departments in the design and development of our various products.\nAlthough each OEM may emphasize different requirements as the primary criteria for judging its suppliers, we believe success as an automotive supplier generally requires outstanding performance with respect to quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and an extensive global footprint. Also, we believe our continued commitment to invest in global common processes is an important factor in servicing global customers with the same quality and consistency of product wherever we produce in the world. This is especially important when supplying products for global platforms.\nIn addition, to remain competitive and offset continued customer pricing pressure, we must also consistently achieve and sustain cost savings. In an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure, we run a global continuous improvement program which includes training for our employees, as well as implementation of lean tools, structured problem solving, best business practices, standardized processes and change management. We also evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities and to relocate certain operations to lower cost countries. We believe we will continue to be successful in our efforts to improve our design and engineering capability and manufacturing processes while achieving cost savings, including through our continuous improvement initiatives.\nOur OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.\nIn 2018, approximately 53% of our sales were generated in North America. Because of our significant international operations, we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in other countries, such as currency volatility, high interest and inflation rates, and the general political and economic risk that are associated with some of these markets.\nRecent Trends and Conditions\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Outlook\nThe global automotive industry is susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. Business conditions may vary significantly from period to period or region to region.\nIn North America in 2019, growth is expected to continue, albeit at a more modest rate. Rising interest rates and continued uncertainty regarding global trade relationships, among other factors, could dampen economic momentum. Modest economic growth is also expected to continue in Canada and Mexico in 2019. The mix of vehicles produced and sold in the region continues to shift away from passenger cars in favor of crossover utility vehicles and light trucks.\nIn Europe, economic expansion continued in 2018 although momentum slowed in the second half of the year. Geopolitical concerns and the implementation of new environmental regulations in the automotive industry likely contributed to the slow-down. Looking ahead, we expect financial pressures in Italy, the continuation of global trade tensions and Britain's pending separation from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) will challenge the regional economic outlook in 2019.\nThe Chinese government continues to manage the nation's economy with a goal of sustaining growth. The growth target for 2018 was approximately 6.5%. For 2019, the official target will likely be somewhat lower as rising debt, inflation and uncertainty are pressuring consumption and continuing tension within U.S.-China trade relationships is driving exports lower. Fiscal tools such as increased investment in infrastructure may be used to in order to meet government growth targets.\nThe Brazilian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2018. Stronger economic growth is forecasted in 2019 due to an improving labor market, rising credit growth and market-friendly government agenda. Based on this, our near-term outlook for South America is positive. We remain cautious for the mid to long-term outlook, however, given the long history of political instability and economic volatility in the region.\nThe current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of previously-announced tariffs; however we anticipate these and other tariffs to negatively impact material costs.\nRaw Materials\nOur business is susceptible to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. Costs related to raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and oil and oil-derived commodities, continue to be volatile. In addition, we expect commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and operating cash flows. As such, on an ongoing basis, we work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures.\nProduction Levels\nOur business is directly affected by the automotive vehicle production rates in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. New vehicle demand is driven by macroeconomic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. The industry could face uncertainties that may adversely impact consumer demand for vehicles as well as the future production environment.\nAccording to the forecasting firm IHS Markit, global light vehicle production was approximately 94 million units in 2018. This reflects a decline of approximately 1.0% globally.\nDetails on light vehicle production in certain regions for 2018 and 2017, as well as projections for 2019, are provided in the following table:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions of units)\n</td> <td>2019(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected % Change 2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change 2017-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific (2)\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Production data based on IHS Automotive, January 2019.\n(2) Includes Greater China units of 27.4, 27.0, and 28.0 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe anticipate that light vehicle production in North America and Europe will remain relatively stable over the next few years. In South America, we anticipate light vehicle production to be relatively strong in the near-term, but we remain cautious due to potential geo-political instability in the region.\nIndustry Overview\nCompetition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. Because of a growing emphasis on global vehicle platforms, automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will typically have a competitive advantage over smaller, regional competitors. This dynamic is likely to result in further consolidation of competing suppliers within our industry over time.\nOEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy.\nIncreased competitiveness in the industry, as well as customer focus on costs, has resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price reductions, reducing the overall profitability of the industry. Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continue to put additional pressures on the supply chain. These pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.\nIn addition to the above, other factors will present opportunities for automotive suppliers who are positioned for the changing environment, including autonomous and connected vehicles, evolving government regulation, and consumer preference for environmentally friendly products and technology, including hybrid and electric vehicle architectures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. These policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments that management makes in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if (i) it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and (ii) changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected could have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Such critical accounting estimates are discussed below. For these, materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions. Other items in our consolidated financial statements require estimation, however, in our judgment, they are not as critical as those discussed below.\nAcquisitions. Upon successful consummation of our 2018 acquisitions, we were subject to the accounting guidance as prescribed by ASC 805 - Business Combinations. We were required to allocate the purchase price of the acquired businesses to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on fair value. The excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with regard to intangible assets, requires significant levels of estimates and assumptions made by management. In order to assist management, we utilized third party valuation experts in determining the fair values.\nGoodwill. Our goodwill is tested for impairment as of October 1 of each year for all of our reporting units, and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review. For our goodwill analysis, fair values are based on the cash flows projected in the reporting units' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, discounted at a risk-adjusted rate of return. Our long-range planning forecasts are based on our assessment of revenue growth rates generally based on industry specific data, external vehicle build assumptions published by widely used external sources, and customer market share data based on known and targeted awards over a five-year period. The projected profit margin assumptions included in the plans are based on the current cost structure and adjustments for anticipated cost reductions or increases. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related cash flows used in measuring fair value could be different and impairment of goodwill might be recorded. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair values using market based multiples of comparable companies. In contemplation of our annual impairment analysis, we noted potential adverse changes in operating conditions. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2018 resulted in impairment for the Europe and Asia Pacific segments. The annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2017 resulted in no impairment. See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nLong-Lived Assets. We monitor our long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis. If impairment indicators exist, we analyze the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets compared to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon either a discounted cash flow analysis or estimated salvage values. Cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, as well as assumptions related to discount rates. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of long-lived assets. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed an impairment analysis of our long-lived assets based on changes in economic and operating conditions. Due to the deterioration of financial results, the analysis resulted in impairment at various locations in our Europe and Asia Pacific segments. See Note 8. Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nRestructuring. Specific accruals have been recorded in connection with restructuring initiatives. These accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities and contractual obligations. Actual amounts recognized could differ from the original estimates. Restructuring-related reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and changes to plans are appropriately recognized when identified. Changes to plans associated with the restructuring of existing businesses are generally recognized as employee separation and plant phase-out costs in the period the change occurs. See Note 7. Restructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Commitments. We generally enter into agreements with customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle's life. Although such contracts do not usually include minimum quantities, fulfillment of customers' purchasing requirements can be our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements generally may be terminated by our customer at any time, but such cancellations have historically been minimal. In limited cases, we may be committed to supply products at selling prices that do not cover our costs. In such situations, we recognize losses as they are incurred.\nWe receive blanket purchase orders from many customers annually. Generally, such purchase orders and related documents establish the annual terms, including pricing, related to a vehicle model. However, purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. We recognize revenue based on a point in time, generally when products are shipped or delivered to customers. As part of certain agreements, customers ask for cost reductions. We accrue for such concessions by reducing revenue as products are shipped. We also generally have ongoing adjustments to customer pricing arrangements based on the content and cost of our products. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with customers.\nIncome Taxes. In determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes, we make estimates and judgments which affect our evaluation of the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as well as our calculation of certain tax liabilities. We evaluate the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, expectations for future pretax operating income, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nConcluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize three years' cumulative pre-tax book results adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of cumulative results in recent years. In certain foreign jurisdictions, our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis. This is considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome. However, the three-year loss position is not solely determinative, and, accordingly, management considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based upon this analysis, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized in the future. Accordingly, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets. However, since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be\nmaterially different from our estimated liabilities. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Included in our results of operations are significant pension and postretirement benefit costs, which are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality rates, expected returns on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are determined as of the current year measurement date. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Our net pension and postretirement benefit costs were approximately $6.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo develop the discount rate for each pension plan, the expected cash flows underlying the plan's benefit obligations were discounted using a December 31, 2018 pension index to determine a single equivalent rate. To develop our expected return on plan assets, we considered historical long-term asset return experience, the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long-term investment returns. To develop our portfolio of plan assets, we considered the duration of the plan liabilities and gave more weight to equity positions, including both public and private equity investments, than to fixed-income securities.\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine pension benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>3.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sensitivity of our pension cost and obligations to changes in key assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, is as follows:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assumption\n</td> <td>Impact on 2019 net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on PBO as of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>- $1.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- $49.9 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>+ $1.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+ $61.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>- $3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>+ $3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAggregate pension net periodic benefit cost is forecasted to be approximately $7.9 million in 2019.\nHealth care cost trend rates are assumed to reflect market trend, actual experience and future expectations.

During 2018, the Company made a discretionary contribution of $15.0 million to its U.S. pension plan. The Company estimates it will make funding cash contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans of approximately $2.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively in 2019.\nThe Company does not prefund its postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect net other postretirement benefit payments to be approximately $2.5 million in 2019.\nResults of Operations\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $129.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 51% of total cost of products sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Cost of products sold was impacted by vehicle production mix, commodity price and foreign exchange pressures, as well as acquisitions. These items were partially offset by continuous improvement, restructuring savings and material cost reductions.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $117.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 15.3% and 18.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in margin was driven by unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressures and foreign exchange, partially offset by net favorable operational performance and acquisitions.\nSelling, Administration and Engineering. Selling, administration and engineering expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $314.8 million, or 8.7% of sales, compared to $341.0 million, or 9.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Selling, administration and engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were favorable as a result of lower compensation-related costs and efficiencies related to cost improvement initiatives, partially offset by wage inflation.\nImpairment Charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $45.3 million of goodwill impairment charges, $42.9 million of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and $0.8 million of intangible impairment charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $4.3 million related to our decision to divest two of our inactive European sites, and $10.5 million related to the deterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities, two of our European locations and one of our North American locations.\nRestructuring. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $5.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses of $8.1 million related to the substantial completion of our European initiatives, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the Asia Pacific segment.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $1.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in March 2018.\nLoss on Refinancing and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, which resulted from the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in March 2018.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $10.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost and foreign currency losses in the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.7 million on earnings before taxes of $74.9 million. This compares to income tax expense of $74.5 million on earnings before taxes of $213.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit in 2018 differed from the statutory rate due to the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss carryforwards and other timing items in France, in addition to a capital loss carryforward in the U.S. Additional items impacting income taxes were a discrete benefit resulting from the finalization of U.S. tax reform calculations, the mix of income between the U.S. and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items. Tax expense in 2017 differed from the statutory rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, the mix of income between the U.S. and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\nSales\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 4.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume / Mix*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other**\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,618,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,472,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Net of customer price reductions\n** Other includes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures\nGross Profit\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance Due To:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume / Mix*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost Increases / (Decreases)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,946,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,808,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>671,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>664,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit percentage of sales\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Net of customer price reductions\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $138.6 million or 4.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 51% of total cost of products sold for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cost of products sold was impacted by higher production volumes, commodity price and foreign exchange pressures, as well as our acquisitions. These items were partially offset by continuous improvement, restructuring savings and material cost reductions.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 18.6% and 19.1% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in margin was driven by unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressures and foreign exchange, partially offset by net favorable operational performance and acquisitions.\nSelling, Administration and Engineering. Selling, administration and engineering expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $341.0 million or 9.4% of sales compared to $356.6 million, or 10.3%, of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, administration and engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were favorable as a result of lower compensation-related costs, partially offset by investment for growth and innovation.\nImpairment Charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $4.3 million related to our decision to divest two of our inactive European sites, and $10.5 million related to the\ndeterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities, two of our European locations and one of our North American locations. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the deterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities.\nRestructuring. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses of $16.1 million related to the substantial completion of our European initiatives, partially offset by higher restructuring charges of $5.2 million in other regions.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted primarily from higher interest rates related to the Senior Notes.\nLoss on Refinancing and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million, which resulted from the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in May 2017.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the reclassification of components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost and foreign currency losses, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of underwriting fees related to the secondary offering of $5.9 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016 and other miscellaneous income recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $74.5 million on earnings before taxes of $213.1 million. This compares to income tax expense of $54.3 million on earnings before taxes of $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tax expense in 2017 and 2016 differed from the statutory rate due to a charge of $33.5 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, the mix of income between the United States and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company operates in four reportable segments: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment profit before tax. The results of each segment include certain allocations for general, administrative, interest, and other shared costs. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 10. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for a detailed discussion of terms and conditions related to our debt.\nBased on our current and anticipated levels of operations and the condition in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our ABL Facility and receivables factoring will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations under our ABL Facility, depend on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry, financial and economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower inflow was primarily driven by changes in the utilization of the accounts receivable factoring program, lower cash earnings, changes in compensation-related accruals, and our discretionary pension contribution.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $365.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by an increase in receivables due to growth, increased inventory, higher payments related to incentive compensation, increased liabilities related to our factoring arrangement and higher cash paid for interest, partially offset by increased cash earnings and reduced cash paid for restructuring and taxes.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $383.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending on programs related to sales growth and innovation, and cash paid for the acquisition of businesses, which consisted primarily of $92.7 million for the Lauren acquisition and $42.3 million for the Hutchings acquisition, partially offset by land sale proceeds. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $180 million to $190 million on capital expenditures in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending, partially offset by lower cash spent for acquisitions of business.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher borrowings of short-term debt and lower principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by repurchase activity under our share repurchase program.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased repurchase activity under our share repurchase program and certain paydowns of foreign bank loans in 2017, partially offset by an increase in short-term debt.\nSenior Notes\nOn November 2, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CSA U.S. (the Issuer\u201d) completed a private offering of debt securities consisting of the issuance of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% notes due 2026 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay the non-extended term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the refinancing. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, as well as each of CSA U.S.'s wholly-owned existing or subsequently organized U.S. subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to the extent such subsidiary guarantees the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Notes at various points in time prior to maturity, as described in the indenture. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2026. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nIf a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture) occurs, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nABL Facility\nOn November 2, 2016, CS Intermediate Holdco 1 LLC ( Parent\u201d), CSA U.S. (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive International Holdings B.V. (the Dutch Borrower\u201d, and, together with the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower, the Borrowers\u201d) and certain subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower, entered into a third amendment of our ABL Facility. Pursuant to the ABL Facility agreement, as amended, we have an aggregate revolving loan availability of up to $210.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability. In addition, our ABL Facility provides for an uncommitted $100.0 million incremental loan facility, for a potential total ABL Facility of $310.0 million. Any borrowings under our ABL Facility will mature, and the commitments of the lenders under our ABL Facility will terminate, on November 2, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility includes affirmative and negative covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations. The ABL Facility also contains various events of default that are customary for comparable facilities.\nLoan and letter of credit availability under the agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which at any time is limited to the lesser of: (A) the maximum facility amount (subject to certain adjustments) and (B) (i) up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable; plus (ii) the lesser of 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory; plus (iii) up to the lesser of $30.0 million and 75% of eligible tooling accounts receivable; minus reserves established by the agent. The obligations under the ABL Facility and the related guarantees are secured by various assets, as detailed in Note 10. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrowers' option:\n \u2022 in the case of borrowings by U.S. Borrower, London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or \n \u2022 in the case of borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, bankers' acceptance ( BA\u201d) rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or \n \u2022 in the case of borrowings by the Dutch Borrower, LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin may vary between 1.25% and 1.75% with respect to the LIBOR or Canadian BA rate-based borrowings and between 0.25% and 0.75% with respect to U.S. base rate, Canadian prime rate and Canadian base rate borrowings. The applicable margin is subject, in each case, to quarterly pricing adjustments (based on average facility availability).\nAs of December 31, 2018, $50.0 million was drawn under the ABL Facility, and subject to borrowing base availability, the Company had $155.1 million in availability, less outstanding letters of credit of $10.8 million. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs.\nTerm Loan Facility - Amendments\nOn November 2, 2016, CSA U.S., as borrower, entered into the first amendment of our Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of $340.0 million. Subject to certain conditions, the Term Loan Facility, without the consent of the then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), may be expanded (or a new term loan or revolving facility added) by an amount that will not cause the consolidated secured net debt ratio to exceed 2.25 to 1.00, plus $400.0 million, plus any voluntary prepayments (including revolving facility and ABL Facility to the extent commitments are reduced) not funded from proceeds of long-term indebtedness. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 2, 2023, unless earlier terminated.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains incurrence-based negative covenants customary for high yield senior secured debt securities. These negative covenants are subject to exceptions, qualifications and certain carveouts.\nOn May 2, 2017, CSA U.S. entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Loan Facility to modify the interest rate. Subsequently, on March 6, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Term Loan Facility to further modify the interest rate. In accordance with this amendment, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (1) with respect to Eurodollar rate loans, the greater of the applicable Eurodollar rate and 0.75% plus 2.0% per annum, or (2) with respect to base rate loans, the base rate, (which is the highest of the then current federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under the term loan, and the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus 1.0% per annum. As a result of the Amendment No. 3, the Company recognized a loss on refinancing and\nextinguishment of debt of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, which was due to the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount.\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by us and the wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries of CSA U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the principal amount of $333.2 million was outstanding, and the Company had $2.9 million unamortized debt issuance costs and $1.8 million of unamortized original issue discount.\nRepayment of the Term Loan Facility\nOn November 2, 2016, we repaid the non-extended term loan outstanding under the Term Loan Facility of $393.1 million. As a result of the repayment, the Company recognized a loss on refinancing of $5.1 million, which was primarily due to the write off of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. The Company used proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the non-extended term loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs a part of our working capital management, we sell certain accounts receivable through a third party financial institution in off-balance sheet arrangements. The amount sold varies each month based on the amount of underlying receivables and cash flow needs. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $100.4 million and $96.6 million, respectively, of receivables outstanding under receivable transfer agreements entered into by various locations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, total accounts receivable factored were $626.6 million and $544.1 million, respectively. Costs incurred on the sale of receivables were $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other expense, net and interest expense, net of interest income in the consolidated statements of net income. These are permitted transactions under the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Capital Transactions Impacting Liquidity\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program (the 2018 Program\u201d) authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the 2018 Program, repurchases may be made on the open market, through private transactions, accelerated share repurchases, round lot or block transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise, as determined by our management and in accordance with prevailing market conditions and federal securities laws and regulations. The 2018 Program was effective in November 2018. The common stock repurchase program approved in March 2016 was fully utilized as of December 31, 2018.\nIn March 2016, we purchased $23.8 million of our common stock (350,000 shares at $68.00 per share) from the Selling Stockholders (as described in Note 19. Equity\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report). In 2017, we repurchased $55.9 million of our common stock (513,801 shares at an average purchase price of $108.87 per share, excluding commissions) in the open market, of which $55.1 million was settled in cash during the year ended December 31, 2017. In June 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase our common stock. Under the ASR agreement, we made an up-front payment of $35.0 million. The repurchase was completed in the third quarter of 2018, and a total of 258,285 shares were repurchased at a weighted average purchase price of $135.51 per share. In addition to the repurchase under the ASR agreement, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 324,508 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $78.78 per share, excluding commissions, for a total cost of $25.6 million.\nWe expect to fund any future repurchases from cash on hand and future cash flows from operations. The specific timing and amount of repurchase will vary based on market and business conditions and other factors, including alternative uses of capital. We are not obligated to repurchase any number of shares or dollar amount, and the 2018 Program may be discontinued at any time at our discretion.\nSee Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\u201d and Note 19. Equity.\u201d\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the vendor to provide future goods or services. Except as otherwise disclosed, this table does not include information on our recurring purchase of materials for use in production because our raw materials purchase contracts typically do not require fixed or minimum quantities.\nThe following table summarizes the total amounts due as of December 31, 2018 under all debt agreements at nominal value, undiscounted capital lease commitments and other contractual obligations.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollar amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>831.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt obligations\n</td> <td>258.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>183.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,307.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>558.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our contractual obligations and commitments set forth in the table above, we have employment arrangements with certain key executives that provide for continuity of management. These arrangements include payments of multiples of annual salary, certain incentives and continuation of benefits upon the occurrence of specified events in a manner believed to be consistent with comparable companies.\nWe also have funding requirements with respect to our pension obligations. We expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. and foreign pension plans of approximately $2.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in 2019. Our minimum funding requirements after 2019 will depend on several factors, including the investment performance of our retirement plans and prevailing interest rates. Our funding obligations may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements. We also have payments due with respect to our postretirement benefit obligations. We do not prefund our postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect net other postretirement benefit payments to be approximately $2.5 million in 2019.\nWe may be required to make significant cash outlays due to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $9.6 million as of December 31, 2018 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nExcluded from the contractual obligations table above are open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018 for raw materials, supplies and capital expenditures in the normal course of business, supply contracts with customers, distribution agreements, joint venture agreements and other contracts without express funding requirements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating our business, management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our operating performance. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 because similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in our financing arrangements; \n \u2022 in developing our internal budgets and forecasts; \n \u2022 as a significant factor in evaluating our management for compensation purposes; \n \u2022 in evaluating potential acquisitions; \n \u2022 in comparing our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry; and \n \u2022 in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board of directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management in their assessments of performance and in forecasting and budgeting for our company. \nIn addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization (or EBITDA\u201d), as adjusted for items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring costs, impairment charges, non-cash fair value adjustments and acquisition related costs.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measurements recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not as alternatives for, net income (loss), operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n \u2022 they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 they do not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments under our ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes; \n \u2022 they do not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently and, as the number of differences in the way companies calculate these measures increases, the degree of their usefulness as a comparative measure correspondingly decreases.

Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nWe design, manufacture and sell sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer and anti-vibration systems for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks manufactured by global OEMs. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the anti-vibration systems product line. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. In 2018, approximately 85% of our sales consisted of original equipment sold directly to OEMs for installation on new vehicles. The remaining 15% of our sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II suppliers and non-automotive manufacturers. Accordingly, sales of our products are directly affected by the annual vehicle production of OEMs and, in particular, the production levels of the vehicles for which we provide specific parts. Most of our products are custom designed and engineered for a specific vehicle platform. Our sales and product development personnel frequently work directly with the OEMs' engineering departments in the design and development of our various products.\nAlthough each OEM may emphasize different requirements as the primary criteria for judging its suppliers, we believe success as an automotive supplier generally requires outstanding performance with respect to quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and an extensive global footprint. Also, we believe our continued commitment to invest in global common processes is an important factor in servicing global customers with the same quality and consistency of product wherever we produce in the world. This is especially important when supplying products for global platforms.\nIn addition, to remain competitive and offset continued customer pricing pressure, we must also consistently achieve and sustain cost savings. In an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure, we run a global continuous improvement program which includes training for our employees, as well as implementation of lean tools, structured problem solving, best business practices, standardized processes and change management. We also evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities and to relocate certain operations to lower cost countries. We believe we will continue to be successful in our efforts to improve our design and engineering capability and manufacturing processes while achieving cost savings, including through our continuous improvement initiatives.\nOur OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.\nIn 2018, approximately 53% of our sales were generated in North America. Because of our significant international operations, we are subject to the risks associated with doing business in other countries, such as currency volatility, high interest and inflation rates, and the general political and economic risk that are associated with some of these markets.\nRecent Trends and Conditions\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Outlook\nThe global automotive industry is susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. Business conditions may vary significantly from period to period or region to region.\nIn North America in 2019, growth is expected to continue, albeit at a more modest rate. Rising interest rates and continued uncertainty regarding global trade relationships, among other factors, could dampen economic momentum. Modest economic growth is also expected to continue in Canada and Mexico in 2019. The mix of vehicles produced and sold in the region continues to shift away from passenger cars in favor of crossover utility vehicles and light trucks.\nIn Europe, economic expansion continued in 2018 although momentum slowed in the second half of the year. Geopolitical concerns and the implementation of new environmental regulations in the automotive industry likely contributed to the slow-down. Looking ahead, we expect financial pressures in Italy, the continuation of global trade tensions and Britain's pending separation from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) will challenge the regional economic outlook in 2019.\nThe Chinese government continues to manage the nation's economy with a goal of sustaining growth. The growth target for 2018 was approximately 6.5%. For 2019, the official target will likely be somewhat lower as rising debt, inflation and uncertainty are pressuring consumption and continuing tension within U.S.-China trade relationships is driving exports lower. Fiscal tools such as increased investment in infrastructure may be used to in order to meet government growth targets.\nThe Brazilian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2018. Stronger economic growth is forecasted in 2019 due to an improving labor market, rising credit growth and market-friendly government agenda. Based on this, our near-term outlook for South America is positive. We remain cautious for the mid to long-term outlook, however, given the long history of political instability and economic volatility in the region.\nThe current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of previously-announced tariffs; however we anticipate these and other tariffs to negatively impact material costs.\nRaw Materials\nOur business is susceptible to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. Costs related to raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and oil and oil-derived commodities, continue to be volatile. In addition, we expect commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and operating cash flows. As such, on an ongoing basis, we work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures.\nProduction Levels\nOur business is directly affected by the automotive vehicle production rates in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. New vehicle demand is driven by macroeconomic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. The industry could face uncertainties that may adversely impact consumer demand for vehicles as well as the future production environment.\nAccording to the forecasting firm IHS Markit, global light vehicle production was approximately 94 million units in 2018. This reflects a decline of approximately 1.0% globally.\nDetails on light vehicle production in certain regions for 2018 and 2017, as well as projections for 2019, are provided in the following table:\n\n(1) Production data based on IHS Automotive, January 2019.\n(2) Includes Greater China units of 27.4, 27.0, and 28.0 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe anticipate that light vehicle production in North America and Europe will remain relatively stable over the next few years. In South America, we anticipate light vehicle production to be relatively strong in the near-term, but we remain cautious due to potential geo-political instability in the region.\nIndustry Overview\nCompetition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. Because of a growing emphasis on global vehicle platforms, automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will typically have a competitive advantage over smaller, regional competitors. This dynamic is likely to result in further consolidation of competing suppliers within our industry over time.\nOEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy.\nIncreased competitiveness in the industry, as well as customer focus on costs, has resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price reductions, reducing the overall profitability of the industry. Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continue to put additional pressures on the supply chain. These pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.\nIn addition to the above, other factors will present opportunities for automotive suppliers who are positioned for the changing environment, including autonomous and connected vehicles, evolving government regulation, and consumer preference for environmentally friendly products and technology, including hybrid and electric vehicle architectures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. These policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments that management makes in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if (i) it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and (ii) changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected could have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Such critical accounting estimates are discussed below. For these, materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions. Other items in our consolidated financial statements require estimation, however, in our judgment, they are not as critical as those discussed below.\nAcquisitions. Upon successful consummation of our 2018 acquisitions, we were subject to the accounting guidance as prescribed by ASC 805 - Business Combinations. We were required to allocate the purchase price of the acquired businesses to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on fair value. The excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with regard to intangible assets, requires significant levels of estimates and assumptions made by management. In order to assist management, we utilized third party valuation experts in determining the fair values.\nGoodwill. Our goodwill is tested for impairment as of October 1 of each year for all of our reporting units, and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review. For our goodwill analysis, fair values are based on the cash flows projected in the reporting units' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, discounted at a risk-adjusted rate of return. Our long-range planning forecasts are based on our assessment of revenue growth rates generally based on industry specific data, external vehicle build assumptions published by widely used external sources, and customer market share data based on known and targeted awards over a five-year period. The projected profit margin assumptions included in the plans are based on the current cost structure and adjustments for anticipated cost reductions or increases. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related cash flows used in measuring fair value could be different and impairment of goodwill might be recorded. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair values using market based multiples of comparable companies. In contemplation of our annual impairment analysis, we noted potential adverse changes in operating conditions. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2018 resulted in impairment for the Europe and Asia Pacific segments. The annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2017 resulted in no impairment. See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nLong-Lived Assets. We monitor our long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis. If impairment indicators exist, we analyze the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets compared to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon either a discounted cash flow analysis or estimated salvage values. Cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, as well as assumptions related to discount rates. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of long-lived assets. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed an impairment analysis of our long-lived assets based on changes in economic and operating conditions. Due to the deterioration of financial results, the analysis resulted in impairment at various locations in our Europe and Asia Pacific segments. See Note 8. Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nRestructuring. Specific accruals have been recorded in connection with restructuring initiatives. These accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities and contractual obligations. Actual amounts recognized could differ from the original estimates. Restructuring-related reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and changes to plans are appropriately recognized when identified. Changes to plans associated with the restructuring of existing businesses are generally recognized as employee separation and plant phase-out costs in the period the change occurs. See Note 7. Restructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Commitments. We generally enter into agreements with customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle's life. Although such contracts do not usually include minimum quantities, fulfillment of customers' purchasing requirements can be our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements generally may be terminated by our customer at any time, but such cancellations have historically been minimal. In limited cases, we may be committed to supply products at selling prices that do not cover our costs. In such situations, we recognize losses as they are incurred.\nWe receive blanket purchase orders from many customers annually. Generally, such purchase orders and related documents establish the annual terms, including pricing, related to a vehicle model. However, purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. We recognize revenue based on a point in time, generally when products are shipped or delivered to customers. As part of certain agreements, customers ask for cost reductions. We accrue for such concessions by reducing revenue as products are shipped. We also generally have ongoing adjustments to customer pricing arrangements based on the content and cost of our products. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with customers.\nIncome Taxes. In determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes, we make estimates and judgments which affect our evaluation of the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as well as our calculation of certain tax liabilities. We evaluate the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, expectations for future pretax operating income, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nConcluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize three years' cumulative pre-tax book results adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of cumulative results in recent years. In certain foreign jurisdictions, our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis. This is considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome. However, the three-year loss position is not solely determinative, and, accordingly, management considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based upon this analysis, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized in the future. Accordingly, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets. However, since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be\nmaterially different from our estimated liabilities. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Included in our results of operations are significant pension and postretirement benefit costs, which are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality rates, expected returns on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are determined as of the current year measurement date. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Our net pension and postretirement benefit costs were approximately $6.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo develop the discount rate for each pension plan, the expected cash flows underlying the plan's benefit obligations were discounted using a December 31, 2018 pension index to determine a single equivalent rate. To develop our expected return on plan assets, we considered historical long-term asset return experience, the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long-term investment returns. To develop our portfolio of plan assets, we considered the duration of the plan liabilities and gave more weight to equity positions, including both public and private equity investments, than to fixed-income securities.\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine pension benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nThe sensitivity of our pension cost and obligations to changes in key assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, is as follows:\n\nAggregate pension net periodic benefit cost is forecasted to be approximately $7.9 million in 2019.\nHealth care cost trend rates are assumed to reflect market trend, actual experience and future expectations. Health care cost trend rate assumptions used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nThe sensitivity of our postretirement benefit cost and obligations to changes in the health care cost trend rate is as follows:\n\nAggregate other postretirement net periodic benefit is forecasted to be approximately $0.4 million in 2019.\nThe Company's policy is to fund pension plans such that sufficient assets will be available to meet future benefit requirements and contribute amounts deductible for United States federal income tax purposes or amounts required by local statute. During 2018, the Company made a discretionary contribution of $15.0 million to its U.S. pension plan. The Company estimates it will make funding cash contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans of approximately $2.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively in 2019.\nThe Company does not prefund its postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect net other postretirement benefit payments to be approximately $2.5 million in 2019.\nResults of Operations\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017.\nSales\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 0.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n* Net of customer price reductions\n** Other includes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures\nGross Profit\n\n* Net of customer price reductions\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $129.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 51% of total cost of products sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Cost of products sold was impacted by vehicle production mix, commodity price and foreign exchange pressures, as well as acquisitions. These items were partially offset by continuous improvement, restructuring savings and material cost reductions.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $117.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 15.3% and 18.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in margin was driven by unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressures and foreign exchange, partially offset by net favorable operational performance and acquisitions.\nSelling, Administration and Engineering. Selling, administration and engineering expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $314.8 million, or 8.7% of sales, compared to $341.0 million, or 9.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Selling, administration and engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were favorable as a result of lower compensation-related costs and efficiencies related to cost improvement initiatives, partially offset by wage inflation.\nImpairment Charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $45.3 million of goodwill impairment charges, $42.9 million of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and $0.8 million of intangible impairment charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $4.3 million related to our decision to divest two of our inactive European sites, and $10.5 million related to the deterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities, two of our European locations and one of our North American locations.\nRestructuring. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $5.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses of $8.1 million related to the substantial completion of our European initiatives, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the Asia Pacific segment.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $1.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in March 2018.\nLoss on Refinancing and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, which resulted from the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in March 2018.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $10.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost and foreign currency losses in the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.7 million on earnings before taxes of $74.9 million. This compares to income tax expense of $74.5 million on earnings before taxes of $213.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit in 2018 differed from the statutory rate due to the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against net operating loss carryforwards and other timing items in France, in addition to a capital loss carryforward in the U.S. Additional items impacting income taxes were a discrete benefit resulting from the finalization of U.S. tax reform calculations, the mix of income between the U.S. and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items. Tax expense in 2017 differed from the statutory rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, the mix of income between the U.S. and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.\nSales\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 4.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\n* Net of customer price reductions\n** Other includes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures\nGross Profit\n\n* Net of customer price reductions\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $138.6 million or 4.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately 51% of total cost of products sold for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cost of products sold was impacted by higher production volumes, commodity price and foreign exchange pressures, as well as our acquisitions. These items were partially offset by continuous improvement, restructuring savings and material cost reductions.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 18.6% and 19.1% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in margin was driven by unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressures and foreign exchange, partially offset by net favorable operational performance and acquisitions.\nSelling, Administration and Engineering. Selling, administration and engineering expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $341.0 million or 9.4% of sales compared to $356.6 million, or 10.3%, of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, administration and engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were favorable as a result of lower compensation-related costs, partially offset by investment for growth and innovation.\nImpairment Charges. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $4.3 million related to our decision to divest two of our inactive European sites, and $10.5 million related to the\ndeterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities, two of our European locations and one of our North American locations. Non-cash asset impairment charges of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the deterioration of financial results at one of our Asia Pacific facilities.\nRestructuring. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses of $16.1 million related to the substantial completion of our European initiatives, partially offset by higher restructuring charges of $5.2 million in other regions.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted primarily from higher interest rates related to the Senior Notes.\nLoss on Refinancing and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million, which resulted from the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility in May 2017.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the reclassification of components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost and foreign currency losses, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of underwriting fees related to the secondary offering of $5.9 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016 and other miscellaneous income recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $74.5 million on earnings before taxes of $213.1 million. This compares to income tax expense of $54.3 million on earnings before taxes of $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tax expense in 2017 and 2016 differed from the statutory rate due to a charge of $33.5 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, the mix of income between the United States and foreign sources, tax incentives, incremental valuation allowance recorded on tax losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, other tax credits, and other nonrecurring discrete items.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company operates in four reportable segments: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment profit before tax. The results of each segment include certain allocations for general, administrative, interest, and other shared costs. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nThe following tables presents sales and segment profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSales \n* Net of customer price reductions\n \u2022 The impact of foreign currency exchange primarily related to the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and the Brazilian Real. \n \u2022 Other includes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. \nSegment profit (loss)\n\n* Net of customer price reductions\n \u2022 Volume / Mix includes changes in vehicle production volumes and shifts in consumer demand for specific vehicles particularly in Europe and China. \n \u2022 The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange was primarily driven by the Euro and Chinese Renminbi, partially offset by the Polish Zloty, the Czech Koruna and the Brazilian Real. \n \u2022 The Cost (Increases) / Decreases category above includes: \n \u25e6 The increase in material cost pressure and wage inflation; \n \u25e6 Net operational efficiencies of $80.2 million primarily driven by our North America and Europe segments; and \n \u25e6 The decrease in selling, administrative and engineering expense, due to lower compensation-related costs and efficiencies related to cost improvement initiatives. \n \u2022 The Other category above includes changes in the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, minority interest, restructuring expense and non-recurring items, including: \n \u25e6 The $74.2 million increase in impairment charges: $38.9 million in the Asia Pacific segment, $37.2 million in the Europe segment, partially offset by the non-recurrence of prior period charges of $1.9 million in the North America segment; and \n \u25e6 The gain of $10.4 million related to the sale of land in our Europe segment in 2018; \n \u25e6 The non-recurrence of the prior period pension settlement charges of $5.9 million in our Europe segment and the foreign tax amnesty program expense of $4.6 million in our South America segment; \n \u25e6 The $5.4 million decrease in restructuring expenses primarily related to our Europe segment, partially offset by an increase in the Asia Pacific segment. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nSales \n* Net of customer price reductions\n \u2022 The impact of foreign currency exchange primarily related to the Euro, the Brazilian Real and the Chinese Renminbi. \n \u2022 Other includes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 10. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for a detailed discussion of terms and conditions related to our debt.\nBased on our current and anticipated levels of operations and the condition in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our ABL Facility and receivables factoring will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations under our ABL Facility, depend on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry, financial and economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower inflow was primarily driven by changes in the utilization of the accounts receivable factoring program, lower cash earnings, changes in compensation-related accruals, and our discretionary pension contribution.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $365.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by an increase in receivables due to growth, increased inventory, higher payments related to incentive compensation, increased liabilities related to our factoring arrangement and higher cash paid for interest, partially offset by increased cash earnings and reduced cash paid for restructuring and taxes.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $383.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending on programs related to sales growth and innovation, and cash paid for the acquisition of businesses, which consisted primarily of $92.7 million for the Lauren acquisition and $42.3 million for the Hutchings acquisition, partially offset by land sale proceeds. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $180 million to $190 million on capital expenditures in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending, partially offset by lower cash spent for acquisitions of business.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher borrowings of short-term debt and lower principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by repurchase activity under our share repurchase program.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased repurchase activity under our share repurchase program and certain paydowns of foreign bank loans in 2017, partially offset by an increase in short-term debt.\nSenior Notes\nOn November 2, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CSA U.S. (the Issuer\u201d) completed a private offering of debt securities consisting of the issuance of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% notes due 2026 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay the non-extended term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the refinancing. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, as well as each of CSA U.S.'s wholly-owned existing or subsequently organized U.S. subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to the extent such subsidiary guarantees the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Notes at various points in time prior to maturity, as described in the indenture. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2026. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nIf a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture) occurs, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nABL Facility\nOn November 2, 2016, CS Intermediate Holdco 1 LLC ( Parent\u201d), CSA U.S. (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Cooper-Standard Automotive International Holdings B.V. (the Dutch Borrower\u201d, and, together with the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower, the Borrowers\u201d) and certain subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower, entered into a third amendment of our ABL Facility. Pursuant to the ABL Facility agreement, as amended, we have an aggregate revolving loan availability of up to $210.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability. In addition, our ABL Facility provides for an uncommitted $100.0 million incremental loan facility, for a potential total ABL Facility of $310.0 million. Any borrowings under our ABL Facility will mature, and the commitments of the lenders under our ABL Facility will terminate, on November 2, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility includes affirmative and negative covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations. The ABL Facility also contains various events of default that are customary for comparable facilities.\nLoan and letter of credit availability under the agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which at any time is limited to the lesser of: (A) the maximum facility amount (subject to certain adjustments) and (B) (i) up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable; plus (ii) the lesser of 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory; plus (iii) up to the lesser of $30.0 million and 75% of eligible tooling accounts receivable; minus reserves established by the agent. The obligations under the ABL Facility and the related guarantees are secured by various assets, as detailed in Note 10. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrowers' option:\n \u2022 in the case of borrowings by U.S. Borrower, London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or \n \u2022 in the case of borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, bankers' acceptance ( BA\u201d) rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or \n \u2022 in the case of borrowings by the Dutch Borrower, LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin may vary between 1.25% and 1.75% with respect to the LIBOR or Canadian BA rate-based borrowings and between 0.25% and 0.75% with respect to U.S. base rate, Canadian prime rate and Canadian base rate borrowings. The applicable margin is subject, in each case, to quarterly pricing adjustments (based on average facility availability).\nAs of December 31, 2018, $50.0 million was drawn under the ABL Facility, and subject to borrowing base availability, the Company had $155.1 million in availability, less outstanding letters of credit of $10.8 million. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs.\nTerm Loan Facility - Amendments\nOn November 2, 2016, CSA U.S., as borrower, entered into the first amendment of our Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of $340.0 million. Subject to certain conditions, the Term Loan Facility, without the consent of the then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), may be expanded (or a new term loan or revolving facility added) by an amount that will not cause the consolidated secured net debt ratio to exceed 2.25 to 1.00, plus $400.0 million, plus any voluntary prepayments (including revolving facility and ABL Facility to the extent commitments are reduced) not funded from proceeds of long-term indebtedness. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 2, 2023, unless earlier terminated.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains incurrence-based negative covenants customary for high yield senior secured debt securities. These negative covenants are subject to exceptions, qualifications and certain carveouts.\nOn May 2, 2017, CSA U.S. entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Loan Facility to modify the interest rate. Subsequently, on March 6, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Term Loan Facility to further modify the interest rate. In accordance with this amendment, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (1) with respect to Eurodollar rate loans, the greater of the applicable Eurodollar rate and 0.75% plus 2.0% per annum, or (2) with respect to base rate loans, the base rate, (which is the highest of the then current federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under the term loan, and the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus 1.0% per annum. As a result of the Amendment No. 3, the Company recognized a loss on refinancing and\nextinguishment of debt of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, which was due to the partial write off of new and unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount.\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by us and the wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries of CSA U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the principal amount of $333.2 million was outstanding, and the Company had $2.9 million unamortized debt issuance costs and $1.8 million of unamortized original issue discount.\nRepayment of the Term Loan Facility\nOn November 2, 2016, we repaid the non-extended term loan outstanding under the Term Loan Facility of $393.1 million. As a result of the repayment, the Company recognized a loss on refinancing of $5.1 million, which was primarily due to the write off of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. The Company used proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the non-extended term loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs a part of our working capital management, we sell certain accounts receivable through a third party financial institution in off-balance sheet arrangements. The amount sold varies each month based on the amount of underlying receivables and cash flow needs. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $100.4 million and $96.6 million, respectively, of receivables outstanding under receivable transfer agreements entered into by various locations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, total accounts receivable factored were $626.6 million and $544.1 million, respectively. Costs incurred on the sale of receivables were $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other expense, net and interest expense, net of interest income in the consolidated statements of net income. These are permitted transactions under the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Capital Transactions Impacting Liquidity\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program (the 2018 Program\u201d) authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the 2018 Program, repurchases may be made on the open market, through private transactions, accelerated share repurchases, round lot or block transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise, as determined by our management and in accordance with prevailing market conditions and federal securities laws and regulations. The 2018 Program was effective in November 2018. The common stock repurchase program approved in March 2016 was fully utilized as of December 31, 2018.\nIn March 2016, we purchased $23.8 million of our common stock (350,000 shares at $68.00 per share) from the Selling Stockholders (as described in Note 19. Equity\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report). In 2017, we repurchased $55.9 million of our common stock (513,801 shares at an average purchase price of $108.87 per share, excluding commissions) in the open market, of which $55.1 million was settled in cash during the year ended December 31, 2017. In June 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase our common stock. Under the ASR agreement, we made an up-front payment of $35.0 million. The repurchase was completed in the third quarter of 2018, and a total of 258,285 shares were repurchased at a weighted average purchase price of $135.51 per share. In addition to the repurchase under the ASR agreement, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 324,508 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $78.78 per share, excluding commissions, for a total cost of $25.6 million.\nWe expect to fund any future repurchases from cash on hand and future cash flows from operations. The specific timing and amount of repurchase will vary based on market and business conditions and other factors, including alternative uses of capital. We are not obligated to repurchase any number of shares or dollar amount, and the 2018 Program may be discontinued at any time at our discretion.\nSee Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\u201d and Note 19. Equity.\u201d\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the vendor to provide future goods or services. Except as otherwise disclosed, this table does not include information on our recurring purchase of materials for use in production because our raw materials purchase contracts typically do not require fixed or minimum quantities.\nThe following table summarizes the total amounts due as of December 31, 2018 under all debt agreements at nominal value, undiscounted capital lease commitments and other contractual obligations.\n\nIn addition to our contractual obligations and commitments set forth in the table above, we have employment arrangements with certain key executives that provide for continuity of management. These arrangements include payments of multiples of annual salary, certain incentives and continuation of benefits upon the occurrence of specified events in a manner believed to be consistent with comparable companies.\nWe also have funding requirements with respect to our pension obligations. We expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. and foreign pension plans of approximately $2.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in 2019. Our minimum funding requirements after 2019 will depend on several factors, including the investment performance of our retirement plans and prevailing interest rates. Our funding obligations may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements. We also have payments due with respect to our postretirement benefit obligations. We do not prefund our postretirement benefit obligations. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. We expect net other postretirement benefit payments to be approximately $2.5 million in 2019.\nWe may be required to make significant cash outlays due to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $9.6 million as of December 31, 2018 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information.\nExcluded from the contractual obligations table above are open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018 for raw materials, supplies and capital expenditures in the normal course of business, supply contracts with customers, distribution agreements, joint venture agreements and other contracts without express funding requirements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating our business, management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our operating performance. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 because similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in our financing arrangements; \n \u2022 in developing our internal budgets and forecasts; \n \u2022 as a significant factor in evaluating our management for compensation purposes; \n \u2022 in evaluating potential acquisitions; \n \u2022 in comparing our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry; and \n \u2022 in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board of directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management in their assessments of performance and in forecasting and budgeting for our company. \nIn addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization (or EBITDA\u201d), as adjusted for items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring costs, impairment charges, non-cash fair value adjustments and acquisition related costs.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measurements recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not as alternatives for, net income (loss), operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n \u2022 they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 they do not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments under our ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes; \n \u2022 they do not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently and, as the number of differences in the way companies calculate these measures increases, the degree of their usefulness as a comparative measure correspondingly decreases.  In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, it should be noted that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the below presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by special items.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income, which is the most comparable financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP:\n\n (1) Other non-cash impairment charges in 2018 related to intangible assets of $791 and fixed assets of $42,915. Impairment charges in 2017 and 2016 related to fixed assets of $14,763 and $1,273, respectively. \n (2) Non-cash goodwill impairment charges in 2018 related to impairments at our Europe and Asia Pacific reporting units, net of approximately $5,463 attributable to our noncontrolling interests. \n (3) Includes non-cash impairment charges related to restructuring. \n (4) Gain on sale of land in Europe that was contemplated in conjunction with our restructuring plan. See Note 7. Restructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report for additional information. \n (5) Project costs related to acquisitions and planned divestiture. \n (6) Amortization of write-up of inventory to fair value for the 2018 acquisitions. \n (7) Non-cash settlement charges incurred related to certain of our non-U.S. pension plans. \n (8) Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt relating to the March 2018 amendment and May 2017 amendment of the Term Loan Facility and the refinancing of our Term Loan Facility in 2016. \n (9) Relates to indirect taxes recorded in cost of products sold. \n (10) Fees and other expenses associated with the March 2016 secondary offering. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3.

report:\n\nOverview\n- Sales in 2018 were $3.6 billion, up slightly from 2017. Net income declined to $107.8 million from $135.3 million in 2017.\n\n- Operating performance declined significantly in 2018 due to unfavorable vehicle production mix, customer price reductions, commodity cost pressures, and foreign exchange, partially offset by operational efficiencies.\n\n- Impairment charges of $89 million were recorded in 2018 related to goodwill, intangibles and fixed assets. \n\nLiquidity\n- Operating cash flows were $149 million in 2018 compared to $313 million in 2017, primarily due to lower earnings, pension contributions, and changes in working capital.\n\n- The company amended its Term Loan facility in 2018 to reduce borrowing costs. Total debt outstanding was $831 million. \n\n- A $150 million share repurchase program was initiated in 2018. $60.6 million of shares were repurchased.\n\nSegments\n- Sales and profits declined in Europe and Asia Pacific segments in 2018, while the North America segment was flat. Impairments and restructuring costs impacted results.\n\n- Outlook for 2019 is continued modest growth in North America, stability in Europe, and higher production in Asia Pacific and South America.\n\nKey challenges ahead include uncertain economic conditions, commodity cost volatility, consumer preference shifts, and industry consolidation pressures."}
