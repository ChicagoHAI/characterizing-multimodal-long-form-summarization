Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOverview\nThe Company is an oil and gas exploration, development and production company, which is primarily in the business of drilling and operating oil and gas wells. From 2009 to 2020, the Company had pursued the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the Concession - Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea, containing a total of approximately 1.4 million acres. However, in January 2020, the Company abandoned the Concessions.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which provided a purchase price of $900,000. The Company raised approximately $2.05 million on March 26, 2021 through the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants.\nThe purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nWe have commenced rework of the existing production wells immediately after the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals and gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not yet conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties, while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe may find it necessary to obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the exploration and development of the Properties enumerated above, as well as to satisfy our existing debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to fund our planned development of the Properties.\nName Change and Reincorporation Matters\nAt the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 13, 2021, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, changing the Company's name to American Noble Gas, Inc. The stockholders also approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, removing the provision providing that any action taken by the stockholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting requires that all of the Company's stockholders entitled to vote on such action consent in writing thereto. Finally, the stockholders approved the 2021 Plan and we reserved 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nReincorporation in Nevada\nOn December 7, 2021, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Predecessor merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, AMGAS-Nevada with AMGAS-Nevada continuing as the surviving corporation. In conjunction with the merger, AMGAS-Nevada succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor existing immediately prior to the merger. The merger was consummated by the filing of a Certificate of Merger on December 7, 2021 with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The Agreement and Plan of Merger and transactions contemplated thereby were adopted by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Predecessor's Common Stock and/or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted common stock basis, by written consent in lieu of a special meeting of stockholders, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, (i) each outstanding share of the Predecessor's common stock automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMGAS-Nevada, (ii) each outstanding share of the Predecessor's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMGAS-Nevada, and (iii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of the Predecessor common stock converted into an option, right or warrant to acquire an equal number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock under the same terms and conditions as the original options, rights or warrants.\nSimilar to the shares of common stock of the Predecessor prior to the merger, the shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock are quoted on the OTCQB tier operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol IFNY\u201d. In accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each outstanding certificate previously representing shares of the Predecessor's common stock or Series A Preferred Stock automatically represents, without any action of the Predecessor's stockholders, the same number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the directors and officers of the Predecessor immediately prior to the merger became the directors and officers of AMGAS-Nevada and continued their respective directorship or services with the Company on the same terms as their respective directorship or services with the Predecessor immediately prior to the merger.\nAs a result of the merger, the internal affairs of the Company ceased to be subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law or governed by the Predecessor's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws. As of the December 7, 2021, effective date of the merger, the Company is now subject to the Nevada Revised Statutes and is governed by the Company's Articles of Incorporation.\nAll references to the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to the Predecessor prior to the merger, and AMGAS-Nevada subsequent to the merger.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2021. Economies throughout the world have been and continue to be disrupted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent rise of the new Omicron variant. In particular, the oil and gas market has been severely adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic because of the substantial and abrupt decrease in the demand for oil and gas globally followed by the recent resurgence in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, the capital markets have experienced periods of disruption and our efforts to raise necessary capital in the future may be adversely impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and investor sentiment and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the lingering uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our discussion of our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCorporate Activities\nThe Company's 2021 operating objectives have focused on: 1) raising the necessary funds to complete the acquisition of the Properties, 2) completing the acquisition of the Properties, 3) commencing rework on the Properties, including testing and evaluation of noble gas reserves in additional to the oil and gas producing zones and 4) resolving obligations in default and/or past due.\nRecent financings -\nIssuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock - On March 26, 2021, the Company issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with an aggregate principal face amount of up to approximately $2,500,000 subject to a 10% original issue discount.

The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $22,956, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAcquisition of Oil and Gas Properties -\nOn July 31, 2019, we acquired the Option from Core to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for the Properties. We paid a non-refundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the Option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the Option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the Option. The newly acquired option, however, now permits the Company to purchase the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company has agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2 to $10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020, the parties executed the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, which extended the new option to January 11, 2021, which has expired.\nWe, Core, and Seller entered into the Side Letters on September 2, 2020 and March 31, 2021, pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date of the acquisition of the Properties under the Asset Purchase Agreement to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, which provided a purchase price of $900,000.\nThe acquisition included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFollowing the acquisition, we have commenced rework of the existing production wells and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt, nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial conditions, changes in our financial conditions, or our results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Revenues totaled $79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had no revenues in 2020 as it focused on identification of acquisition targets of domestic oil and gas producing properties.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which provided a purchase price of $900,000. The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFollowing the acquisition, we have commenced rework of the existing production wells and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nOil and Gas Lease Operating Expenses\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Total oil and gas lease operating expenses totaled $530,118 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe commenced rework of the existing production wells on the Properties in order to restore the three producing wells to full operational condition. All such rework costs were expensed as routine maintenance instead of capitalized to oil and gas properties and equipment under the full-cost method. In addition, we have performed certain exploration, including testing and evaluation for the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nThe Company had no oil and gas lease operating expenses in 2020 as it held no oil and gas producing properties.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil resulting since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021, which was acquired for $900,000 cash plus the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $13,425. The Company allocated the purchase price of $913,425 to oil and gas properties and equipment, which is subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization as the acquisition qualified as an asset acquisition. Total depreciation, depletion and amortization was $92,502 for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no depreciation, depletion and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company held no properties for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCapitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. Under this method, the sum of the full cost pool, excluding the book value of unproved properties, and all estimated future development costs are divided by the total estimated quantities of proved reserves. This rate is applied to our total production for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the appropriate expense is recorded. Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas producing activities, as well as property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities, are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nAccretion of Asset Retirement Obligation\nTotal expense for the accretion of asset retirement obligations was $836 and $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company determined the amount of the asset retirement obligation assumed to be $13,425 as of April 1, 2021, the date of the acquisition of the Properties. The obligation relates to legal requirements associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisitions, construction, development, or normal use of the asset. The obligation relates primarily to the requirement to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and support wells at the conclusion of their useful lives.\nOil and Gas Production Related Taxes\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Oil and gas production related taxes totaled $1,060 and $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such taxes are deducted from gross oil and gas revenue by the crude oil purchaser upon payment to the Company and include primarily severance taxes imposed by the State of Kansas and Kansas conservation assessment fees. Revenues totaled $79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in the deduction of $1,060 in production related taxes. The Company has received notice of an exemption from the State of Kansas, which exempted the Company form paying severance taxes due to the existing wells production levels. Therefore, production related taxes should decline as a percentage of revenue in 2022 and beyond. The Company had no revenues in 2020 and therefore there was no deduction for production related taxes in Kansas.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther General and Administrative Expenses\nOther general and administrative expenses were $1,036,996 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $720,697, or 228%, from other general and administrative expenses of $316,299 for the year ended 2020. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of $314,643 in stock-based compensation due to the noncash compensation for its executives and Board members in 2021. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is also attributable to an increase $193,834 for legal fees, $37,705 for geological services and a $34,500 increase in auditor fees as the Company began operating the Properties, which required various capital raises and other filings with the SEC. In addition, the increase in other general and administrative expenses were attributable to the $75,000 charge-off of the option to acquire the Properties which expired, a $30,000 bonus paid to the Company's Chief Executive Officer attributable to his efforts in the acquisition of the Properties. The $314,643 increase in stock-based compensation was related to the amortization of the stock option grants in June 2021, the warrants issued to USNG and the Advisory Board, and the restricted stock grants in August 2020.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $108,052 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $210,931 for the in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decline of $102,879, or 49%. Interest expense declined during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the pay-off of the convertible note payable issued in August 2019, which had a stated principal balance of $365,169 and bore interest at an 8% rate until it was retired on March 26, 2021. The retirement of the two notes payable totaled $85,000 on April 1, 2021 and the August Note on March 31, 2021 resulted in less interest expense being reported during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company issued $28,665 principal balance of 3% Notes in connection with the Debt Settlement Agreements, which bear interest at 3%.

The 100,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $28,000 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. Accordingly, there was less interest related to these notes in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 30, 2021 and October 29, 2021, the Company entered into two Securities Purchase Agreements with one and three, respectively, accredited investors agreed for the 8% Notes, with an aggregate principal face amount of approximately $650,000. The 8% Notes are, subject to certain conditions, convertible into an aggregate of 1,300,000 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $0.50 per share. The Company also issued five and one half-year common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 1,850,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments which are immediately exercisable.

The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $32,274, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $35,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 100,000 shares of Common stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants which totaled $50,956 as of April 1, 2021. The 100,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $28,000 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $22,956, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of liabilities totaling $31,372, which was attributable to six transactions that extinguished outstanding liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Debt Settlement Agreements extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities with a total outstanding balance of $2,866,497, for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of the 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share, which was valued at $1,605,178, which resulted in a total gain of $1,232,654 of which $124,177 was reported as a gain on extinguishment of liabilities and $1,108,477 was reported as a capital contribution. The $23,000 gain from settlement of litigation extinguished $33,000 of trade payables for a cash payment of $10,000. The loss of $115,805 is related to the early retirement of $365,169 principal balance of August 2020 Note.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the gain on extinguishment of liabilities was attributable to two transactions that extinguished outstanding liabilities; (i) the SKM Exchange Agreement, which extinguished a promissory note with an outstanding principal balance of $1,000,000, $542,762 in accrued interest and other obligations previously outstanding and resulting in a total gain of $1,310,006, and (ii) the extinguishment of trade payable obligations totaling $4,840,136 that arose during 2013, which were extinguished in 2020 pursuant to the relevant statute of limitations.\nChange in Derivative Fair Value\nThe conversion feature in certain outstanding promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were treated as derivative instruments because such notes and warrants contained ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $199 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $795 during the year ended December 31, 2020. All short-term notes and their related derivative warrants have been terminated as of December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax\nThe Company recorded no income tax benefit (expense) in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company has been in a cumulative tax loss position and has substantial net operating loss carryforwards available for its utilization at December 31, 2021. The Company has continued to carry a 100% reserve on its net deferred tax assets and therefore recorded no income tax expense or benefit on its income (loss) before income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNet Income (Loss)\nThe Company reported a net loss of $1,603,761 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $5,623,707 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents a decrease of $7,227,468 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends\nThe Company recorded $174,449 and $-0- in convertible preferred stock dividends in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On March 26, 2021, the Company issued and classified its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as equity securities in the balance sheet. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock bears a cumulative dividend at a 10% rate based on its stated/liquidation value. There were no outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income (Loss) Applicable to Common Stockholders\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued on March 26, 2021 has a preference over Common Stock and therefore such accrued dividend amounts have been deducted from net income (loss) to report net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders of $(1,778,210) and $5,623,707 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders per Share\nBasic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and dilutive Common Stock Equivalents outstanding during the period. Common Stock Equivalents included in the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share computation represent shares of Common Stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of Convertible Promissory Notes, Convertible Preferred Stock and the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and if converted\u201d method. For periods in which net losses attributable to common stockholders are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of Common Stock Equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect. In addition, in periods in which there is net income attributable to common stockholders and the effect of including Common Stock Equivalents in the diluted per share calculations would be anti-dilutive (such as when the conversion or exercise price of the common stock equivalents are higher than the average closing market price per share) such anti-dilutive Common Stock Equivalents would also be excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nThe Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021, therefore all Common Stock Equivalents were considered anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share computations. The basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share were $(0.09) for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the August Note were considered Common Stock equivalents and therefore the dilutive effect of such issuance was included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share. All shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible debt (other than the August Note) and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants were antidilutive, and, therefore, not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The basic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.39 and the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.36 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPotential Common Stock Equivalents as of December 31, 2021 totaled 27,728,864 shares of Common Stock, which included 1,357,330 shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Promissory Notes, 6,898,750 shares of Common Stock underlying the conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 17,580,784 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding warrants and 1,892,000 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding stock options.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern-\nWe have had a history of losses and have generated little or no operating revenues for a number of years, as we concentrated on the development of our Concessions, which was a long-term, high-risk/reward exploration project in an otherwise unproven part of the world. We abandoned the Concessions in early 2020 due to the challenging economic and political issues in Nicaragua and the oil and gas industry in general. We have been assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving the acquisition, exploration and development of gas and oil properties in the United States, including the possibility of acquiring businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil and gas in the United States. As a result, we completed the purchase of the Properties on April 1, 2021 and have commenced certain rework to the existing producing wells and intend to perform workovers and other develop activities on the Properties during 2022. We plan to evaluate the Properties for additional reserves of noble gases, which may change our development plans should we determine that reserves of noble gases exist on the Properties at commercial quantities. The planned development of the Properties will require us to raise additional capital to accomplish our operating plan, which cannot be assured. Historically, we financed our operations through the issuance of equity and various short and long-term debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide the holders with a level of equity participation.\nCapital Raised\nHistorically, we have raised funds through various equity and debt instruments through private transactions. The following summarizes the sources of significant liquidity raised during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital raised: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,929,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes with detachable common stock purchase warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>650,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of note payable-related party </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,579,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has been able to raise the liquidity during 2021 and 2020 through the issuance of debt and equity in private transactions with accredited investors. These financial instruments generally require the Company to register the Common Stock underlying the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the convertible notes, provide the holders with a right to participate in future capital raises and require their approval for the future issuance of securities at rates less than $0.50 per share. The holders have also agreed that the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the convertible promissory notes and the exercise of the underlying warrants are generally subject to beneficial ownership limitations such that each holder of the financial instruments individually may not convert the underlying Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible notes or exercise the underlying warrants to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in any of the holders individually being the beneficial owner in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election of the holders, 9.99%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise, which beneficial ownership limitation may be increased or decreased up to 9.99% upon notice to the Company, provided that any increase in such limitation will not be effective until 61 days following notice to the Company.\nWe will likely continue to issue such convertible instruments with detachable warrants to acquire Common Stock to fund our operational and capital expenditure plans for 2022.\nLetter of Engagement\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company engaged Univest to act as the exclusive financial advisor, and the lead underwriter in the Offering. The size of the Offering is expected to be between $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 upon closing of the Offering. The Public Offering Price will be determined by mutual agreement of the Company and Univest and will be determined at the signing of the final Underwriting Agreement, which will based on, among other things, market conditions at the time of the Offering.\nPursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, Univest will act as principal, or the representative of a number of broker-dealers that will offer the securities in a public offering. The Letter Of Engagement anticipates that Univest will receive a gross discount equal to eight percent (8%) of the Public Offering Price on each share of the securities being offered. Univest has agreed to negotiate in good faith with other underwriters who, acting severally, could contract to act as an underwriter in connection with the sale of the securities being offered. Univest will also have the right to re-offer all or any part of the securities being offered to other broker-dealers. Univest will be entitled to warrants to purchase common stock representing five percent (5%) of the amount of securities sold in the Offering with an exercise price determined to be 110% of the Public Offering Price.\nThe Company also agreed to reimburse Univest, at and out of the proceeds of the Offering closings, for all of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (including, but not limited to, travel, due diligence expenses, reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, roadshow and background check on the Company's principals) in connection with the performance of its services hereunder not to exceed an aggregate of $150,000. In addition, at the closing of the Offering, the Company agreed to reimburse Univest one percent (1%) of the actual amount of the Offering as nonaccountable expense of the offering.\nThe term of the Letter of Engagement expires upon the earlier to occur of (i) six (6) months from the date of execution or (ii) the mutual written agreement of the Company and Univest.\nCapital Expenditures\nAcquisition of the Oil and Gas Properties in Central Kansas Uplift - On July 31, 2019, we acquired the option from Core to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for the Properties. We paid a non-refundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the previous option. the newly acquired option, however, permits the Company to purchase the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2-10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020 the parties executed the Asset Purchase Agreement which extended the new option to January 11, 2021, which has expired.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe, Core, and Seller entered into the Side Letters on September 2, 2020 and March 31, 2021, pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date of the acquisition of the Properties under the Asset Purchase Agreement to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement for $900,000.\nThe purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFarmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field- On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% joint venture interest in the AMGAS JV that holds a Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney counties, Kansas.\nThe Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to begin in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout's existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout Agreement provides the JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices.\nThe AMGAS JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV plans to target brine with commercial quantities of bromine and iodine. AMGAS is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells.\nWe will likely find it necessary to obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field, as well as to satisfy our existing debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to fund our planned development of the Properties or the Hugoton Gas Field.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the future in order to fund the (i) development of the Properties acquired on April 1, 2021; (ii) to fund our exploration and development obligations under the Farmout Agreement in the Hugoton Gas Field; (iii) normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (iv) outstanding debt and other financial obligations including the payment of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock dividends and the repayment of the convertible notes payable as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial concerns that must be successfully addressed during 2022.\nThe Company has made substantial progress in resolving many of its existing financial obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In that regard, on March 31, 2021, the Company and six creditors entered into Debt Settlement Agreements, which extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling $2,866,497 in exchange for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share. On April 1, 2021, the Company and the holders of two notes payable that were in default reached a settlement whereby the Company issued a total of 245,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants which totaled $123,830 as of April 1, 2021. The Company has made substantial progress in resolving its financial obligations; however, there is in excess of $1.9 million of old unpaid accounts payable and accrued liabilities that the Company believes that it may not have to pay based on the relevant Statute of Limitations on repayment.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company will have significant financial commitments to execute its planned exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field. The Company may find it necessary to raise substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to fund such exploration and development activities and may seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the Properties in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such new funding or be able to reach agreements with industry operators and other third parties or on what terms.\nDue to the uncertainties related to the foregoing matters, our independent registered accounting firm has expressed the option that there exists substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financials are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nCash and cash equivalents balances-\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $260,590, an increase from a balance of $11,042 as of December 31, 2020.

The Company made payments totaling $14,000 and issued 15,000 shares of Common Stock during 2013. The Company contended that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contended that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of Common Stock in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company's contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The Company has accrued this amount in accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>On March 20, 2020, Ryan filed an action in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services Ryan alleged he performed for Social, Environmental and Economic Impact Assessments during July 2012 through September 2015 on the Concessions. Ryan alleged that such services were provided pursuant to oral agreements with the Company. Ryan claims breach of contract for failure to pay $12,000 amounts invoiced and due. On December 23, 2020, Ryan filed a motion for default judgment for $12,000 in unpaid invoices, plus legal, fees, statutory interest and any expert testimony fees. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit because the claims are barred by the statute of limitations and defective service. The Company has included the expected impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nUSNG Letter Agreement - The Company is required to pay USNG a $8,000 monthly cash fee beginning at the onset of commercial helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that AMGAS receives cash receipts in excess of $25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet achieved the $25,000 cash receipts threshold, therefore there has been no payment or accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision as of December 31, 2021. [The USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of 5 years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew.]\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFarmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% interest in the AMGAS JV that holds the Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout's existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the AMGAS JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. The first exploratory well is scheduled to commence in April 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with a goal to evaluate the first of two separate silty shale members of the Chase group of formations - the Gage Shale and the Holmesville Shale. These two shale members have not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the field.\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year; however, we do believe that inflation may significantly impact our business in 2022. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and fairly present our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following section identifies and summarizes those accounting policies considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 1 - Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for all relevant accounting policies.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we reduced our valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets by $736,000 while the valuation allowance remained at 100% of all net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We have incurred net taxable losses for 11 of the last 14 years and continue to be in a cumulative loss position at December 31, 2021. In addition, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financials are issued due to operational and financing uncertainties. Accordingly, we have determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in ASC 740. Therefore, we have determined to continue to provide a 100% valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed.\nFor income tax purposes, hawse have net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $62,990,000 as of December 31, 2021, which expire beginning in 2025 through 2041.\nWe have recently completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2020. Therefore, all such tax returns are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company's ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards in the event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Management has completed its review of whether such ownership changes have occurred, and based upon such review, management believes that the Company is not currently subject to an annual limitation or the possibility of the complete elimination of the net operating loss carry- forwards. In addition, the Company may be limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future\nTable 66: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives.\nThe estimated fair value of our derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the detachable warrants issued in connection with various notes payable, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of our Common Stock and interest rates. The detachable warrants issued in connection with the two short-term notes payable (See Note 3) contained full-ratchet, anti-dilution provisions that remain in effect during the term of the warrants while the ratchet and anti-dilution provisions of the other notes payable cease when the related note payable is extinguished. When the related notes payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions is extinguished, the derivative liability will be adjusted to fair value and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.\nOn April 1, 2021, the outstanding warrants treated as derivatives and the related notes payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions were extinguished through an exchange transaction as described in Note 3. Therefore, the derivative liability was adjusted to fair value and extinguished and included in the gain on extinguishment of notes payable as of the termination date (See Note 10).\nA comparison of the assumptions used in calculating estimated fair value of such derivative liabilities as of the April 1, 2021 termination date and December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nApril 1, 2021 (termination date)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Volatility - range </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>373.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual term </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 - 0.8 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exercise price </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Number of warrants in aggregate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of the derivative financial instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs for both open and closed derivatives:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized derivative gains included in other income/expense for the period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Extinguishment of derivative liability as part of the exchange of debt for common stock (See Notes 3 and 6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.

The Company has applied ASU-2020-06 to all outstanding financial instruments as of January 1, 2021, (the date of adoption of ASU 2020-06) and those entered into after January 1, 2021 including the 8% Notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, such convertible notes were required to be separated into their debt and equity components because of the issuance of detachable warrants together with the convertible notes. Accordingly, the Company allocated the proceeds of the 8% Notes as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds allocated to 8% Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds allocated to detachable warrants to purchase Common Stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total proceeds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>650,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 8% Notes issued in August 2021 (the August 8% Notes\u201d) and the 8% Notes issued in October 2021 (the October 8% Notes\u201d; collectively with the August 8% Notes, the 8% Notes\u201d)) were recorded at their par value less the discount established at their respective origination date. The note discount is amortized over the term of the convertible note utilizing the level-interest method.

When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern it should consider whether its plans to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of management's plans, the entity should disclose information that enables user of financial statements to understand the principal events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events, and management's plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe performed the analysis and our overall assessment was there were conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year, but such doubt was not adequately mitigated by our plans to address the substantial doubt as disclosed in Note 1: Going Concern.\nStock-based compensation\nWe grant share-based compensation awards in exchange for employee, director and consultant services, including a stock option plan, grants of restricted stock and common stock purchase warrants issued for services that vest over future periods considering the grantee remains as an employee or service provider to the Company. The fair value of awards granted under the plans are recognized in the Statements of Income (Loss) over the related service period. The fair values of stock options are estimated at the time of each grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair values of restricted stock grants are measured at each grant date using the closing market price on the day of grant. The fair value estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the Company's performance, and the Company's performance in relation to its peers.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOverview\nThe Company is an oil and gas exploration, development and production company, which is primarily in the business of drilling and operating oil and gas wells. From 2009 to 2020, the Company had pursued the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the Concession - Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea, containing a total of approximately 1.4 million acres. However, in January 2020, the Company abandoned the Concessions.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which provided a purchase price of $900,000. The Company raised approximately $2.05 million on March 26, 2021 through the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants.\nThe purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nWe have commenced rework of the existing production wells immediately after the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals and gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not yet conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties, while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\n 23 \nWe may find it necessary to obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the exploration and development of the Properties enumerated above, as well as to satisfy our existing debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to fund our planned development of the Properties.\nName Change and Reincorporation Matters\nAt the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 13, 2021, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, changing the Company's name to American Noble Gas, Inc. The stockholders also approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, removing the provision providing that any action taken by the stockholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting requires that all of the Company's stockholders entitled to vote on such action consent in writing thereto. Finally, the stockholders approved the 2021 Plan and we reserved 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nReincorporation in Nevada\nOn December 7, 2021, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Predecessor merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, AMGAS-Nevada with AMGAS-Nevada continuing as the surviving corporation. In conjunction with the merger, AMGAS-Nevada succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor existing immediately prior to the merger. The merger was consummated by the filing of a Certificate of Merger on December 7, 2021 with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The Agreement and Plan of Merger and transactions contemplated thereby were adopted by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Predecessor's Common Stock and/or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted common stock basis, by written consent in lieu of a special meeting of stockholders, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, (i) each outstanding share of the Predecessor's common stock automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMGAS-Nevada, (ii) each outstanding share of the Predecessor's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMGAS-Nevada, and (iii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of the Predecessor common stock converted into an option, right or warrant to acquire an equal number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock under the same terms and conditions as the original options, rights or warrants.\nSimilar to the shares of common stock of the Predecessor prior to the merger, the shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock are quoted on the OTCQB tier operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol IFNY\u201d. In accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each outstanding certificate previously representing shares of the Predecessor's common stock or Series A Preferred Stock automatically represents, without any action of the Predecessor's stockholders, the same number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the directors and officers of the Predecessor immediately prior to the merger became the directors and officers of AMGAS-Nevada and continued their respective directorship or services with the Company on the same terms as their respective directorship or services with the Predecessor immediately prior to the merger.\nAs a result of the merger, the internal affairs of the Company ceased to be subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law or governed by the Predecessor's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws. As of the December 7, 2021, effective date of the merger, the Company is now subject to the Nevada Revised Statutes and is governed by the Company's Articles of Incorporation.\nAll references to the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to the Predecessor prior to the merger, and AMGAS-Nevada subsequent to the merger.\n 24 \nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2021. Economies throughout the world have been and continue to be disrupted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent rise of the new Omicron variant. In particular, the oil and gas market has been severely adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic because of the substantial and abrupt decrease in the demand for oil and gas globally followed by the recent resurgence in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, the capital markets have experienced periods of disruption and our efforts to raise necessary capital in the future may be adversely impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and investor sentiment and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the lingering uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our discussion of our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCorporate Activities\nThe Company's 2021 operating objectives have focused on: 1) raising the necessary funds to complete the acquisition of the Properties, 2) completing the acquisition of the Properties, 3) commencing rework on the Properties, including testing and evaluation of noble gas reserves in additional to the oil and gas producing zones and 4) resolving obligations in default and/or past due.\nRecent financings -\nIssuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock - On March 26, 2021, the Company issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with an aggregate principal face amount of up to approximately $2,500,000 subject to a 10% original issue discount.

The holders were also granted demand registration rights. The Company also issued warrants along-side of the Convertible Preferred Stock investors to purchase up to 6,410,250 shares (assuming the $2.5 million offering is fully subscribed) of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.39 per share, subject to customary adjustments. The common stock purchase warrants are exercisable commencing six (6) months after issuance on a cashless basis at the holders' discretion with a term of five (5) years. On March 26, 2021, investors purchased Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with an aggregate cash purchase price of $2,050,000 together with warrants to purchase a total of 5,256,410 shares of Common Stock.\nNet proceeds from the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was $1,929,089 after deducting the placement agent fee and other expenses of the offering. The Company used the proceeds of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock offering to complete the acquisition and development of the Properties, to pay-off all outstanding convertible notes payable and for general working capital.\nIssuance of 8% Note with Detachable Warrants - On August 30, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with the 8% Note Investor for the Company's 8% Note, with an aggregate principal face amount of approximately $100,000.

The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $22,956, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAcquisition of Oil and Gas Properties -\nOn July 31, 2019, we acquired the Option from Core to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for the Properties. We paid a non-refundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the Option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the Option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the Option. The newly acquired option, however, now permits the Company to purchase the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company has agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2 to $10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020, the parties executed the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, which extended the new option to January 11, 2021, which has expired.\nWe, Core, and Seller entered into the Side Letters on September 2, 2020 and March 31, 2021, pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date of the acquisition of the Properties under the Asset Purchase Agreement to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.\n 27 \nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, which provided a purchase price of $900,000.\nThe acquisition included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFollowing the acquisition, we have commenced rework of the existing production wells and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt, nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial conditions, changes in our financial conditions, or our results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Revenues totaled $79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had no revenues in 2020 as it focused on identification of acquisition targets of domestic oil and gas producing properties.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which provided a purchase price of $900,000. The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFollowing the acquisition, we have commenced rework of the existing production wells and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nOil and Gas Lease Operating Expenses\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Total oil and gas lease operating expenses totaled $530,118 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n 28 \nWe commenced rework of the existing production wells on the Properties in order to restore the three producing wells to full operational condition. All such rework costs were expensed as routine maintenance instead of capitalized to oil and gas properties and equipment under the full-cost method. In addition, we have performed certain exploration, including testing and evaluation for the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nThe Company had no oil and gas lease operating expenses in 2020 as it held no oil and gas producing properties.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil resulting since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021, which was acquired for $900,000 cash plus the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $13,425. The Company allocated the purchase price of $913,425 to oil and gas properties and equipment, which is subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization as the acquisition qualified as an asset acquisition. Total depreciation, depletion and amortization was $92,502 for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no depreciation, depletion and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company held no properties for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCapitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. Under this method, the sum of the full cost pool, excluding the book value of unproved properties, and all estimated future development costs are divided by the total estimated quantities of proved reserves. This rate is applied to our total production for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the appropriate expense is recorded. Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas producing activities, as well as property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities, are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nAccretion of Asset Retirement Obligation\nTotal expense for the accretion of asset retirement obligations was $836 and $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company determined the amount of the asset retirement obligation assumed to be $13,425 as of April 1, 2021, the date of the acquisition of the Properties. The obligation relates to legal requirements associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisitions, construction, development, or normal use of the asset. The obligation relates primarily to the requirement to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and support wells at the conclusion of their useful lives.\nOil and Gas Production Related Taxes\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Oil and gas production related taxes totaled $1,060 and $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such taxes are deducted from gross oil and gas revenue by the crude oil purchaser upon payment to the Company and include primarily severance taxes imposed by the State of Kansas and Kansas conservation assessment fees. Revenues totaled $79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in the deduction of $1,060 in production related taxes. The Company has received notice of an exemption from the State of Kansas, which exempted the Company form paying severance taxes due to the existing wells production levels. Therefore, production related taxes should decline as a percentage of revenue in 2022 and beyond. The Company had no revenues in 2020 and therefore there was no deduction for production related taxes in Kansas.\n 29 \nOther General and Administrative Expenses\nOther general and administrative expenses were $1,036,996 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $720,697, or 228%, from other general and administrative expenses of $316,299 for the year ended 2020. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of $314,643 in stock-based compensation due to the noncash compensation for its executives and Board members in 2021. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is also attributable to an increase $193,834 for legal fees, $37,705 for geological services and a $34,500 increase in auditor fees as the Company began operating the Properties, which required various capital raises and other filings with the SEC. In addition, the increase in other general and administrative expenses were attributable to the $75,000 charge-off of the option to acquire the Properties which expired, a $30,000 bonus paid to the Company's Chief Executive Officer attributable to his efforts in the acquisition of the Properties. The $314,643 increase in stock-based compensation was related to the amortization of the stock option grants in June 2021, the warrants issued to USNG and the Advisory Board, and the restricted stock grants in August 2020.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $108,052 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $210,931 for the in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decline of $102,879, or 49%. Interest expense declined during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the pay-off of the convertible note payable issued in August 2019, which had a stated principal balance of $365,169 and bore interest at an 8% rate until it was retired on March 26, 2021. The retirement of the two notes payable totaled $85,000 on April 1, 2021 and the August Note on March 31, 2021 resulted in less interest expense being reported during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company issued $28,665 principal balance of 3% Notes in connection with the Debt Settlement Agreements, which bear interest at 3%. Interest expense totaled $643 related to these 3% Notes during the year ended December 31, 2021 and will continue to affect interest expense in future quarters.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $50,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 145,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants, which totaled $72,874 as of April 1, 2021. In addition, on April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $35,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 100,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants, which totaled $50,956 as of April 1, 2021. The 100,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $28,000 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. Accordingly, there was less interest related to these notes in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 30, 2021 and October 29, 2021, the Company entered into two Securities Purchase Agreements with one and three, respectively, accredited investors agreed for the 8% Notes, with an aggregate principal face amount of approximately $650,000. The 8% Notes are, subject to certain conditions, convertible into an aggregate of 1,300,000 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $0.50 per share. The Company also issued five and one half-year common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 1,850,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments which are immediately exercisable. The investors purchased the 8% Notes and the warrants from the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $650,000 and the proceeds were used for general working capital purposes. The 8% Notes bear interest at 8%, however a discount was recorded for the on the relative estimated fair value of the detachable warrants issued, which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 8% Notes using the interest method. Total interest expense was $62,170 during the year ended December 31, 2021 and will continue to affect interest expense in future quarters.\nGain on Extinguishment of Liabilities\nThe Company reported a gain on exchange and extinguishment of liabilities of $86,602 and $6,150,142 in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n 30 \nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $50,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 145,000 shares of Common stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants, which totaled $72,874 as of April 1, 2021. The 145,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $40,600 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $32,274, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $35,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 100,000 shares of Common stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants which totaled $50,956 as of April 1, 2021. The 100,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $28,000 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $22,956, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of liabilities totaling $31,372, which was attributable to six transactions that extinguished outstanding liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Debt Settlement Agreements extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities with a total outstanding balance of $2,866,497, for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of the 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share, which was valued at $1,605,178, which resulted in a total gain of $1,232,654 of which $124,177 was reported as a gain on extinguishment of liabilities and $1,108,477 was reported as a capital contribution. The $23,000 gain from settlement of litigation extinguished $33,000 of trade payables for a cash payment of $10,000. The loss of $115,805 is related to the early retirement of $365,169 principal balance of August 2020 Note.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the gain on extinguishment of liabilities was attributable to two transactions that extinguished outstanding liabilities; (i) the SKM Exchange Agreement, which extinguished a promissory note with an outstanding principal balance of $1,000,000, $542,762 in accrued interest and other obligations previously outstanding and resulting in a total gain of $1,310,006, and (ii) the extinguishment of trade payable obligations totaling $4,840,136 that arose during 2013, which were extinguished in 2020 pursuant to the relevant statute of limitations.\nChange in Derivative Fair Value\nThe conversion feature in certain outstanding promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were treated as derivative instruments because such notes and warrants contained ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $199 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $795 during the year ended December 31, 2020. All short-term notes and their related derivative warrants have been terminated as of December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax\nThe Company recorded no income tax benefit (expense) in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company has been in a cumulative tax loss position and has substantial net operating loss carryforwards available for its utilization at December 31, 2021. The Company has continued to carry a 100% reserve on its net deferred tax assets and therefore recorded no income tax expense or benefit on its income (loss) before income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNet Income (Loss)\nThe Company reported a net loss of $1,603,761 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $5,623,707 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents a decrease of $7,227,468 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n 31 \nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends\nThe Company recorded $174,449 and $-0- in convertible preferred stock dividends in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On March 26, 2021, the Company issued and classified its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as equity securities in the balance sheet. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock bears a cumulative dividend at a 10% rate based on its stated/liquidation value. There were no outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income (Loss) Applicable to Common Stockholders\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued on March 26, 2021 has a preference over Common Stock and therefore such accrued dividend amounts have been deducted from net income (loss) to report net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders of $(1,778,210) and $5,623,707 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders per Share\nBasic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and dilutive Common Stock Equivalents outstanding during the period. Common Stock Equivalents included in the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share computation represent shares of Common Stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of Convertible Promissory Notes, Convertible Preferred Stock and the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and if converted\u201d method. For periods in which net losses attributable to common stockholders are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of Common Stock Equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect. In addition, in periods in which there is net income attributable to common stockholders and the effect of including Common Stock Equivalents in the diluted per share calculations would be anti-dilutive (such as when the conversion or exercise price of the common stock equivalents are higher than the average closing market price per share) such anti-dilutive Common Stock Equivalents would also be excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nThe Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021, therefore all Common Stock Equivalents were considered anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share computations. The basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share were $(0.09) for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the August Note were considered Common Stock equivalents and therefore the dilutive effect of such issuance was included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share. All shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible debt (other than the August Note) and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants were antidilutive, and, therefore, not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The basic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.39 and the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.36 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPotential Common Stock Equivalents as of December 31, 2021 totaled 27,728,864 shares of Common Stock, which included 1,357,330 shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Promissory Notes, 6,898,750 shares of Common Stock underlying the conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 17,580,784 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding warrants and 1,892,000 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding stock options.\n 32 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern-\nWe have had a history of losses and have generated little or no operating revenues for a number of years, as we concentrated on the development of our Concessions, which was a long-term, high-risk/reward exploration project in an otherwise unproven part of the world. We abandoned the Concessions in early 2020 due to the challenging economic and political issues in Nicaragua and the oil and gas industry in general. We have been assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving the acquisition, exploration and development of gas and oil properties in the United States, including the possibility of acquiring businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil and gas in the United States. As a result, we completed the purchase of the Properties on April 1, 2021 and have commenced certain rework to the existing producing wells and intend to perform workovers and other develop activities on the Properties during 2022. We plan to evaluate the Properties for additional reserves of noble gases, which may change our development plans should we determine that reserves of noble gases exist on the Properties at commercial quantities. The planned development of the Properties will require us to raise additional capital to accomplish our operating plan, which cannot be assured. Historically, we financed our operations through the issuance of equity and various short and long-term debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide the holders with a level of equity participation.\nCapital Raised\nHistorically, we have raised funds through various equity and debt instruments through private transactions. The following summarizes the sources of significant liquidity raised during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital raised: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,929,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes with detachable common stock purchase warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>650,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of note payable-related party </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,579,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has been able to raise the liquidity during 2021 and 2020 through the issuance of debt and equity in private transactions with accredited investors. These financial instruments generally require the Company to register the Common Stock underlying the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the convertible notes, provide the holders with a right to participate in future capital raises and require their approval for the future issuance of securities at rates less than $0.50 per share. The holders have also agreed that the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the convertible promissory notes and the exercise of the underlying warrants are generally subject to beneficial ownership limitations such that each holder of the financial instruments individually may not convert the underlying Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible notes or exercise the underlying warrants to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in any of the holders individually being the beneficial owner in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election of the holders, 9.99%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise, which beneficial ownership limitation may be increased or decreased up to 9.99% upon notice to the Company, provided that any increase in such limitation will not be effective until 61 days following notice to the Company.\nWe will likely continue to issue such convertible instruments with detachable warrants to acquire Common Stock to fund our operational and capital expenditure plans for 2022.\nLetter of Engagement\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company engaged Univest to act as the exclusive financial advisor, and the lead underwriter in the Offering. The size of the Offering is expected to be between $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 upon closing of the Offering. The Public Offering Price will be determined by mutual agreement of the Company and Univest and will be determined at the signing of the final Underwriting Agreement, which will based on, among other things, market conditions at the time of the Offering.\nPursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, Univest will act as principal, or the representative of a number of broker-dealers that will offer the securities in a public offering. The Letter Of Engagement anticipates that Univest will receive a gross discount equal to eight percent (8%) of the Public Offering Price on each share of the securities being offered. Univest has agreed to negotiate in good faith with other underwriters who, acting severally, could contract to act as an underwriter in connection with the sale of the securities being offered. Univest will also have the right to re-offer all or any part of the securities being offered to other broker-dealers. Univest will be entitled to warrants to purchase common stock representing five percent (5%) of the amount of securities sold in the Offering with an exercise price determined to be 110% of the Public Offering Price.\nThe Company also agreed to reimburse Univest, at and out of the proceeds of the Offering closings, for all of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (including, but not limited to, travel, due diligence expenses, reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, roadshow and background check on the Company's principals) in connection with the performance of its services hereunder not to exceed an aggregate of $150,000. In addition, at the closing of the Offering, the Company agreed to reimburse Univest one percent (1%) of the actual amount of the Offering as nonaccountable expense of the offering.\nThe term of the Letter of Engagement expires upon the earlier to occur of (i) six (6) months from the date of execution or (ii) the mutual written agreement of the Company and Univest.\nCapital Expenditures\nAcquisition of the Oil and Gas Properties in Central Kansas Uplift - On July 31, 2019, we acquired the option from Core to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for the Properties. We paid a non-refundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the previous option. the newly acquired option, however, permits the Company to purchase the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2-10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020 the parties executed the Asset Purchase Agreement which extended the new option to January 11, 2021, which has expired.\n 33 \nWe, Core, and Seller entered into the Side Letters on September 2, 2020 and March 31, 2021, pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date of the acquisition of the Properties under the Asset Purchase Agreement to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement for $900,000.\nThe purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFarmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field- On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% joint venture interest in the AMGAS JV that holds a Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney counties, Kansas.\nThe Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to begin in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout's existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout Agreement provides the JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices.\nThe AMGAS JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV plans to target brine with commercial quantities of bromine and iodine. AMGAS is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells.\nWe will likely find it necessary to obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field, as well as to satisfy our existing debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to fund our planned development of the Properties or the Hugoton Gas Field.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the future in order to fund the (i) development of the Properties acquired on April 1, 2021; (ii) to fund our exploration and development obligations under the Farmout Agreement in the Hugoton Gas Field; (iii) normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (iv) outstanding debt and other financial obligations including the payment of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock dividends and the repayment of the convertible notes payable as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial concerns that must be successfully addressed during 2022.\nThe Company has made substantial progress in resolving many of its existing financial obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In that regard, on March 31, 2021, the Company and six creditors entered into Debt Settlement Agreements, which extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling $2,866,497 in exchange for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share. On April 1, 2021, the Company and the holders of two notes payable that were in default reached a settlement whereby the Company issued a total of 245,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants which totaled $123,830 as of April 1, 2021. The Company has made substantial progress in resolving its financial obligations; however, there is in excess of $1.9 million of old unpaid accounts payable and accrued liabilities that the Company believes that it may not have to pay based on the relevant Statute of Limitations on repayment.\n 34 \nThe Company will have significant financial commitments to execute its planned exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field. The Company may find it necessary to raise substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to fund such exploration and development activities and may seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the Properties in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such new funding or be able to reach agreements with industry operators and other third parties or on what terms.\nDue to the uncertainties related to the foregoing matters, our independent registered accounting firm has expressed the option that there exists substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financials are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nCash and cash equivalents balances-\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $260,590, an increase from a balance of $11,042 as of December 31, 2020. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the $249,548 net increase in cash during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n \u25cf Operating activities: $801,553 of net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $801,553 and $196,618 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a deterioration of $604,935. The [deterioration] was primarily the result of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The Company reported net income (loss) of $(1,603,761) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5,623,707 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We acquired the Properties in 2021 and have expended substantial amounts during 2021 on well workovers and exploration/evaluation of potential noble gas reserves on the Properties, which has contributed to the increased usage of cash flow in operating activities. \u25cf Investing activities: $900,000 of net cash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2020. We completed the acquisition of the Properties during 2021. \u25cf Financing activities: $1,951,101 of net cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,951,101 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $205,875 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company raised $1,929,089 through the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, raised $650,000 through the issuance of convertible promissory notes, repaid $453,539 of convertible notes payable and paid dividends of $174,449 during 2021. \nThe net result of these activities was a $249,548 increase in cash and cash equivalents from $11,042 as of December 31, 2020 to $260,590 as of December 31, 2021.\nCommitments:\nCapital Expenditures. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2021. The Farmout Agreement that we entered into in April 2022 required us to drill at least one production well in 2022. We expect to begin in April 2022 and estimate that the expenses related to the drilling program to be approximately $350,000 for drilling of the initial well.\n 35 \nRepayment of Debt. Debt obligations is comprised of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3% Convertible promissory notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>8% Convertible promissory notes payable (less discount of $494,861 and $-0- as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Convertible note payable, (less discount of $-0- and $231,606 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,563 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Note payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Note payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218,563 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Long-term portion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable, short-term </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,563 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt obligations become due and payable as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>Years ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal\nbalance due\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,139 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOpen Litigation.\nThe Company is subject to various claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming breach of contract due to the Company's failure to pay amounts due. The Company believes that it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial statements.\nThe Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:\n \u25cf In October 2012, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas, seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to other wells in Texas, to $45,103, which amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter. \n 36 \n Pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the State of Texas, the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter, who may be held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company. Therefore, to the extent liabilities might actually occur, these are the obligations of the Company. Management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000, calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 wells operated by Infinity Texas. Theses related liabilities, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, are included in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets. \u25cf On September 26, 2014, Cambrian filed an action in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality control and management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the Concessions. Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a master consulting agreement with the Company, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle the default judgment when it has the financial resources to do so. \u25cf Torrey notified the Company by a letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its demand for the payment of $56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement dated October 18, 2013. Torrey and the Company entered into a consulting agreement, pursuant to which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000 per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of Common Stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic renewals unless terminated upon 30 days' written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000 and issued 15,000 shares of Common Stock during 2013. The Company contended that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contended that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of Common Stock in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company's contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The Company has accrued this amount in accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute. \u25cf On March 20, 2020, Ryan filed an action in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services Ryan alleged he performed for Social, Environmental and Economic Impact Assessments during July 2012 through September 2015 on the Concessions. Ryan alleged that such services were provided pursuant to oral agreements with the Company. Ryan claims breach of contract for failure to pay $12,000 amounts invoiced and due. On December 23, 2020, Ryan filed a motion for default judgment for $12,000 in unpaid invoices, plus legal, fees, statutory interest and any expert testimony fees. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit because the claims are barred by the statute of limitations and defective service. The Company has included the expected impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. \nContractual Obligations\nUSNG Letter Agreement - The Company is required to pay USNG a $8,000 monthly cash fee beginning at the onset of commercial helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that AMGAS receives cash receipts in excess of $25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet achieved the $25,000 cash receipts threshold, therefore there has been no payment or accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision as of December 31, 2021. [The USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of 5 years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew.]\n 37 \nFarmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% interest in the AMGAS JV that holds the Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout's existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the AMGAS JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. The first exploratory well is scheduled to commence in April 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with a goal to evaluate the first of two separate silty shale members of the Chase group of formations - the Gage Shale and the Holmesville Shale. These two shale members have not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the field.\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year; however, we do believe that inflation may significantly impact our business in 2022. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and fairly present our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following section identifies and summarizes those accounting policies considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 1 - Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for all relevant accounting policies.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we reduced our valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets by $736,000 while the valuation allowance remained at 100% of all net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We have incurred net taxable losses for 11 of the last 14 years and continue to be in a cumulative loss position at December 31, 2021. In addition, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financials are issued due to operational and financing uncertainties. Accordingly, we have determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in ASC 740. Therefore, we have determined to continue to provide a 100% valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed.\nFor income tax purposes, hawse have net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $62,990,000 as of December 31, 2021, which expire beginning in 2025 through 2041.\nWe have recently completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2020. Therefore, all such tax returns are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company's ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards in the event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Management has completed its review of whether such ownership changes have occurred, and based upon such review, management believes that the Company is not currently subject to an annual limitation or the possibility of the complete elimination of the net operating loss carry- forwards. In addition, the Company may be limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future\n 38 \nDetermination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives.\nThe estimated fair value of our derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the detachable warrants issued in connection with various notes payable, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of our Common Stock and interest rates. The detachable warrants issued in connection with the two short-term notes payable (See Note 3) contained full-ratchet, anti-dilution provisions that remain in effect during the term of the warrants while the ratchet and anti-dilution provisions of the other notes payable cease when the related note payable is extinguished. When the related notes payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions is extinguished, the derivative liability will be adjusted to fair value and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.\nOn April 1, 2021, the outstanding warrants treated as derivatives and the related notes payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions were extinguished through an exchange transaction as described in Note 3. Therefore, the derivative liability was adjusted to fair value and extinguished and included in the gain on extinguishment of notes payable as of the termination date (See Note 10).\nA comparison of the assumptions used in calculating estimated fair value of such derivative liabilities as of the April 1, 2021 termination date and December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nApril 1, 2021 (termination date)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Volatility - range </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>373.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual term </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 - 0.8 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exercise price </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Number of warrants in aggregate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of the derivative financial instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs for both open and closed derivatives:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized derivative gains included in other income/expense for the period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Extinguishment of derivative liability as part of the exchange of debt for common stock (See Notes 3 and 6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 39 \nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.

The Company has applied ASU-2020-06 to all outstanding financial instruments as of January 1, 2021, (the date of adoption of ASU 2020-06) and those entered into after January 1, 2021 including the 8% Notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, such convertible notes were required to be separated into their debt and equity components because of the issuance of detachable warrants together with the convertible notes. Accordingly, the Company allocated the proceeds of the 8% Notes as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds allocated to 8% Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds allocated to detachable warrants to purchase Common Stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total proceeds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>650,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 8% Notes issued in August 2021 (the August 8% Notes\u201d) and the 8% Notes issued in October 2021 (the October 8% Notes\u201d; collectively with the August 8% Notes, the 8% Notes\u201d)) were recorded at their par value less the discount established at their respective origination date. The note discount is amortized over the term of the convertible note utilizing the level-interest method.

When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern it should consider whether its plans to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of management's plans, the entity should disclose information that enables user of financial statements to understand the principal events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events, and management's plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe performed the analysis and our overall assessment was there were conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year, but such doubt was not adequately mitigated by our plans to address the substantial doubt as disclosed in Note 1: Going Concern.\nStock-based compensation\nWe grant share-based compensation awards in exchange for employee, director and consultant services, including a stock option plan, grants of restricted stock and common stock purchase warrants issued for services that vest over future periods considering the grantee remains as an employee or service provider to the Company. The fair value of awards granted under the plans are recognized in the Statements of Income (Loss) over the related service period. The fair values of stock options are estimated at the time of each grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair values of restricted stock grants are measured at each grant date using the closing market price on the day of grant. The fair value estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the Company's performance, and the Company's performance in relation to its peers.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOverview\nThe Company is an oil and gas exploration, development and production company, which is primarily in the business of drilling and operating oil and gas wells. From 2009 to 2020, the Company had pursued the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the Concession - Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea, containing a total of approximately 1.4 million acres. However, in January 2020, the Company abandoned the Concessions.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which provided a purchase price of $900,000. The Company raised approximately $2.05 million on March 26, 2021 through the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants.\nThe purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nWe have commenced rework of the existing production wells immediately after the acquisition of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals and gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not yet conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties, while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\n 23 \nWe may find it necessary to obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the exploration and development of the Properties enumerated above, as well as to satisfy our existing debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to fund our planned development of the Properties.\nName Change and Reincorporation Matters\nAt the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 13, 2021, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, changing the Company's name to American Noble Gas, Inc. The stockholders also approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, removing the provision providing that any action taken by the stockholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting requires that all of the Company's stockholders entitled to vote on such action consent in writing thereto. Finally, the stockholders approved the 2021 Plan and we reserved 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nReincorporation in Nevada\nOn December 7, 2021, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Predecessor merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, AMGAS-Nevada with AMGAS-Nevada continuing as the surviving corporation. In conjunction with the merger, AMGAS-Nevada succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor existing immediately prior to the merger. The merger was consummated by the filing of a Certificate of Merger on December 7, 2021 with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The Agreement and Plan of Merger and transactions contemplated thereby were adopted by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Predecessor's Common Stock and/or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted common stock basis, by written consent in lieu of a special meeting of stockholders, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, (i) each outstanding share of the Predecessor's common stock automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMGAS-Nevada, (ii) each outstanding share of the Predecessor's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMGAS-Nevada, and (iii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of the Predecessor common stock converted into an option, right or warrant to acquire an equal number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock under the same terms and conditions as the original options, rights or warrants.\nSimilar to the shares of common stock of the Predecessor prior to the merger, the shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock are quoted on the OTCQB tier operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol IFNY\u201d. In accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each outstanding certificate previously representing shares of the Predecessor's common stock or Series A Preferred Stock automatically represents, without any action of the Predecessor's stockholders, the same number of shares of AMGAS-Nevada common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the directors and officers of the Predecessor immediately prior to the merger became the directors and officers of AMGAS-Nevada and continued their respective directorship or services with the Company on the same terms as their respective directorship or services with the Predecessor immediately prior to the merger.\nAs a result of the merger, the internal affairs of the Company ceased to be subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law or governed by the Predecessor's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws. As of the December 7, 2021, effective date of the merger, the Company is now subject to the Nevada Revised Statutes and is governed by the Company's Articles of Incorporation.\nAll references to the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to the Predecessor prior to the merger, and AMGAS-Nevada subsequent to the merger.\n 24 \nOperational and Financial Objectives\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2021. Economies throughout the world have been and continue to be disrupted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent rise of the new Omicron variant. In particular, the oil and gas market has been severely adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic because of the substantial and abrupt decrease in the demand for oil and gas globally followed by the recent resurgence in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, the capital markets have experienced periods of disruption and our efforts to raise necessary capital in the future may be adversely impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and investor sentiment and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the lingering uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our discussion of our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCorporate Activities\nThe Company's 2021 operating objectives have focused on: 1) raising the necessary funds to complete the acquisition of the Properties, 2) completing the acquisition of the Properties, 3) commencing rework on the Properties, including testing and evaluation of noble gas reserves in additional to the oil and gas producing zones and 4) resolving obligations in default and/or past due.\nRecent financings -\nIssuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock - On March 26, 2021, the Company issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with an aggregate principal face amount of up to approximately $2,500,000 subject to a 10% original issue discount.

Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.\n 27 \nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, which provided a purchase price of $900,000.\nThe acquisition included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFollowing the acquisition, we have commenced rework of the existing production wells and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt, nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial conditions, changes in our financial conditions, or our results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Revenues totaled $79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had no revenues in 2020 as it focused on identification of acquisition targets of domestic oil and gas producing properties.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which provided a purchase price of $900,000. The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFollowing the acquisition, we have commenced rework of the existing production wells and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nOil and Gas Lease Operating Expenses\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Total oil and gas lease operating expenses totaled $530,118 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n 28 \nWe commenced rework of the existing production wells on the Properties in order to restore the three producing wells to full operational condition. All such rework costs were expensed as routine maintenance instead of capitalized to oil and gas properties and equipment under the full-cost method. In addition, we have performed certain exploration, including testing and evaluation for the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the existing oil and gas reserves on the Properties while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.\nThe Company had no oil and gas lease operating expenses in 2020 as it held no oil and gas producing properties.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil resulting since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021, which was acquired for $900,000 cash plus the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $13,425. The Company allocated the purchase price of $913,425 to oil and gas properties and equipment, which is subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization as the acquisition qualified as an asset acquisition. Total depreciation, depletion and amortization was $92,502 for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no depreciation, depletion and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company held no properties for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCapitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. Under this method, the sum of the full cost pool, excluding the book value of unproved properties, and all estimated future development costs are divided by the total estimated quantities of proved reserves. This rate is applied to our total production for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the appropriate expense is recorded. Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas producing activities, as well as property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities, are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nAccretion of Asset Retirement Obligation\nTotal expense for the accretion of asset retirement obligations was $836 and $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company determined the amount of the asset retirement obligation assumed to be $13,425 as of April 1, 2021, the date of the acquisition of the Properties. The obligation relates to legal requirements associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisitions, construction, development, or normal use of the asset. The obligation relates primarily to the requirement to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and support wells at the conclusion of their useful lives.\nOil and Gas Production Related Taxes\nThe Company began generating revenues from the production and sale of crude oil since the acquisition of the Properties on April 1, 2021. Oil and gas production related taxes totaled $1,060 and $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such taxes are deducted from gross oil and gas revenue by the crude oil purchaser upon payment to the Company and include primarily severance taxes imposed by the State of Kansas and Kansas conservation assessment fees. Revenues totaled $79,002 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in the deduction of $1,060 in production related taxes. The Company has received notice of an exemption from the State of Kansas, which exempted the Company form paying severance taxes due to the existing wells production levels. Therefore, production related taxes should decline as a percentage of revenue in 2022 and beyond. The Company had no revenues in 2020 and therefore there was no deduction for production related taxes in Kansas.\n 29 \nOther General and Administrative Expenses\nOther general and administrative expenses were $1,036,996 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $720,697, or 228%, from other general and administrative expenses of $316,299 for the year ended 2020. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of $314,643 in stock-based compensation due to the noncash compensation for its executives and Board members in 2021. The increase in other general and administrative expenses is also attributable to an increase $193,834 for legal fees, $37,705 for geological services and a $34,500 increase in auditor fees as the Company began operating the Properties, which required various capital raises and other filings with the SEC. In addition, the increase in other general and administrative expenses were attributable to the $75,000 charge-off of the option to acquire the Properties which expired, a $30,000 bonus paid to the Company's Chief Executive Officer attributable to his efforts in the acquisition of the Properties. The $314,643 increase in stock-based compensation was related to the amortization of the stock option grants in June 2021, the warrants issued to USNG and the Advisory Board, and the restricted stock grants in August 2020.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $108,052 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $210,931 for the in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decline of $102,879, or 49%. Interest expense declined during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the pay-off of the convertible note payable issued in August 2019, which had a stated principal balance of $365,169 and bore interest at an 8% rate until it was retired on March 26, 2021. The retirement of the two notes payable totaled $85,000 on April 1, 2021 and the August Note on March 31, 2021 resulted in less interest expense being reported during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company issued $28,665 principal balance of 3% Notes in connection with the Debt Settlement Agreements, which bear interest at 3%. Interest expense totaled $643 related to these 3% Notes during the year ended December 31, 2021 and will continue to affect interest expense in future quarters.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $50,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 145,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants, which totaled $72,874 as of April 1, 2021. In addition, on April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $35,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 100,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants, which totaled $50,956 as of April 1, 2021. The 100,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $28,000 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. Accordingly, there was less interest related to these notes in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 30, 2021 and October 29, 2021, the Company entered into two Securities Purchase Agreements with one and three, respectively, accredited investors agreed for the 8% Notes, with an aggregate principal face amount of approximately $650,000. The 8% Notes are, subject to certain conditions, convertible into an aggregate of 1,300,000 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $0.50 per share. The Company also issued five and one half-year common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 1,850,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments which are immediately exercisable. The investors purchased the 8% Notes and the warrants from the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $650,000 and the proceeds were used for general working capital purposes. The 8% Notes bear interest at 8%, however a discount was recorded for the on the relative estimated fair value of the detachable warrants issued, which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 8% Notes using the interest method. Total interest expense was $62,170 during the year ended December 31, 2021 and will continue to affect interest expense in future quarters.\nGain on Extinguishment of Liabilities\nThe Company reported a gain on exchange and extinguishment of liabilities of $86,602 and $6,150,142 in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n 30 \nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $50,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 145,000 shares of Common stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants, which totaled $72,874 as of April 1, 2021. The 145,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $40,600 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $32,274, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company and the holder of the $35,000 outstanding convertible note reached a settlement, pursuant to which the Company issued a total of 100,000 shares of Common stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants which totaled $50,956 as of April 1, 2021. The 100,000 shares issued to extinguish the debt obligations were valued at $28,000 based on the closing market price on the date of the extinguishment. The extinguishment of the debt obligations resulted in a gain of $22,956, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of liabilities totaling $31,372, which was attributable to six transactions that extinguished outstanding liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Debt Settlement Agreements extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities with a total outstanding balance of $2,866,497, for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of the 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share, which was valued at $1,605,178, which resulted in a total gain of $1,232,654 of which $124,177 was reported as a gain on extinguishment of liabilities and $1,108,477 was reported as a capital contribution. The $23,000 gain from settlement of litigation extinguished $33,000 of trade payables for a cash payment of $10,000. The loss of $115,805 is related to the early retirement of $365,169 principal balance of August 2020 Note.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the gain on extinguishment of liabilities was attributable to two transactions that extinguished outstanding liabilities; (i) the SKM Exchange Agreement, which extinguished a promissory note with an outstanding principal balance of $1,000,000, $542,762 in accrued interest and other obligations previously outstanding and resulting in a total gain of $1,310,006, and (ii) the extinguishment of trade payable obligations totaling $4,840,136 that arose during 2013, which were extinguished in 2020 pursuant to the relevant statute of limitations.\nChange in Derivative Fair Value\nThe conversion feature in certain outstanding promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were treated as derivative instruments because such notes and warrants contained ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $199 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $795 during the year ended December 31, 2020. All short-term notes and their related derivative warrants have been terminated as of December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax\nThe Company recorded no income tax benefit (expense) in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company has been in a cumulative tax loss position and has substantial net operating loss carryforwards available for its utilization at December 31, 2021. The Company has continued to carry a 100% reserve on its net deferred tax assets and therefore recorded no income tax expense or benefit on its income (loss) before income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNet Income (Loss)\nThe Company reported a net loss of $1,603,761 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $5,623,707 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents a decrease of $7,227,468 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n 31 \nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends\nThe Company recorded $174,449 and $-0- in convertible preferred stock dividends in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On March 26, 2021, the Company issued and classified its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as equity securities in the balance sheet. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock bears a cumulative dividend at a 10% rate based on its stated/liquidation value. There were no outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income (Loss) Applicable to Common Stockholders\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued on March 26, 2021 has a preference over Common Stock and therefore such accrued dividend amounts have been deducted from net income (loss) to report net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders of $(1,778,210) and $5,623,707 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders per Share\nBasic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and dilutive Common Stock Equivalents outstanding during the period. Common Stock Equivalents included in the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share computation represent shares of Common Stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of Convertible Promissory Notes, Convertible Preferred Stock and the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and if converted\u201d method. For periods in which net losses attributable to common stockholders are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of Common Stock Equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect. In addition, in periods in which there is net income attributable to common stockholders and the effect of including Common Stock Equivalents in the diluted per share calculations would be anti-dilutive (such as when the conversion or exercise price of the common stock equivalents are higher than the average closing market price per share) such anti-dilutive Common Stock Equivalents would also be excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nThe Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021, therefore all Common Stock Equivalents were considered anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share computations. The basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share were $(0.09) for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the August Note were considered Common Stock equivalents and therefore the dilutive effect of such issuance was included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share. All shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible debt (other than the August Note) and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants were antidilutive, and, therefore, not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The basic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.39 and the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.36 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPotential Common Stock Equivalents as of December 31, 2021 totaled 27,728,864 shares of Common Stock, which included 1,357,330 shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Promissory Notes, 6,898,750 shares of Common Stock underlying the conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 17,580,784 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding warrants and 1,892,000 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding stock options.\n 32 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern-\nWe have had a history of losses and have generated little or no operating revenues for a number of years, as we concentrated on the development of our Concessions, which was a long-term, high-risk/reward exploration project in an otherwise unproven part of the world. We abandoned the Concessions in early 2020 due to the challenging economic and political issues in Nicaragua and the oil and gas industry in general. We have been assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving the acquisition, exploration and development of gas and oil properties in the United States, including the possibility of acquiring businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil and gas in the United States. As a result, we completed the purchase of the Properties on April 1, 2021 and have commenced certain rework to the existing producing wells and intend to perform workovers and other develop activities on the Properties during 2022. We plan to evaluate the Properties for additional reserves of noble gases, which may change our development plans should we determine that reserves of noble gases exist on the Properties at commercial quantities. The planned development of the Properties will require us to raise additional capital to accomplish our operating plan, which cannot be assured. Historically, we financed our operations through the issuance of equity and various short and long-term debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide the holders with a level of equity participation.\nCapital Raised\nHistorically, we have raised funds through various equity and debt instruments through private transactions. The following summarizes the sources of significant liquidity raised during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nThe Company has been able to raise the liquidity during 2021 and 2020 through the issuance of debt and equity in private transactions with accredited investors. These financial instruments generally require the Company to register the Common Stock underlying the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the convertible notes, provide the holders with a right to participate in future capital raises and require their approval for the future issuance of securities at rates less than $0.50 per share. The holders have also agreed that the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the convertible promissory notes and the exercise of the underlying warrants are generally subject to beneficial ownership limitations such that each holder of the financial instruments individually may not convert the underlying Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible notes or exercise the underlying warrants to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in any of the holders individually being the beneficial owner in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election of the holders, 9.99%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise, which beneficial ownership limitation may be increased or decreased up to 9.99% upon notice to the Company, provided that any increase in such limitation will not be effective until 61 days following notice to the Company.\nWe will likely continue to issue such convertible instruments with detachable warrants to acquire Common Stock to fund our operational and capital expenditure plans for 2022.\nLetter of Engagement\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company engaged Univest to act as the exclusive financial advisor, and the lead underwriter in the Offering. The size of the Offering is expected to be between $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 upon closing of the Offering. The Public Offering Price will be determined by mutual agreement of the Company and Univest and will be determined at the signing of the final Underwriting Agreement, which will based on, among other things, market conditions at the time of the Offering.\nPursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, Univest will act as principal, or the representative of a number of broker-dealers that will offer the securities in a public offering. The Letter Of Engagement anticipates that Univest will receive a gross discount equal to eight percent (8%) of the Public Offering Price on each share of the securities being offered. Univest has agreed to negotiate in good faith with other underwriters who, acting severally, could contract to act as an underwriter in connection with the sale of the securities being offered. Univest will also have the right to re-offer all or any part of the securities being offered to other broker-dealers. Univest will be entitled to warrants to purchase common stock representing five percent (5%) of the amount of securities sold in the Offering with an exercise price determined to be 110% of the Public Offering Price.\nThe Company also agreed to reimburse Univest, at and out of the proceeds of the Offering closings, for all of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (including, but not limited to, travel, due diligence expenses, reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, roadshow and background check on the Company's principals) in connection with the performance of its services hereunder not to exceed an aggregate of $150,000. In addition, at the closing of the Offering, the Company agreed to reimburse Univest one percent (1%) of the actual amount of the Offering as nonaccountable expense of the offering.\nThe term of the Letter of Engagement expires upon the earlier to occur of (i) six (6) months from the date of execution or (ii) the mutual written agreement of the Company and Univest.\nCapital Expenditures\nAcquisition of the Oil and Gas Properties in Central Kansas Uplift - On July 31, 2019, we acquired the option from Core to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for the Properties. We paid a non-refundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the previous option. the newly acquired option, however, permits the Company to purchase the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2-10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020 the parties executed the Asset Purchase Agreement which extended the new option to January 11, 2021, which has expired.\n 33 \nWe, Core, and Seller entered into the Side Letters on September 2, 2020 and March 31, 2021, pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date of the acquisition of the Properties under the Asset Purchase Agreement to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement for $900,000.\nThe purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.\nFarmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field- On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% joint venture interest in the AMGAS JV that holds a Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney counties, Kansas.\nThe Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to begin in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout's existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout Agreement provides the JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices.\nThe AMGAS JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV plans to target brine with commercial quantities of bromine and iodine. AMGAS is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells.\nWe will likely find it necessary to obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field, as well as to satisfy our existing debt obligations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to fund our planned development of the Properties or the Hugoton Gas Field.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the future in order to fund the (i) development of the Properties acquired on April 1, 2021; (ii) to fund our exploration and development obligations under the Farmout Agreement in the Hugoton Gas Field; (iii) normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (iv) outstanding debt and other financial obligations including the payment of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock dividends and the repayment of the convertible notes payable as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial concerns that must be successfully addressed during 2022.\nThe Company has made substantial progress in resolving many of its existing financial obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In that regard, on March 31, 2021, the Company and six creditors entered into Debt Settlement Agreements, which extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling $2,866,497 in exchange for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share. On April 1, 2021, the Company and the holders of two notes payable that were in default reached a settlement whereby the Company issued a total of 245,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding principal, accrued interest and associated common stock purchase warrants which totaled $123,830 as of April 1, 2021. The Company has made substantial progress in resolving its financial obligations; however, there is in excess of $1.9 million of old unpaid accounts payable and accrued liabilities that the Company believes that it may not have to pay based on the relevant Statute of Limitations on repayment.\n 34 \nThe Company will have significant financial commitments to execute its planned exploration and development of the Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field. The Company may find it necessary to raise substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to fund such exploration and development activities and may seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the Properties in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such new funding or be able to reach agreements with industry operators and other third parties or on what terms.\nDue to the uncertainties related to the foregoing matters, our independent registered accounting firm has expressed the option that there exists substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financials are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nCash and cash equivalents balances-\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $260,590, an increase from a balance of $11,042 as of December 31, 2020. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the $249,548 net increase in cash during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n \u25cf Operating activities: $801,553 of net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $801,553 and $196,618 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a deterioration of $604,935. The [deterioration] was primarily the result of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The Company reported net income (loss) of $(1,603,761) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5,623,707 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We acquired the Properties in 2021 and have expended substantial amounts during 2021 on well workovers and exploration/evaluation of potential noble gas reserves on the Properties, which has contributed to the increased usage of cash flow in operating activities. \u25cf Investing activities: $900,000 of net cash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2020. We completed the acquisition of the Properties during 2021. \u25cf Financing activities: $1,951,101 of net cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,951,101 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $205,875 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company raised $1,929,089 through the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, raised $650,000 through the issuance of convertible promissory notes, repaid $453,539 of convertible notes payable and paid dividends of $174,449 during 2021. \nThe net result of these activities was a $249,548 increase in cash and cash equivalents from $11,042 as of December 31, 2020 to $260,590 as of December 31, 2021.\nCommitments:\nCapital Expenditures. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2021. The Farmout Agreement that we entered into in April 2022 required us to drill at least one production well in 2022. We expect to begin in April 2022 and estimate that the expenses related to the drilling program to be approximately $350,000 for drilling of the initial well.\n 35 \nRepayment of Debt. Debt obligations is comprised of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nDebt obligations become due and payable as follows:\n\nOpen Litigation.\nThe Company is subject to various claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming breach of contract due to the Company's failure to pay amounts due. The Company believes that it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial statements.\nThe Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:\n \u25cf In October 2012, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas, seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to other wells in Texas, to $45,103, which amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter. \n 36 \n Pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the State of Texas, the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter, who may be held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company. Therefore, to the extent liabilities might actually occur, these are the obligations of the Company. Management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000, calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 wells operated by Infinity Texas. Theses related liabilities, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, are included in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets. \u25cf On September 26, 2014, Cambrian filed an action in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality control and management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the Concessions. Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a master consulting agreement with the Company, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle the default judgment when it has the financial resources to do so. \u25cf Torrey notified the Company by a letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its demand for the payment of $56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement dated October 18, 2013. Torrey and the Company entered into a consulting agreement, pursuant to which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000 per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of Common Stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic renewals unless terminated upon 30 days' written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000 and issued 15,000 shares of Common Stock during 2013. The Company contended that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contended that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of Common Stock in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company's contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The Company has accrued this amount in accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute. \u25cf On March 20, 2020, Ryan filed an action in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, against the Company resulting from certain professional consulting services Ryan alleged he performed for Social, Environmental and Economic Impact Assessments during July 2012 through September 2015 on the Concessions. Ryan alleged that such services were provided pursuant to oral agreements with the Company. Ryan claims breach of contract for failure to pay $12,000 amounts invoiced and due. On December 23, 2020, Ryan filed a motion for default judgment for $12,000 in unpaid invoices, plus legal, fees, statutory interest and any expert testimony fees. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit because the claims are barred by the statute of limitations and defective service. The Company has included the expected impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. \nContractual Obligations\nUSNG Letter Agreement - The Company is required to pay USNG a $8,000 monthly cash fee beginning at the onset of commercial helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that AMGAS receives cash receipts in excess of $25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet achieved the $25,000 cash receipts threshold, therefore there has been no payment or accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision as of December 31, 2021. [The USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of 5 years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew.]\n 37 \nFarmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% interest in the AMGAS JV that holds the Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout's existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the AMGAS JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. The first exploratory well is scheduled to commence in April 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with a goal to evaluate the first of two separate silty shale members of the Chase group of formations - the Gage Shale and the Holmesville Shale. These two shale members have not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the field.\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year; however, we do believe that inflation may significantly impact our business in 2022. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and fairly present our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following section identifies and summarizes those accounting policies considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 1 - Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for all relevant accounting policies.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we reduced our valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets by $736,000 while the valuation allowance remained at 100% of all net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We have incurred net taxable losses for 11 of the last 14 years and continue to be in a cumulative loss position at December 31, 2021. In addition, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financials are issued due to operational and financing uncertainties. Accordingly, we have determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in ASC 740. Therefore, we have determined to continue to provide a 100% valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed.\nFor income tax purposes, hawse have net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $62,990,000 as of December 31, 2021, which expire beginning in 2025 through 2041.\nWe have recently completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2020. Therefore, all such tax returns are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company's ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards in the event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Management has completed its review of whether such ownership changes have occurred, and based upon such review, management believes that the Company is not currently subject to an annual limitation or the possibility of the complete elimination of the net operating loss carry- forwards. In addition, the Company may be limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future\n 38 \nDetermination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives.\nThe estimated fair value of our derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the detachable warrants issued in connection with various notes payable, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of our Common Stock and interest rates. The detachable warrants issued in connection with the two short-term notes payable (See Note 3) contained full-ratchet, anti-dilution provisions that remain in effect during the term of the warrants while the ratchet and anti-dilution provisions of the other notes payable cease when the related note payable is extinguished. When the related notes payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions is extinguished, the derivative liability will be adjusted to fair value and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.\nOn April 1, 2021, the outstanding warrants treated as derivatives and the related notes payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions were extinguished through an exchange transaction as described in Note 3. Therefore, the derivative liability was adjusted to fair value and extinguished and included in the gain on extinguishment of notes payable as of the termination date (See Note 10).\nA comparison of the assumptions used in calculating estimated fair value of such derivative liabilities as of the April 1, 2021 termination date and December 31, 2020 is as follows:\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of the derivative financial instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs for both open and closed derivatives:\n\n 39 \nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\n \u25cf Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \u25cf Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities) \u25cf Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions in determining the fair value) \nThe following table represents the Company's hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n\nDetermination of Fair Value for Detachable Common Stock Purchase warrants issued in connection with Convertible Notes Payable.\nThe Company has raised capital through the issuance of convertible debt instruments with detachable warrants to acquire common stock which require an allocation of the proceeds between the debt and equity components of such instruments. The Company has applied ASU-2020-06 to all outstanding financial instruments as of January 1, 2021, (the date of adoption of ASU 2020-06) and those entered into after January 1, 2021 including the 8% Notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, such convertible notes were required to be separated into their debt and equity components because of the issuance of detachable warrants together with the convertible notes. Accordingly, the Company allocated the proceeds of the 8% Notes as follows:\n\nThe 8% Notes issued in August 2021 (the August 8% Notes\u201d) and the 8% Notes issued in October 2021 (the October 8% Notes\u201d; collectively with the August 8% Notes, the 8% Notes\u201d)) were recorded at their par value less the discount established at their respective origination date. The note discount is amortized over the term of the convertible note utilizing the level-interest method. The following is the assumptions used in calculating the estimated grant-date fair value of the detachable warrants to purchase Common Stock granted in connection with the 8% Notes during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n 40 \nFollowing is a summary of activity relative to the 8% Notes as for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\nGoing Concern Analysis.\nIn accordance with ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we are required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that our financials are issued. When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern it should consider whether its plans to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of management's plans, the entity should disclose information that enables user of financial statements to understand the principal events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events, and management's plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe performed the analysis and our overall assessment was there were conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year, but such doubt was not adequately mitigated by our plans to address the substantial doubt as disclosed in Note 1: Going Concern.\nStock-based compensation\nWe grant share-based compensation awards in exchange for employee, director and consultant services, including a stock option plan, grants of restricted stock and common stock purchase warrants issued for services that vest over future periods considering the grantee remains as an employee or service provider to the Company. The fair value of awards granted under the plans are recognized in the Statements of Income (Loss) over the related service period. The fair values of stock options are estimated at the time of each grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair values of restricted stock grants are measured at each grant date using the closing market price on the day of grant. The fair value estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the Company's performance, and the Company's performance in relation to its peers.
