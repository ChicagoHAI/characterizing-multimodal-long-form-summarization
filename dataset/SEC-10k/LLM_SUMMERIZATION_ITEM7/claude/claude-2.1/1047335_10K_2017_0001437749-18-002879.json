At December 31, 2017 we operate or manage 76 skilled nursing facilities with 9,597 licensed beds, 24 assisted living facilities, five independent living facilities, and 36 homecare programs located in 10 states. These operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries. We have a non-controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services NHC owned health care centers and others. In addition, we provide management services, accounting and financial services, and insurance services to third party operators of healthcare properties. We also own the real estate of 13 healthcare properties and lease these properties to third party operators.\nExecutive Summary\nEarnings\nTo monitor our earnings, we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor, census, and the composition of revenues. Inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline.\nOccupancy\nA primary area of management focus continues to be the rates of occupancy within our skilled nursing facilities. The overall census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2017 was 90.2% compared to 89.5% and 90.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the average length of stay decreasing for a skilled nursing patient, as well as the increased availability of assisted living facilities and home and community-based services, the challenge of maintaining desirable patient census levels has been amplified. Management has undertaken a number of steps in order to best position our current and future health care facilities. This includes working internally to examine and improve systems to be most responsive to referral sources and payors. Additionally, NHC is in various stages of partnerships with hospital systems, payors, and other post-acute alliances in positioning ourselves to be an active participant in the health delivery systems as they develop.\nQuality of Patient Care\nCMS introduced the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities more easily. The Five-Star Quality Rating System gives each skilled nursing operation a rating of between one and five stars in various categories (five stars being the best). The Company has always strived for patient-centered care and quality outcomes as precursors to outstanding financial performance. The average Five-Star rating for all of our skilled nursing facilities was 4.25 for 2017. The table below summarizes our performance in these quality ratings for the most recent three years:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December, 31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total number of skilled nursing facilities, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of 4 and 5-star rated skilled nursing facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of 4 and 5-star rated skilled nursing facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>82% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelopment and Growth\nWe are undertaking to expand our post-acute and senior health care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets. The following table lists our recent construction and purchase activities.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> Type of Operation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Description\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Size\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Location\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Placed in Service\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF/ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 92 beds/60 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gallatin, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> April, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Partnership\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 60 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> St. Peters, MO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> November, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 44 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Charleston, SC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> May, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF/ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 90 beds / 80 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Nashville, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Kingsport, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> September, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 112 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Columbia, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> January, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 78 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bluffton, SC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> March, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 80 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Garden City, SC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 23 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Murfreesboro, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> July, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 30 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Springfield, MO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Under construction\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 60 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Farragut, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Under construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the projects under construction at December 31, 2017, the 30-bed skilled nursing addition in Springfield, Missouri is expected to open during the first quarter of 2018. The 60-bed memory care addition in Farragut, Tennessee is expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDuring 2017, we plan to apply for Certificates of Need for additional beds in certain of our markets. We also will evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building Medicare and private pay health care facilities or private pay assisted living communities.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nIn connection with the enactment of The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $8,488,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017. This estimated benefit was due from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on the new lower corporate income tax rate.\nThis recently passed Tax Act will have a favorable impact on our net income, earnings per share, and operating cash flow in 2018. Like most companies, we continue to evaluate the details within this legislation, but our preliminary estimate indicates our effective tax rate in 2018 should be between 22% to 26% (down from 36% to 39% in prior periods). The Company is evaluating the cash benefit of the Tax Act and believes that it will complement our existing cash usage priorities such as business and capital expenditures that result in growth, dividends to our shareholders, share buybacks, and debt reduction.\nAccrued Risk Reserves\nOur accrued professional liability reserves, workers' compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled $93,275,000 and $91,162,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are a primary area of management focus. We have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities to fund our professional liability and workers' compensation reserves.\nAs to exposure for professional liability claims, we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure, including in-house acquired pressure ulcers, significant weight loss and numbers of falls. These programs for certification, which we regularly modify and improve, have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents. Our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction.\nGovernment Program Financial Changes\nMedicare - Skilled Nursing Facilities\nIn July 2017, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2018 Medicare payments and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2018 final rule provided for an approximate 1.0% rate update, which began October 1, 2017. CMS estimated a 2.7% market basket increase reduced by 0.4% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA; however, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) mandated that all post-acute care providers receive a maximum market basket update of 1% in fiscal year 2018 to offset part of the cost of the legislation. CMS estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2018 by $370 million compared to fiscal year 2017 levels. CMS also revised and rebased the market basket index by updating the base year from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014.\nIn July 2016, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2017 Medicare payments and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2017 final rule provided for an approximate 2.4% rate update, which began October 1, 2016. This increase consisted of a 2.7% market basket increase reduced by 0.3% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA. The policy changes in the 2017 final rule continue to shift skilled nursing facility Medicare payments from volume to value. The final rule makes changes to the SNF Quality Reporting Program and Value-Based Purchasing Program with some of these changes effective for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017.\nFor 2017, our average Medicare per diem rate for skilled nursing facilities increased 1.8% compared to the same period in 2016. No assurances can be given as to whether Congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future, the timing of any action or the form of relief, if any, that may be enacted.\nMedicaid - Skilled Nursing Facilities\nEffective July 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, the state of Tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2018 fiscal year will be approximately $3,600,000 annually, or $900,000 per quarter.\nEffective October 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate changes. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2018 fiscal year will be approximately $1,100,000 annually, or $275,000 per quarter.\nEffective August 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, the state of Missouri approved a Medicaid rate decrease of $5.37 per patient day, or an approximate 3.5% decrease, to Missouri skilled nursing providers. We estimate the resulting decrease in revenue will be approximately $1,400,000 annually, or $350,000 per quarter.\nOverall our average Medicaid per diem increased 2.0 % in 2017 compared to 2016. We face challenges with respect to states' Medicaid payments, because many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients. States will continue to control Medicaid expenditures and also look for adequate funding sources, including provider assessments or increasing state funding for home and community-based services, potentially having an impact on funding for skilled nursing facilities.\nMedicare - Homecare Programs\nIn November 2017 and effective January 1, 2018, CMS released its final rule for 2018 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimated the net impact of the PPS rule resulted in a 0.4% decrease ($80 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2018. This decrease reflects the effects of a 1.0% home health payment update percentage; a -0.97% percent adjustment to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rate to account for nominal case-mix growth; and the sunset of the rural add-on provision for an impact of -0.5%. The rule also finalizes proposals for the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model and the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP). CMS is not finalizing the implementation of the Home Health Groupings Model (HHGM) in this final rule.\nIn October 2016 and effective January 1, 2017, CMS released its final rule for 2017 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimated the net impact of the PPS rule resulted in a 0.7% decrease ($130 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2017. The estimated decrease reflects the effects of a 2.5% home health payment update; rebasing adjustments to the national standardized 60-day episode payment rate, the national per-visit payment rate, and the non-routine medical supplies conversion factor (expected impact of -2.3%), and the effects of an adjustment to the national standardized 60-day episode payment rate to account for nominal case-mix growth (expected impact of -0.9%). However, the freestanding home health agencies were expected to have an overall reduction of 0.8%, and agencies in eight states including the states of South Carolina and Florida were expected to average a reimbursement decrease of 1.9%.\nSegment Reporting\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2017 with the leadership change of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, we reassessed and realigned our reportable operating segments to coincide with the way our new leadership and CODM measures Company performance and allocates resources. The Company has two reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted and independent living facilities, and (2) homecare services. These reportable operating segments are consistent with information used by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as CODM, to assess performance and allocate resources.\nThe Company also reports an all other\u201d category that includes revenues from rental income, management and accounting services fees, insurance services, and costs of the corporate office. The Company has presented the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 on a comparative basis to conform with the current year segment presentation. For additional information on these reportable segments see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nThe Company's CODM evaluates performance and allocates capital resources to each segment based on an operating model that is designed to improve the quality of patient care and profitability of the Company while enhancing long-term shareholder value. The CODM does not review assets by segment in his resource allocation and therefore, assets by segment are not disclosed below.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income by business segment (in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

order to facilitate the comparison of the current year financial performance to the prior year, this summary table highlights the impact of the Tax Act on the Company's 2017 financial performance. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a tax benefit in the amount of $8,488,000 from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on the new lower corporate income tax rate. The two columns in 2017 below outline the financial performance including and excluding the tax reform adjustment, which is in comparison to the 2016 financial performance.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Including tax\nreform\nadjustment\n(GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Excluding\ntax reform\nadjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net operating revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>966,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>966,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>926,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,867 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,669 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to NHC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 include a 4.4% increase in net operating revenues and an 11.2% increase in net income attributable to NHC, which includes the 2017 fourth quarter tax reform adjustment. There have been five newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 (two skilled nursing facilities and three assisted living facilities). The operating losses before income taxes for these entities were approximately $7,003,000 and $3,882,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Therefore, excluding the operating losses from these five newly constructed facilities and the 2017 fourth quarter tax reform benefit, net income attributable to NHC would have been $51,526,000 and $52,906,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe overall average census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2017 was 90.2% compared to 89.5% in 2016. The composite skilled nursing facility per diem increased 2.6% in 2017 compared to 2016. Medicare and Managed Care per diem rates increased 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016. Medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased 2.0% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet patient revenues totaled $919,843,000, an increase of $39,119,000, or 4.4%, compared to the prior year. The newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 helped increase net patient revenues $17,441,000 compared to a year ago. The remaining increase in our net patient revenues is primarily due to the census increase and per diem increases in our existing skilled nursing facility operations.\nOther revenues this year were $47,153,000, an increase of $1,239,000, or 2.7%, as further detailed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Other revenues in 2017 include management and accounting service fees of $16,169,000 ($15,953,000 in 2016), insurance services revenue of $8,003,000 ($7,195,000 in 2016) and rental revenues of $21,957,000 ($21,835,000 in 2016). During the first quarter of 2017, we began management contract services for a third-party owner of two skilled nursing facilities in the middle Tennessee area. These two contracts helped increase management fee and insurance services revenues by $827,000 compared to the prior year.\nTotal costs and expenses for 2017 increased $46,790,000, or 5.4%, to $912,886,000 from $866,096,000 in 2016.\nSalaries, wages and benefits, the largest operating costs of the company, increased $24,036,000, or 4.4%, to $572,043,000 from $548,007,000. These costs were 59.2% and 59.1% of net operating revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 helped increase salaries, wages and benefits by $8,220,000 compared to a year ago. The remaining increase in salaries, wages and benefits in 2017 is due to the increase in our existing skilled nursing facilities and the continued wage pressure in certain markets in which we operate.\nOther operating expenses increased $19,101,000, or 8.2%, to $252,934,000 for 2017 compared to $233,833,000 in 2016. These costs were 26.1% and 25.2% of net operating revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses for 2017 was primarily due to the operations of the newly constructed healthcare facilities compared to a year ago ($9,098,000). We also had unfavorable results within our self-insurance accrued risk reserve programs compared to a year ago ($6,368,000) due to the increase in professional liability lawsuits during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we and/or our managed facilities are currently defendants in 60 claims. At December 31, 2016, we and/or our managed facilities were defendants in 43 claims.\nFacility rent expense decreased $925,000, or 2.2%, to $40,367,000.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 9.3% to $42,652,000. The majority of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the five newly constructed healthcare facilities.\nInterest expense increased $949,000 to $4,890,000 in 2017 from $3,941,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily from the increased interest rate on the line of credit borrowings compared to a year ago. At December 31, 2017, we had $90 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nNon-operating income in 2017 increased $774,000, or 3.9% to $20,439,000, as further detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. The increase in non-operating income is primarily from the sale of the 83-unit assisted living facility in Evans, Georgia during the third quarter of 2017 in which we had an equity method investment and 10% ownership stake. This sale transaction increased non-operating income $1,310,000 in comparison to a year ago. We also received approximately $250,000 annually in management services revenue from this entity, in which we no longer provided management services after September 30, 2017.\nThe noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is the joint venture operations of a skilled nursing facility in Columbia, Tennessee. This facility opened and began operating in January 2017 in which NHC owns 80% of the operating entity and Maury Regional Medical Center owns 20% of the entity.\nThe income tax provision for 2017 is $18,867,000 (an effective income tax rate of 25.3%). As stated above, we recorded a tax benefit of $8,488,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the U.S. tax reform legislation. This estimated benefit was due from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower federal corporate income tax rate. The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2017 were also favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,753,000 or 2.4% of income before taxes in 2017.\nThe income tax provision for 2016 is $29,669,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.0%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2016 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,368,000 or 1.7% of income before taxes in 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 include a 2.2% increase in net operating revenues and a 9.1% increase in net income available to common stockholders. There have been four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2015 and 2016 (two skilled nursing facilities and two assisted living facilities). The operating losses before income taxes for these entities were approximately $7,583,000 and $3,705,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, excluding the operating losses from these four newly constructed facilities, net income attributable to NHC would have been $55,164,000 and $48,584,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe overall average census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2016 was 89.5% compared to 90.0% in 2015. The composite skilled nursing facility per diem increased 1.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. Medicare and Managed Care per diem rates increased 2.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. Medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet patient revenues totaled $880,724,000, an increase of $15,878,000, or 1.8%, compared to the prior year. The majority of the increase in net patient revenues was derived from the four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016 ($10,491,000). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded revenue of $1,374,000 for the settlement and the withdrawal of our administrative appeals process with South Carolina Health and Human Services surrounding the audit of our 2013 and 2014 cost reports.\nOther revenues this year were $45,914,000, an increase of $4,138,000, or 9.9%, as further detailed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Other revenues in 2016 include management and accounting service fees of $15,953,000 ($14,586,000 in 2015), insurance services revenue of $7,195,000 ($7,012,000 in 2015) and rental revenues of $21,835,000 ($19,191,000 in 2015).\nAs to rental revenues, effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a new triple net lease agreement for 11 of the 13 healthcare properties that we own and lease to third party operators. The new lease agreement is for a ten-year period and increased rental income for the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $2,283,000 over 2015 and the previous lease agreement.\nTotal costs and expenses for 2016 increased $26,600,000, or 3.2%, to $866,096,000 from $839,496,000 in 2015.\nSalaries, wages and benefits, the largest operating costs of the company, increased $15,272,000, or 2.9%, to $548,007,000 from $532,735,000. These costs were 59.1% and 58.8% of net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was derived from our same-facility nursing centers ($7,353,000), which was to retain and attract quality partners. The remaining increase in salaries and wages in 2016 was from the four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016 ($6,527,000).\nOther operating expenses increased $6,761,000, or 3.0%, to $233,833,000 for 2016 compared to $227,072,000 in 2015. These costs were 25.2% and 25.0% of net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily due to the increased general and professional liability costs ($3,380,000). As of December 31, 2016, we and/or our managed facilities are currently defendants in 43 claims. At December 31, 2015, we and/or our managed facilities were defendants in 32 claims. In addition to the increased professional liability costs, the remaining other operating expense increase was derived from the new operations of the four healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016.\nFacility rent expense increased $1,325,000, or 3.3%, to $41,292,000.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 5.1% to $39,023,000. The majority of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the four newly constructed healthcare facilities.\nInterest expense increased $1,333,000 to $3,941,000 in 2016 from $2,608,000 in 2015. The increase in interest expense is due from twelve months of borrowings on the credit facility compared to just two months of borrowings during 2015. The Company's Preferred Stock was redeemed in November 2015; therefore, initiating the borrowings on the credit facility. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $110 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nNon-operating income in 2016 increased $1,517,000, or 8.4%, to $19,665,000, as further detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. The increase in non-operating income is primarily from the increased equity in earnings from our geriatric psychiatric hospital in Osage Beach, Missouri ($1,416,000).\nThe income tax provision for 2016 is $29,669,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.0%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2016 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,368,000 or 1.7% of income before taxes in 2016.\nThe income tax provision for 2015 was $32,131,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.7%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2015 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $2,141,000 or 2.5% of income before taxes in 2015.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur primary sources of cash include revenues from the healthcare and senior living facilities we operate, homecare services, insurance services, management services and accounting services. Our primary uses of cash include salaries, wages and benefits, operating costs of the healthcare facilities, the cost of additions to and acquisitions of real property, rent expenses, and dividend distributions. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/15\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,104 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,560 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,476 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,476 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72,784 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,692 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,131 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,943 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,131 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,675 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $94,466,000 as compared to $90,882,000 and $83,355,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $55,682,000, adjustments for non-cash items of $44,872,000, gains on the sale of marketable securities of $262,000, and cash distributions in excess of earnings from equity method investments of $897,000. There was cash used for working capital needs in the amount of $6,723,000 in 2017 compared to $10,553,000 and $14,913,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2017, working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accounts receivable of $9,492,000. The increase in accounts receivable is from the new operations of the five healthcare facilities that began operating during the 2016 and 2017 years.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $9,560,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $81,476,000 and $72,784,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash used for property and equipment additions was $32,347,000, $62,601,000, and $58,416,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of restricted marketable securities, net of purchases, resulted in positive cash flow in 2017 of $18,953,000. This is compared to a net use of cash from the purchasing of restricted marketable securities in the amount of $13,978,000 and $12,966,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2017, construction costs included in additions to property and equipment include $2,502,000 for the construction and completion of the 112-bed skilled nursing facility in Columbia, Tennessee that began operations in 2017, which is the partnership between NHC and Maury Regional Medical Center; $3,337,000 for the final construction and furnishings of the two assisted living facilities in South Carolina that began operations in 2017; $3,865,000 for the construction and completion of the 23 unit memory care addition located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee that opened during the third quarter of 2017; and $3,728,000 for the construction of the 30 bed addition to a skilled nursing facility in Springfield, Missouri that will begin operations in 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $49,074,000, $27,131,000 and $41,675,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, $20,000,000 was used to pay down the outstanding principal balance on our credit facility. Dividends paid to common stockholders for the 2017 and 2016 years were $28,237,000 and $25,795,000, respectively. For the 2015 year, $30,075,000 was used to pay dividends to the Company's common and preferred stockholders. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options, totaled $2,524,000 in 2017 compared to $10,772,000 and $10,634,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. On August 5, 2016, the Company repurchased 130,000 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $8,195,000.\nIn November 2015, the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of $15.75 per share. The mandatory redemption required the Company to pay stockholders approximately $130,538,000, of which $110,000,000 of the funding came from borrowings under our credit facility. Therefore, the Company used approximately $20,538,000 of cash for the redemption of the Preferred Stock.\nTable of Contractual Cash Obligations\nOur contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to December 31, 2017 are as follows (in 000's):\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt - interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,914 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>345,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term liquidity\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities. In addition to cash flows from operations, our current cash on hand of $59,118,000, marketable securities of $139,085,000 and as needed, our borrowing capacity on the credit facility, are expected to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, operating liquidity, and our growth and development plans in the next twelve months.\nLong-term liquidity\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities, our current cash on hand of $59,118,000, marketable securities of $139,085,000, and our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance on the credit facility is $90,000,000; therefore, leaving $85,000,000 available for future borrowings. The maturity date on the credit facility is October 7, 2020. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions.\nOur ability to refinance the credit agreement, to meet our long-term contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements, growth and development plans will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, financial and other factors, including potential changes in state and federal government payment rates for health care, customer demand, success of our marketing efforts, pressures from competitors, and the state of the economy, including the state of financial and credit markets.\nContingencies\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has remained relatively low during the past three years. However, rates paid under the Medicare and Medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs. Therefore, there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs.\nSee Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pending litigation and other contingencies.\nGuarantees\nAt December 31, 2017, we have no agreements to guarantee the debt obligations of other parties.\nWe have no outstanding letters of credit. We may or may not in the future elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure in the future. At December 31, 2017, we did not participate in any such financial investments.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nOur critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition - Third Party Payors\nMedicare and Medicaid program revenues, as well as certain Managed Care program revenues, are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives or their agents. In our opinion, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews. Any differences between our original estimates of reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected in operations in the period in which the revisions are made often due to final determination or the period of payment no longer being subject to audit or review. We have made provisions of approximately $17,389,000 and $17,019,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for various Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care claims reviews and current and prior year cost reports.\nRevenue Recognition - Private Pay\nFor private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities, we bill room and board charges for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed. Charges for ancillary, pharmacy, therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services; however, all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed.\nRevenue Recognition - Subordination of Fees and Uncertain Collections\nWe provide management services to healthcare operators and to others we provide accounting and financial services. We generally charge 6% of net operating revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services. Our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided. However, under the terms of our management contracts, payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long-term care center being managed. Furthermore, for certain of the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined, based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, that collection is not reasonably assured, our policy is to recognize revenues only in the period in which the amounts are realized. We may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers or proceeds from the sale of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees. There can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur. The realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a skilled nursing or assisted living facility and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful. We may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit. Also, we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center.\nAccrued Risk Reserves\nWe are self-insured for risks related to health insurance and have wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies that insure risks related to workers' compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy is to engage an external, independent actuary to assist in estimating our exposure for claims obligations (for both asserted and unasserted claims). We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis.\nProfessional liability remains an area of particular concern to us. The long-term care industry has seen an increase in personal injury/wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by skilled nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2017, we and/or our managed centers are defendants in 60 claims. It remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. It is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe are principally self-insured for incidents occurring in all centers owned or leased by us. The coverages include both primary policies and excess policies. In all years, settlements, if any, in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nNational HealthCare Corporation, which we also refer to as NHC or the Company, is a leading provider of post-acute care and senior health care services. At December 31, 2017 we operate or manage 76 skilled nursing facilities with 9,597 licensed beds, 24 assisted living facilities, five independent living facilities, and 36 homecare programs located in 10 states. These operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries. We have a non-controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services NHC owned health care centers and others. In addition, we provide management services, accounting and financial services, and insurance services to third party operators of healthcare properties. We also own the real estate of 13 healthcare properties and lease these properties to third party operators.\nExecutive Summary\nEarnings\nTo monitor our earnings, we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor, census, and the composition of revenues. Inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline.\nOccupancy\nA primary area of management focus continues to be the rates of occupancy within our skilled nursing facilities. The overall census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2017 was 90.2% compared to 89.5% and 90.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the average length of stay decreasing for a skilled nursing patient, as well as the increased availability of assisted living facilities and home and community-based services, the challenge of maintaining desirable patient census levels has been amplified. Management has undertaken a number of steps in order to best position our current and future health care facilities. This includes working internally to examine and improve systems to be most responsive to referral sources and payors. Additionally, NHC is in various stages of partnerships with hospital systems, payors, and other post-acute alliances in positioning ourselves to be an active participant in the health delivery systems as they develop.\nQuality of Patient Care\nCMS introduced the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities more easily. The Five-Star Quality Rating System gives each skilled nursing operation a rating of between one and five stars in various categories (five stars being the best). The Company has always strived for patient-centered care and quality outcomes as precursors to outstanding financial performance. The average Five-Star rating for all of our skilled nursing facilities was 4.25 for 2017. The table below summarizes our performance in these quality ratings for the most recent three years:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December, 31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total number of skilled nursing facilities, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of 4 and 5-star rated skilled nursing facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of 4 and 5-star rated skilled nursing facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>82% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelopment and Growth\nWe are undertaking to expand our post-acute and senior health care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets. The following table lists our recent construction and purchase activities.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> Type of Operation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Description\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Size\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Location\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Placed in Service\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF/ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 92 beds/60 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gallatin, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> April, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Partnership\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 60 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> St. Peters, MO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> November, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 44 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Charleston, SC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> May, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF/ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 90 beds / 80 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Nashville, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Kingsport, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> September, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 112 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Columbia, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> January, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 78 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bluffton, SC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> March, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 80 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Garden City, SC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 23 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Murfreesboro, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> July, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SNF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 30 units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Springfield, MO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Under construction\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Care\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Bed Addition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 60 beds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Farragut, TN\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Under construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the projects under construction at December 31, 2017, the 30-bed skilled nursing addition in Springfield, Missouri is expected to open during the first quarter of 2018. The 60-bed memory care addition in Farragut, Tennessee is expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDuring 2017, we plan to apply for Certificates of Need for additional beds in certain of our markets. We also will evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building Medicare and private pay health care facilities or private pay assisted living communities.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nIn connection with the enactment of The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $8,488,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017. This estimated benefit was due from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on the new lower corporate income tax rate.\nThis recently passed Tax Act will have a favorable impact on our net income, earnings per share, and operating cash flow in 2018. Like most companies, we continue to evaluate the details within this legislation, but our preliminary estimate indicates our effective tax rate in 2018 should be between 22% to 26% (down from 36% to 39% in prior periods). The Company is evaluating the cash benefit of the Tax Act and believes that it will complement our existing cash usage priorities such as business and capital expenditures that result in growth, dividends to our shareholders, share buybacks, and debt reduction.\nAccrued Risk Reserves\nOur accrued professional liability reserves, workers' compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled $93,275,000 and $91,162,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are a primary area of management focus. We have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities to fund our professional liability and workers' compensation reserves.\nAs to exposure for professional liability claims, we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure, including in-house acquired pressure ulcers, significant weight loss and numbers of falls. These programs for certification, which we regularly modify and improve, have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents. Our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction.\nGovernment Program Financial Changes\nMedicare - Skilled Nursing Facilities\nIn July 2017, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2018 Medicare payments and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2018 final rule provided for an approximate 1.0% rate update, which began October 1, 2017. CMS estimated a 2.7% market basket increase reduced by 0.4% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA; however, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) mandated that all post-acute care providers receive a maximum market basket update of 1% in fiscal year 2018 to offset part of the cost of the legislation. CMS estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2018 by $370 million compared to fiscal year 2017 levels. CMS also revised and rebased the market basket index by updating the base year from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014.\nIn July 2016, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2017 Medicare payments and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2017 final rule provided for an approximate 2.4% rate update, which began October 1, 2016. This increase consisted of a 2.7% market basket increase reduced by 0.3% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA. The policy changes in the 2017 final rule continue to shift skilled nursing facility Medicare payments from volume to value. The final rule makes changes to the SNF Quality Reporting Program and Value-Based Purchasing Program with some of these changes effective for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017.\nFor 2017, our average Medicare per diem rate for skilled nursing facilities increased 1.8% compared to the same period in 2016. No assurances can be given as to whether Congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future, the timing of any action or the form of relief, if any, that may be enacted.\nMedicaid - Skilled Nursing Facilities\nEffective July 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, the state of Tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2018 fiscal year will be approximately $3,600,000 annually, or $900,000 per quarter.\nEffective October 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate changes. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2018 fiscal year will be approximately $1,100,000 annually, or $275,000 per quarter.\nEffective August 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, the state of Missouri approved a Medicaid rate decrease of $5.37 per patient day, or an approximate 3.5% decrease, to Missouri skilled nursing providers. We estimate the resulting decrease in revenue will be approximately $1,400,000 annually, or $350,000 per quarter.\nOverall our average Medicaid per diem increased 2.0 % in 2017 compared to 2016. We face challenges with respect to states' Medicaid payments, because many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients. States will continue to control Medicaid expenditures and also look for adequate funding sources, including provider assessments or increasing state funding for home and community-based services, potentially having an impact on funding for skilled nursing facilities.\nMedicare - Homecare Programs\nIn November 2017 and effective January 1, 2018, CMS released its final rule for 2018 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimated the net impact of the PPS rule resulted in a 0.4% decrease ($80 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2018. This decrease reflects the effects of a 1.0% home health payment update percentage; a -0.97% percent adjustment to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rate to account for nominal case-mix growth; and the sunset of the rural add-on provision for an impact of -0.5%. The rule also finalizes proposals for the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model and the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP). CMS is not finalizing the implementation of the Home Health Groupings Model (HHGM) in this final rule.\nIn October 2016 and effective January 1, 2017, CMS released its final rule for 2017 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimated the net impact of the PPS rule resulted in a 0.7% decrease ($130 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2017. The estimated decrease reflects the effects of a 2.5% home health payment update; rebasing adjustments to the national standardized 60-day episode payment rate, the national per-visit payment rate, and the non-routine medical supplies conversion factor (expected impact of -2.3%), and the effects of an adjustment to the national standardized 60-day episode payment rate to account for nominal case-mix growth (expected impact of -0.9%). However, the freestanding home health agencies were expected to have an overall reduction of 0.8%, and agencies in eight states including the states of South Carolina and Florida were expected to average a reimbursement decrease of 1.9%.\nSegment Reporting\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2017 with the leadership change of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, we reassessed and realigned our reportable operating segments to coincide with the way our new leadership and CODM measures Company performance and allocates resources. The Company has two reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted and independent living facilities, and (2) homecare services. These reportable operating segments are consistent with information used by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as CODM, to assess performance and allocate resources.\nThe Company also reports an all other\u201d category that includes revenues from rental income, management and accounting services fees, insurance services, and costs of the corporate office. The Company has presented the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 on a comparative basis to conform with the current year segment presentation. For additional information on these reportable segments see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nThe Company's CODM evaluates performance and allocates capital resources to each segment based on an operating model that is designed to improve the quality of patient care and profitability of the Company while enhancing long-term shareholder value. The CODM does not review assets by segment in his resource allocation and therefore, assets by segment are not disclosed below.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income by business segment (in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

order to facilitate the comparison of the current year financial performance to the prior year, this summary table highlights the impact of the Tax Act on the Company's 2017 financial performance. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a tax benefit in the amount of $8,488,000 from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on the new lower corporate income tax rate. The two columns in 2017 below outline the financial performance including and excluding the tax reform adjustment, which is in comparison to the 2016 financial performance.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Including tax\nreform\nadjustment\n(GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Excluding\ntax reform\nadjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net operating revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>966,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>966,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>926,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,867 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,669 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to NHC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 include a 4.4% increase in net operating revenues and an 11.2% increase in net income attributable to NHC, which includes the 2017 fourth quarter tax reform adjustment. There have been five newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 (two skilled nursing facilities and three assisted living facilities). The operating losses before income taxes for these entities were approximately $7,003,000 and $3,882,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Therefore, excluding the operating losses from these five newly constructed facilities and the 2017 fourth quarter tax reform benefit, net income attributable to NHC would have been $51,526,000 and $52,906,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe overall average census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2017 was 90.2% compared to 89.5% in 2016. The composite skilled nursing facility per diem increased 2.6% in 2017 compared to 2016. Medicare and Managed Care per diem rates increased 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016. Medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased 2.0% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet patient revenues totaled $919,843,000, an increase of $39,119,000, or 4.4%, compared to the prior year. The newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 helped increase net patient revenues $17,441,000 compared to a year ago. The remaining increase in our net patient revenues is primarily due to the census increase and per diem increases in our existing skilled nursing facility operations.\nOther revenues this year were $47,153,000, an increase of $1,239,000, or 2.7%, as further detailed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Other revenues in 2017 include management and accounting service fees of $16,169,000 ($15,953,000 in 2016), insurance services revenue of $8,003,000 ($7,195,000 in 2016) and rental revenues of $21,957,000 ($21,835,000 in 2016). During the first quarter of 2017, we began management contract services for a third-party owner of two skilled nursing facilities in the middle Tennessee area. These two contracts helped increase management fee and insurance services revenues by $827,000 compared to the prior year.\nTotal costs and expenses for 2017 increased $46,790,000, or 5.4%, to $912,886,000 from $866,096,000 in 2016.\nSalaries, wages and benefits, the largest operating costs of the company, increased $24,036,000, or 4.4%, to $572,043,000 from $548,007,000. These costs were 59.2% and 59.1% of net operating revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 helped increase salaries, wages and benefits by $8,220,000 compared to a year ago. The remaining increase in salaries, wages and benefits in 2017 is due to the increase in our existing skilled nursing facilities and the continued wage pressure in certain markets in which we operate.\nOther operating expenses increased $19,101,000, or 8.2%, to $252,934,000 for 2017 compared to $233,833,000 in 2016. These costs were 26.1% and 25.2% of net operating revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses for 2017 was primarily due to the operations of the newly constructed healthcare facilities compared to a year ago ($9,098,000). We also had unfavorable results within our self-insurance accrued risk reserve programs compared to a year ago ($6,368,000) due to the increase in professional liability lawsuits during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we and/or our managed facilities are currently defendants in 60 claims. At December 31, 2016, we and/or our managed facilities were defendants in 43 claims.\nFacility rent expense decreased $925,000, or 2.2%, to $40,367,000.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 9.3% to $42,652,000. The majority of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the five newly constructed healthcare facilities.\nInterest expense increased $949,000 to $4,890,000 in 2017 from $3,941,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily from the increased interest rate on the line of credit borrowings compared to a year ago. At December 31, 2017, we had $90 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nNon-operating income in 2017 increased $774,000, or 3.9% to $20,439,000, as further detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. The increase in non-operating income is primarily from the sale of the 83-unit assisted living facility in Evans, Georgia during the third quarter of 2017 in which we had an equity method investment and 10% ownership stake. This sale transaction increased non-operating income $1,310,000 in comparison to a year ago. We also received approximately $250,000 annually in management services revenue from this entity, in which we no longer provided management services after September 30, 2017.\nThe noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is the joint venture operations of a skilled nursing facility in Columbia, Tennessee. This facility opened and began operating in January 2017 in which NHC owns 80% of the operating entity and Maury Regional Medical Center owns 20% of the entity.\nThe income tax provision for 2017 is $18,867,000 (an effective income tax rate of 25.3%). As stated above, we recorded a tax benefit of $8,488,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the U.S. tax reform legislation. This estimated benefit was due from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower federal corporate income tax rate. The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2017 were also favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,753,000 or 2.4% of income before taxes in 2017.\nThe income tax provision for 2016 is $29,669,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.0%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2016 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,368,000 or 1.7% of income before taxes in 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 include a 2.2% increase in net operating revenues and a 9.1% increase in net income available to common stockholders. There have been four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2015 and 2016 (two skilled nursing facilities and two assisted living facilities). The operating losses before income taxes for these entities were approximately $7,583,000 and $3,705,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, excluding the operating losses from these four newly constructed facilities, net income attributable to NHC would have been $55,164,000 and $48,584,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe overall average census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2016 was 89.5% compared to 90.0% in 2015. The composite skilled nursing facility per diem increased 1.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. Medicare and Managed Care per diem rates increased 2.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. Medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet patient revenues totaled $880,724,000, an increase of $15,878,000, or 1.8%, compared to the prior year. The majority of the increase in net patient revenues was derived from the four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016 ($10,491,000). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded revenue of $1,374,000 for the settlement and the withdrawal of our administrative appeals process with South Carolina Health and Human Services surrounding the audit of our 2013 and 2014 cost reports.\nOther revenues this year were $45,914,000, an increase of $4,138,000, or 9.9%, as further detailed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Other revenues in 2016 include management and accounting service fees of $15,953,000 ($14,586,000 in 2015), insurance services revenue of $7,195,000 ($7,012,000 in 2015) and rental revenues of $21,835,000 ($19,191,000 in 2015).\nAs to rental revenues, effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a new triple net lease agreement for 11 of the 13 healthcare properties that we own and lease to third party operators. The new lease agreement is for a ten-year period and increased rental income for the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $2,283,000 over 2015 and the previous lease agreement.\nTotal costs and expenses for 2016 increased $26,600,000, or 3.2%, to $866,096,000 from $839,496,000 in 2015.\nSalaries, wages and benefits, the largest operating costs of the company, increased $15,272,000, or 2.9%, to $548,007,000 from $532,735,000. These costs were 59.1% and 58.8% of net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was derived from our same-facility nursing centers ($7,353,000), which was to retain and attract quality partners. The remaining increase in salaries and wages in 2016 was from the four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016 ($6,527,000).\nOther operating expenses increased $6,761,000, or 3.0%, to $233,833,000 for 2016 compared to $227,072,000 in 2015. These costs were 25.2% and 25.0% of net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily due to the increased general and professional liability costs ($3,380,000). As of December 31, 2016, we and/or our managed facilities are currently defendants in 43 claims. At December 31, 2015, we and/or our managed facilities were defendants in 32 claims. In addition to the increased professional liability costs, the remaining other operating expense increase was derived from the new operations of the four healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016.\nFacility rent expense increased $1,325,000, or 3.3%, to $41,292,000.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 5.1% to $39,023,000. The majority of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the four newly constructed healthcare facilities.\nInterest expense increased $1,333,000 to $3,941,000 in 2016 from $2,608,000 in 2015. The increase in interest expense is due from twelve months of borrowings on the credit facility compared to just two months of borrowings during 2015. The Company's Preferred Stock was redeemed in November 2015; therefore, initiating the borrowings on the credit facility. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $110 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nNon-operating income in 2016 increased $1,517,000, or 8.4%, to $19,665,000, as further detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. The increase in non-operating income is primarily from the increased equity in earnings from our geriatric psychiatric hospital in Osage Beach, Missouri ($1,416,000).\nThe income tax provision for 2016 is $29,669,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.0%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2016 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,368,000 or 1.7% of income before taxes in 2016.\nThe income tax provision for 2015 was $32,131,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.7%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2015 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $2,141,000 or 2.5% of income before taxes in 2015.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur primary sources of cash include revenues from the healthcare and senior living facilities we operate, homecare services, insurance services, management services and accounting services. Our primary uses of cash include salaries, wages and benefits, operating costs of the healthcare facilities, the cost of additions to and acquisitions of real property, rent expenses, and dividend distributions. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/15\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,104 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,560 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,476 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,476 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72,784 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,692 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,131 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,943 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,131 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,675 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $94,466,000 as compared to $90,882,000 and $83,355,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $55,682,000, adjustments for non-cash items of $44,872,000, gains on the sale of marketable securities of $262,000, and cash distributions in excess of earnings from equity method investments of $897,000. There was cash used for working capital needs in the amount of $6,723,000 in 2017 compared to $10,553,000 and $14,913,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2017, working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accounts receivable of $9,492,000. The increase in accounts receivable is from the new operations of the five healthcare facilities that began operating during the 2016 and 2017 years.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $9,560,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $81,476,000 and $72,784,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash used for property and equipment additions was $32,347,000, $62,601,000, and $58,416,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of restricted marketable securities, net of purchases, resulted in positive cash flow in 2017 of $18,953,000. This is compared to a net use of cash from the purchasing of restricted marketable securities in the amount of $13,978,000 and $12,966,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2017, construction costs included in additions to property and equipment include $2,502,000 for the construction and completion of the 112-bed skilled nursing facility in Columbia, Tennessee that began operations in 2017, which is the partnership between NHC and Maury Regional Medical Center; $3,337,000 for the final construction and furnishings of the two assisted living facilities in South Carolina that began operations in 2017; $3,865,000 for the construction and completion of the 23 unit memory care addition located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee that opened during the third quarter of 2017; and $3,728,000 for the construction of the 30 bed addition to a skilled nursing facility in Springfield, Missouri that will begin operations in 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $49,074,000, $27,131,000 and $41,675,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, $20,000,000 was used to pay down the outstanding principal balance on our credit facility. Dividends paid to common stockholders for the 2017 and 2016 years were $28,237,000 and $25,795,000, respectively. For the 2015 year, $30,075,000 was used to pay dividends to the Company's common and preferred stockholders. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options, totaled $2,524,000 in 2017 compared to $10,772,000 and $10,634,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. On August 5, 2016, the Company repurchased 130,000 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $8,195,000.\nIn November 2015, the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of $15.75 per share. The mandatory redemption required the Company to pay stockholders approximately $130,538,000, of which $110,000,000 of the funding came from borrowings under our credit facility. Therefore, the Company used approximately $20,538,000 of cash for the redemption of the Preferred Stock.\nTable of Contractual Cash Obligations\nOur contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to December 31, 2017 are as follows (in 000's):\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt - interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,914 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>345,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term liquidity\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities. In addition to cash flows from operations, our current cash on hand of $59,118,000, marketable securities of $139,085,000 and as needed, our borrowing capacity on the credit facility, are expected to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, operating liquidity, and our growth and development plans in the next twelve months.\nLong-term liquidity\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities, our current cash on hand of $59,118,000, marketable securities of $139,085,000, and our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance on the credit facility is $90,000,000; therefore, leaving $85,000,000 available for future borrowings. The maturity date on the credit facility is October 7, 2020. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions.\nOur ability to refinance the credit agreement, to meet our long-term contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements, growth and development plans will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, financial and other factors, including potential changes in state and federal government payment rates for health care, customer demand, success of our marketing efforts, pressures from competitors, and the state of the economy, including the state of financial and credit markets.\nContingencies\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has remained relatively low during the past three years. However, rates paid under the Medicare and Medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs. Therefore, there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs.\nSee Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pending litigation and other contingencies.\nGuarantees\nAt December 31, 2017, we have no agreements to guarantee the debt obligations of other parties.\nWe have no outstanding letters of credit. We may or may not in the future elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure in the future. At December 31, 2017, we did not participate in any such financial investments.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nOur critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition - Third Party Payors\nMedicare and Medicaid program revenues, as well as certain Managed Care program revenues, are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives or their agents. In our opinion, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews. Any differences between our original estimates of reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected in operations in the period in which the revisions are made often due to final determination or the period of payment no longer being subject to audit or review. We have made provisions of approximately $17,389,000 and $17,019,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for various Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care claims reviews and current and prior year cost reports.\nRevenue Recognition - Private Pay\nFor private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities, we bill room and board charges for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed. Charges for ancillary, pharmacy, therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services; however, all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed.\nRevenue Recognition - Subordination of Fees and Uncertain Collections\nWe provide management services to healthcare operators and to others we provide accounting and financial services. We generally charge 6% of net operating revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services. Our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided. However, under the terms of our management contracts, payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long-term care center being managed. Furthermore, for certain of the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined, based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, that collection is not reasonably assured, our policy is to recognize revenues only in the period in which the amounts are realized. We may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers or proceeds from the sale of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees. There can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur. The realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a skilled nursing or assisted living facility and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful. We may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit. Also, we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center.\nAccrued Risk Reserves\nWe are self-insured for risks related to health insurance and have wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies that insure risks related to workers' compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy is to engage an external, independent actuary to assist in estimating our exposure for claims obligations (for both asserted and unasserted claims). We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis.\nProfessional liability remains an area of particular concern to us. The long-term care industry has seen an increase in personal injury/wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by skilled nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2017, we and/or our managed centers are defendants in 60 claims. It remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. It is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe are principally self-insured for incidents occurring in all centers owned or leased by us. The coverages include both primary policies and excess policies. In all years, settlements, if any, in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nNational HealthCare Corporation, which we also refer to as NHC or the Company, is a leading provider of post-acute care and senior health care services. At December 31, 2017 we operate or manage 76 skilled nursing facilities with 9,597 licensed beds, 24 assisted living facilities, five independent living facilities, and 36 homecare programs located in 10 states. These operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries. We have a non-controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services NHC owned health care centers and others. In addition, we provide management services, accounting and financial services, and insurance services to third party operators of healthcare properties. We also own the real estate of 13 healthcare properties and lease these properties to third party operators.\nExecutive Summary\nEarnings\nTo monitor our earnings, we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor, census, and the composition of revenues. Inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline.\nOccupancy\nA primary area of management focus continues to be the rates of occupancy within our skilled nursing facilities. The overall census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2017 was 90.2% compared to 89.5% and 90.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the average length of stay decreasing for a skilled nursing patient, as well as the increased availability of assisted living facilities and home and community-based services, the challenge of maintaining desirable patient census levels has been amplified. Management has undertaken a number of steps in order to best position our current and future health care facilities. This includes working internally to examine and improve systems to be most responsive to referral sources and payors. Additionally, NHC is in various stages of partnerships with hospital systems, payors, and other post-acute alliances in positioning ourselves to be an active participant in the health delivery systems as they develop.\nQuality of Patient Care\nCMS introduced the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities more easily. The Five-Star Quality Rating System gives each skilled nursing operation a rating of between one and five stars in various categories (five stars being the best). The Company has always strived for patient-centered care and quality outcomes as precursors to outstanding financial performance. The average Five-Star rating for all of our skilled nursing facilities was 4.25 for 2017. The table below summarizes our performance in these quality ratings for the most recent three years:\n\nDevelopment and Growth\nWe are undertaking to expand our post-acute and senior health care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets. The following table lists our recent construction and purchase activities.\n\nFor the projects under construction at December 31, 2017, the 30-bed skilled nursing addition in Springfield, Missouri is expected to open during the first quarter of 2018. The 60-bed memory care addition in Farragut, Tennessee is expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDuring 2017, we plan to apply for Certificates of Need for additional beds in certain of our markets. We also will evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building Medicare and private pay health care facilities or private pay assisted living communities.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nIn connection with the enactment of The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $8,488,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017. This estimated benefit was due from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on the new lower corporate income tax rate.\nThis recently passed Tax Act will have a favorable impact on our net income, earnings per share, and operating cash flow in 2018. Like most companies, we continue to evaluate the details within this legislation, but our preliminary estimate indicates our effective tax rate in 2018 should be between 22% to 26% (down from 36% to 39% in prior periods). The Company is evaluating the cash benefit of the Tax Act and believes that it will complement our existing cash usage priorities such as business and capital expenditures that result in growth, dividends to our shareholders, share buybacks, and debt reduction.\nAccrued Risk Reserves\nOur accrued professional liability reserves, workers' compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled $93,275,000 and $91,162,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are a primary area of management focus. We have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities to fund our professional liability and workers' compensation reserves.\nAs to exposure for professional liability claims, we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure, including in-house acquired pressure ulcers, significant weight loss and numbers of falls. These programs for certification, which we regularly modify and improve, have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents. Our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction.\nGovernment Program Financial Changes\nMedicare - Skilled Nursing Facilities\nIn July 2017, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2018 Medicare payments and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2018 final rule provided for an approximate 1.0% rate update, which began October 1, 2017. CMS estimated a 2.7% market basket increase reduced by 0.4% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA; however, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) mandated that all post-acute care providers receive a maximum market basket update of 1% in fiscal year 2018 to offset part of the cost of the legislation. CMS estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2018 by $370 million compared to fiscal year 2017 levels. CMS also revised and rebased the market basket index by updating the base year from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014.\nIn July 2016, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2017 Medicare payments and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2017 final rule provided for an approximate 2.4% rate update, which began October 1, 2016. This increase consisted of a 2.7% market basket increase reduced by 0.3% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA. The policy changes in the 2017 final rule continue to shift skilled nursing facility Medicare payments from volume to value. The final rule makes changes to the SNF Quality Reporting Program and Value-Based Purchasing Program with some of these changes effective for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017.\nFor 2017, our average Medicare per diem rate for skilled nursing facilities increased 1.8% compared to the same period in 2016. No assurances can be given as to whether Congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future, the timing of any action or the form of relief, if any, that may be enacted.\nMedicaid - Skilled Nursing Facilities\nEffective July 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, the state of Tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2018 fiscal year will be approximately $3,600,000 annually, or $900,000 per quarter.\nEffective October 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate changes. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2018 fiscal year will be approximately $1,100,000 annually, or $275,000 per quarter.\nEffective August 1, 2017 and for the fiscal year 2018, the state of Missouri approved a Medicaid rate decrease of $5.37 per patient day, or an approximate 3.5% decrease, to Missouri skilled nursing providers. We estimate the resulting decrease in revenue will be approximately $1,400,000 annually, or $350,000 per quarter.\nOverall our average Medicaid per diem increased 2.0 % in 2017 compared to 2016. We face challenges with respect to states' Medicaid payments, because many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients. States will continue to control Medicaid expenditures and also look for adequate funding sources, including provider assessments or increasing state funding for home and community-based services, potentially having an impact on funding for skilled nursing facilities.\nMedicare - Homecare Programs\nIn November 2017 and effective January 1, 2018, CMS released its final rule for 2018 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimated the net impact of the PPS rule resulted in a 0.4% decrease ($80 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2018. This decrease reflects the effects of a 1.0% home health payment update percentage; a -0.97% percent adjustment to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rate to account for nominal case-mix growth; and the sunset of the rural add-on provision for an impact of -0.5%. The rule also finalizes proposals for the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model and the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP). CMS is not finalizing the implementation of the Home Health Groupings Model (HHGM) in this final rule.\nIn October 2016 and effective January 1, 2017, CMS released its final rule for 2017 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimated the net impact of the PPS rule resulted in a 0.7% decrease ($130 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2017. The estimated decrease reflects the effects of a 2.5% home health payment update; rebasing adjustments to the national standardized 60-day episode payment rate, the national per-visit payment rate, and the non-routine medical supplies conversion factor (expected impact of -2.3%), and the effects of an adjustment to the national standardized 60-day episode payment rate to account for nominal case-mix growth (expected impact of -0.9%). However, the freestanding home health agencies were expected to have an overall reduction of 0.8%, and agencies in eight states including the states of South Carolina and Florida were expected to average a reimbursement decrease of 1.9%.\nSegment Reporting\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2017 with the leadership change of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, we reassessed and realigned our reportable operating segments to coincide with the way our new leadership and CODM measures Company performance and allocates resources. The Company has two reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted and independent living facilities, and (2) homecare services. These reportable operating segments are consistent with information used by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as CODM, to assess performance and allocate resources.\nThe Company also reports an all other\u201d category that includes revenues from rental income, management and accounting services fees, insurance services, and costs of the corporate office. The Company has presented the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 on a comparative basis to conform with the current year segment presentation. For additional information on these reportable segments see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nThe Company's CODM evaluates performance and allocates capital resources to each segment based on an operating model that is designed to improve the quality of patient care and profitability of the Company while enhancing long-term shareholder value. The CODM does not review assets by segment in his resource allocation and therefore, assets by segment are not disclosed below.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income by business segment (in thousands):\n\n\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table and discussion sets forth items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nPercentage of Net Operating Revenues\n\nThe following table sets forth the increase or (decrease) in certain items from the consolidated statements of income as compared to the prior period.\nPeriod to Period Increase (Decrease)\n\n2017 Compared to 2016\nIn order to facilitate the comparison of the current year financial performance to the prior year, this summary table highlights the impact of the Tax Act on the Company's 2017 financial performance. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a tax benefit in the amount of $8,488,000 from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on the new lower corporate income tax rate. The two columns in 2017 below outline the financial performance including and excluding the tax reform adjustment, which is in comparison to the 2016 financial performance.\n\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 include a 4.4% increase in net operating revenues and an 11.2% increase in net income attributable to NHC, which includes the 2017 fourth quarter tax reform adjustment. There have been five newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 (two skilled nursing facilities and three assisted living facilities). The operating losses before income taxes for these entities were approximately $7,003,000 and $3,882,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Therefore, excluding the operating losses from these five newly constructed facilities and the 2017 fourth quarter tax reform benefit, net income attributable to NHC would have been $51,526,000 and $52,906,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe overall average census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2017 was 90.2% compared to 89.5% in 2016. The composite skilled nursing facility per diem increased 2.6% in 2017 compared to 2016. Medicare and Managed Care per diem rates increased 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016. Medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased 2.0% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet patient revenues totaled $919,843,000, an increase of $39,119,000, or 4.4%, compared to the prior year. The newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 helped increase net patient revenues $17,441,000 compared to a year ago. The remaining increase in our net patient revenues is primarily due to the census increase and per diem increases in our existing skilled nursing facility operations.\nOther revenues this year were $47,153,000, an increase of $1,239,000, or 2.7%, as further detailed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Other revenues in 2017 include management and accounting service fees of $16,169,000 ($15,953,000 in 2016), insurance services revenue of $8,003,000 ($7,195,000 in 2016) and rental revenues of $21,957,000 ($21,835,000 in 2016). During the first quarter of 2017, we began management contract services for a third-party owner of two skilled nursing facilities in the middle Tennessee area. These two contracts helped increase management fee and insurance services revenues by $827,000 compared to the prior year.\nTotal costs and expenses for 2017 increased $46,790,000, or 5.4%, to $912,886,000 from $866,096,000 in 2016.\nSalaries, wages and benefits, the largest operating costs of the company, increased $24,036,000, or 4.4%, to $572,043,000 from $548,007,000. These costs were 59.2% and 59.1% of net operating revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2016 and 2017 helped increase salaries, wages and benefits by $8,220,000 compared to a year ago. The remaining increase in salaries, wages and benefits in 2017 is due to the increase in our existing skilled nursing facilities and the continued wage pressure in certain markets in which we operate.\nOther operating expenses increased $19,101,000, or 8.2%, to $252,934,000 for 2017 compared to $233,833,000 in 2016. These costs were 26.1% and 25.2% of net operating revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses for 2017 was primarily due to the operations of the newly constructed healthcare facilities compared to a year ago ($9,098,000). We also had unfavorable results within our self-insurance accrued risk reserve programs compared to a year ago ($6,368,000) due to the increase in professional liability lawsuits during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we and/or our managed facilities are currently defendants in 60 claims. At December 31, 2016, we and/or our managed facilities were defendants in 43 claims.\nFacility rent expense decreased $925,000, or 2.2%, to $40,367,000.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 9.3% to $42,652,000. The majority of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the five newly constructed healthcare facilities.\nInterest expense increased $949,000 to $4,890,000 in 2017 from $3,941,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily from the increased interest rate on the line of credit borrowings compared to a year ago. At December 31, 2017, we had $90 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nNon-operating income in 2017 increased $774,000, or 3.9% to $20,439,000, as further detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. The increase in non-operating income is primarily from the sale of the 83-unit assisted living facility in Evans, Georgia during the third quarter of 2017 in which we had an equity method investment and 10% ownership stake. This sale transaction increased non-operating income $1,310,000 in comparison to a year ago. We also received approximately $250,000 annually in management services revenue from this entity, in which we no longer provided management services after September 30, 2017.\nThe noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is the joint venture operations of a skilled nursing facility in Columbia, Tennessee. This facility opened and began operating in January 2017 in which NHC owns 80% of the operating entity and Maury Regional Medical Center owns 20% of the entity.\nThe income tax provision for 2017 is $18,867,000 (an effective income tax rate of 25.3%). As stated above, we recorded a tax benefit of $8,488,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the U.S. tax reform legislation. This estimated benefit was due from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower federal corporate income tax rate. The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2017 were also favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,753,000 or 2.4% of income before taxes in 2017.\nThe income tax provision for 2016 is $29,669,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.0%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2016 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,368,000 or 1.7% of income before taxes in 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 include a 2.2% increase in net operating revenues and a 9.1% increase in net income available to common stockholders. There have been four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service during 2015 and 2016 (two skilled nursing facilities and two assisted living facilities). The operating losses before income taxes for these entities were approximately $7,583,000 and $3,705,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, excluding the operating losses from these four newly constructed facilities, net income attributable to NHC would have been $55,164,000 and $48,584,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe overall average census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for 2016 was 89.5% compared to 90.0% in 2015. The composite skilled nursing facility per diem increased 1.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. Medicare and Managed Care per diem rates increased 2.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. Medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet patient revenues totaled $880,724,000, an increase of $15,878,000, or 1.8%, compared to the prior year. The majority of the increase in net patient revenues was derived from the four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016 ($10,491,000). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded revenue of $1,374,000 for the settlement and the withdrawal of our administrative appeals process with South Carolina Health and Human Services surrounding the audit of our 2013 and 2014 cost reports.\nOther revenues this year were $45,914,000, an increase of $4,138,000, or 9.9%, as further detailed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Other revenues in 2016 include management and accounting service fees of $15,953,000 ($14,586,000 in 2015), insurance services revenue of $7,195,000 ($7,012,000 in 2015) and rental revenues of $21,835,000 ($19,191,000 in 2015).\nAs to rental revenues, effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a new triple net lease agreement for 11 of the 13 healthcare properties that we own and lease to third party operators. The new lease agreement is for a ten-year period and increased rental income for the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $2,283,000 over 2015 and the previous lease agreement.\nTotal costs and expenses for 2016 increased $26,600,000, or 3.2%, to $866,096,000 from $839,496,000 in 2015.\nSalaries, wages and benefits, the largest operating costs of the company, increased $15,272,000, or 2.9%, to $548,007,000 from $532,735,000. These costs were 59.1% and 58.8% of net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was derived from our same-facility nursing centers ($7,353,000), which was to retain and attract quality partners. The remaining increase in salaries and wages in 2016 was from the four newly constructed healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016 ($6,527,000).\nOther operating expenses increased $6,761,000, or 3.0%, to $233,833,000 for 2016 compared to $227,072,000 in 2015. These costs were 25.2% and 25.0% of net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily due to the increased general and professional liability costs ($3,380,000). As of December 31, 2016, we and/or our managed facilities are currently defendants in 43 claims. At December 31, 2015, we and/or our managed facilities were defendants in 32 claims. In addition to the increased professional liability costs, the remaining other operating expense increase was derived from the new operations of the four healthcare facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016.\nFacility rent expense increased $1,325,000, or 3.3%, to $41,292,000.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 5.1% to $39,023,000. The majority of the increase in depreciation expense is due to the four newly constructed healthcare facilities.\nInterest expense increased $1,333,000 to $3,941,000 in 2016 from $2,608,000 in 2015. The increase in interest expense is due from twelve months of borrowings on the credit facility compared to just two months of borrowings during 2015. The Company's Preferred Stock was redeemed in November 2015; therefore, initiating the borrowings on the credit facility. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $110 million outstanding on our credit facility.\nNon-operating income in 2016 increased $1,517,000, or 8.4%, to $19,665,000, as further detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. The increase in non-operating income is primarily from the increased equity in earnings from our geriatric psychiatric hospital in Osage Beach, Missouri ($1,416,000).\nThe income tax provision for 2016 is $29,669,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.0%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2016 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $1,368,000 or 1.7% of income before taxes in 2016.\nThe income tax provision for 2015 was $32,131,000 (an effective income tax rate of 37.7%). The income tax provision and effective tax rate for 2015 were favorably impacted by statute of limitation expirations resulting in a benefit to the provision of $2,141,000 or 2.5% of income before taxes in 2015.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur primary sources of cash include revenues from the healthcare and senior living facilities we operate, homecare services, insurance services, management services and accounting services. Our primary uses of cash include salaries, wages and benefits, operating costs of the healthcare facilities, the cost of additions to and acquisitions of real property, rent expenses, and dividend distributions. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows (dollars in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $94,466,000 as compared to $90,882,000 and $83,355,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $55,682,000, adjustments for non-cash items of $44,872,000, gains on the sale of marketable securities of $262,000, and cash distributions in excess of earnings from equity method investments of $897,000. There was cash used for working capital needs in the amount of $6,723,000 in 2017 compared to $10,553,000 and $14,913,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2017, working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accounts receivable of $9,492,000. The increase in accounts receivable is from the new operations of the five healthcare facilities that began operating during the 2016 and 2017 years.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $9,560,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $81,476,000 and $72,784,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash used for property and equipment additions was $32,347,000, $62,601,000, and $58,416,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of restricted marketable securities, net of purchases, resulted in positive cash flow in 2017 of $18,953,000. This is compared to a net use of cash from the purchasing of restricted marketable securities in the amount of $13,978,000 and $12,966,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn 2017, construction costs included in additions to property and equipment include $2,502,000 for the construction and completion of the 112-bed skilled nursing facility in Columbia, Tennessee that began operations in 2017, which is the partnership between NHC and Maury Regional Medical Center; $3,337,000 for the final construction and furnishings of the two assisted living facilities in South Carolina that began operations in 2017; $3,865,000 for the construction and completion of the 23 unit memory care addition located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee that opened during the third quarter of 2017; and $3,728,000 for the construction of the 30 bed addition to a skilled nursing facility in Springfield, Missouri that will begin operations in 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $49,074,000, $27,131,000 and $41,675,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, $20,000,000 was used to pay down the outstanding principal balance on our credit facility. Dividends paid to common stockholders for the 2017 and 2016 years were $28,237,000 and $25,795,000, respectively. For the 2015 year, $30,075,000 was used to pay dividends to the Company's common and preferred stockholders. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options, totaled $2,524,000 in 2017 compared to $10,772,000 and $10,634,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. On August 5, 2016, the Company repurchased 130,000 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $8,195,000.\nIn November 2015, the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of $15.75 per share. The mandatory redemption required the Company to pay stockholders approximately $130,538,000, of which $110,000,000 of the funding came from borrowings under our credit facility. Therefore, the Company used approximately $20,538,000 of cash for the redemption of the Preferred Stock.\nTable of Contractual Cash Obligations\nOur contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to December 31, 2017 are as follows (in 000's):\n\nShort-term liquidity\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities. In addition to cash flows from operations, our current cash on hand of $59,118,000, marketable securities of $139,085,000 and as needed, our borrowing capacity on the credit facility, are expected to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, operating liquidity, and our growth and development plans in the next twelve months.\nLong-term liquidity\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities, our current cash on hand of $59,118,000, marketable securities of $139,085,000, and our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance on the credit facility is $90,000,000; therefore, leaving $85,000,000 available for future borrowings. The maturity date on the credit facility is October 7, 2020. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions.\nOur ability to refinance the credit agreement, to meet our long-term contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements, growth and development plans will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, financial and other factors, including potential changes in state and federal government payment rates for health care, customer demand, success of our marketing efforts, pressures from competitors, and the state of the economy, including the state of financial and credit markets.\nContingencies\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has remained relatively low during the past three years. However, rates paid under the Medicare and Medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs. Therefore, there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs.\nSee Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pending litigation and other contingencies.\nGuarantees\nAt December 31, 2017, we have no agreements to guarantee the debt obligations of other parties.\nWe have no outstanding letters of credit. We may or may not in the future elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure in the future. At December 31, 2017, we did not participate in any such financial investments.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nOur critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition - Third Party Payors\nMedicare and Medicaid program revenues, as well as certain Managed Care program revenues, are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives or their agents. In our opinion, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews. Any differences between our original estimates of reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected in operations in the period in which the revisions are made often due to final determination or the period of payment no longer being subject to audit or review. We have made provisions of approximately $17,389,000 and $17,019,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for various Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care claims reviews and current and prior year cost reports.\nRevenue Recognition - Private Pay\nFor private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities, we bill room and board charges for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed. Charges for ancillary, pharmacy, therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services; however, all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed.\nRevenue Recognition - Subordination of Fees and Uncertain Collections\nWe provide management services to healthcare operators and to others we provide accounting and financial services. We generally charge 6% of net operating revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services. Our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided. However, under the terms of our management contracts, payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long-term care center being managed. Furthermore, for certain of the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined, based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, that collection is not reasonably assured, our policy is to recognize revenues only in the period in which the amounts are realized. We may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers or proceeds from the sale of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees. There can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur. The realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a skilled nursing or assisted living facility and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful. We may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit. Also, we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center.\nAccrued Risk Reserves\nWe are self-insured for risks related to health insurance and have wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies that insure risks related to workers' compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy is to engage an external, independent actuary to assist in estimating our exposure for claims obligations (for both asserted and unasserted claims). We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis.\nProfessional liability remains an area of particular concern to us. The long-term care industry has seen an increase in personal injury/wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by skilled nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2017, we and/or our managed centers are defendants in 60 claims. It remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. It is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe are principally self-insured for incidents occurring in all centers owned or leased by us. The coverages include both primary policies and excess policies. In all years, settlements, if any, in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 66: <table> <tr>

HealthCare Corporation. The key points are:\n\nOverview\n- NHC is a leading provider of post-acute care and senior health care services, operating 76 skilled nursing facilities, 24 assisted living facilities, and other services across 10 states. \n- Key focus areas are quality of care, occupancy rates, development and growth through expansion and acquisitions, and managing the impact of changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\n2017 Financial Performance\n- Net operating revenues increased 4.4% to $967 million.\n- Net income increased 10.2% to $55.7 million, aided by an $8.5 million tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n- 5 new healthcare facilities opened in 2016-2017 contributed to revenue growth but also had $7 million in operating losses.\n- Excluding new facility losses and tax benefit, net income was down 8.9% due to higher costs. \n- Overall census in skilled nursing facilities increased to 90.2% from 89.5%.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Cash from operations was $94.5 million. Cash and investments totaled $198 million.\n- $20 million was used pay down debt. Dividends were $28 million.  \n- Capital expenditures were $32 million, including expansions to existing facilities.\n\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\n- Revenues subject to adjustment following Medicare/Medicaid audits. $17 million is reserved for potential audit adjustments. \n- Self-insured for health insurance and workers comp claims. Engages actuary to estimate claim reserves.\n- Professional liability claims are increasing, reserves could be exceeded.\n\nSo in summary, NHC continued expanding but also faced margin pressures and increasing costs in 2017. Maintaining quality and occupancy remains a key priority. Liquidity position seems adequate. Reliance on actuarial estimates introduces some uncertainty into reported financials."}
