We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d under ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d in this document. In addition, the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nIn prior periods, our consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Actavis, Inc., and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. On May 16, 2013, Actavis plc (formally known as Actavis Limited) was incorporated in Ireland as a private limited company and re-registered effective September 20, 2013 as a public limited company. It was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott. On October 1, 2013, Actavis plc became the successor registrant of Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott in connection with the consummation of certain transactions further described elsewhere in this document. In addition, on October 1, 2013, the shares of Actavis plc began trading on the NYSE under the symbol ACT,\u201d the same symbol under which Actavis, Inc.'s shares previously traded. On March 17, 2015, Actavis, plc completed the acquisition of Allergan, Inc. On June 15, 2015, Actavis plc changed its name to Allergan plc and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol AGN\u201d. References throughout to ordinary shares\u201d refer to Actavis, Inc.'s Class A common shares, par value $0.0033 per share, prior to the consummation of the Transactions and to our ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, since the consummation of the Transactions. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan. Due to the deminimis activity between Allergan and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this section relate to both Allergan and Warner Chilcott.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOverview\nAllergan plc is a global specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of brand name, medical aesthetics, generic, branded generic, biosimilar and over-the-counter OTC pharmaceutical products. The Company has operations in more than 100 countries. Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc and has the same principal business activities. As a result of the Allergan Acquisition which closed on March 17, 2015, the Company expanded its franchises to include ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery, which complements the Company's existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women's health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits from Legacy Allergan's global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox\u00ae and Restasis\u00ae. The Allergan Acquisition also expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.\nWe have supported our business with a significant commitment to R&D expenditures. Our global growth strategy is focused on: (i) internal development of differentiated high-demand products; (ii) establishment of strategic alliances and collaborations that bring new products, technologies and markets to our existing portfolio; and (iii) acquisition of products and/or companies that complement our existing portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we marketed close to 100 branded pharmaceutical product families in the U.S. and a significant number of product families internationally. Branded pharmaceutical products are marketed under brand names through programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Through our Anda Distribution segment, we distribute approximately 13,200 SKUs in the U.S. primarily to independent pharmacies, alternate care providers (hospitals, nursing homes and mail order pharmacies) and pharmacy chains.\nOn July 26, 2015, Allergan plc entered into the Teva Agreement, under which Teva agreed to acquire the Company's global generic pharmaceuticals business and certain other assets. Under the Teva Agreement, upon the closing of the Teva Transaction, we will receive $33.75 billion in cash and 100.3 million Teva ordinary shares (or American Depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximates $6.75 billion in Teva stock using the then-current stock price at the time the Teva Transaction was announced, in exchange for which Teva will acquire our global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R&D unit, our international over-the-counter (OTC) commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands. We continue to work toward satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016; however, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter.\nOn November 23, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into the Pfizer Agreement under which Pfizer, a global innovative biopharmaceutical company, and Allergan plc will merge in the Pfizer Transaction, which attributes a $160.0 billion enterprise valuation using the then-current stock price at the time the Pfizer Transaction was announced. Company shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company ordinary shares for each of their existing Allergan shares and Pfizer stockholders will receive in respect of each share of Pfizer common stock held by them, at their election and subject to certain proration procedures described in the Pfizer Agreement, either one share of the combined company or an amount in cash equal to the volume weighted average price per share of Pfizer common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the consummation of the Pfizer Transaction. The Pfizer Transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2016.\n2015 Significant Business Developments\nThe following are the material transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAcquisitions\nAqueSys\nOn October 16, 2015, the Company completed the AqueSys Acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired XEN45, a soft shunt that is implanted in the sub conjunctival space in the eye through a minimally invasive procedure with a single use, pre-loaded proprietary injector. The AqueSys Acquisition had deminimis impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNorthwood Medical Innovation\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company acquired earFold\u2122 which is a medical device for the correction of prominent ears, with or without asymmetry, in patients aged 7 years and older. The Northwood Acquisition had deminimis impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nKythera\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company completed the Kythera Acquisition. Kythera was focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel prescription aesthetic products. Kythera's lead product, Kybella\u00ae injection, is the first and only FDA approved, non-surgical treatment for moderate to severe submental fullness, commonly referred to as double chin. The Company included the results of Kythera in its Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning October 1, 2015, including $77.2 million in stock compensation expense.\nOculeve\nOn August 10, 2015, the Company completed the Oculeve Acquisition. The Company acquired Oculeve and its lead product candidate OD-01, an intranasal neurostimulation device, as well as other dry eye products in development. The Oculeve Acquisition had deminimis impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAuden Mckenzie\nOn May 29, 2015, the Company completed the Auden Acquisition. The assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the results of operations for the acquired Auden business are part of the assets being divested in the Teva Transaction and are included as a component of income from discontinued operations. In addition, the acquired financial position is included in assets and liabilities held for sale.\nAllergan\nOn March 17, 2015, the Company completed the Allergan Acquisition. The addition of Legacy Allergan's therapeutic franchises in ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery complements the Company's existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women's health and urology franchises. The combined company benefited from Legacy Allergan's global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox\u00ae and Restasis\u00ae. The transaction also expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.\nThe contribution from the acquisition of Legacy Allergan for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows ($ in

The consideration was accounted for as an asset acquisition and included as a component of intangible assets.\nNaurex\nOn August 28, 2015, the Company incurred $571.7 million of R&D expenses associated with the Naurex Transaction. The Naurex Transaction expands our pipeline with Naurex's two leading product candidates GLYX-13 and NRX-1074, two compounds that utilize NMDA modulation as a potential new approach to the treatment of MDD, a disease that can lead to suicidality among the most severe patients.\nMigraine License\nOn August 6, 2015, the Company incurred $250.0 million of R&D expenses associated with the Merck Transaction.\nDivestitures\nRespiratory Business\nAs a result of the Respiratory Sale in the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized an incremental charge in cost of sales (including the acquisition accounting fair value mark-up of inventory) relating to inventory that will not be sold to AstraZeneca of $35.3 million.

On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that the European Commission has granted Allergan's subsidiary Durata Therapeutics International B.V., marketing authorization for Xydalba\u2122 (dalbavancin) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. The approval triggered the first CVR payment. The difference between the fair value of the CVR on the date of acquisition of $24.5 million and the payment made of $30.9 million, or $6.4 million, was recorded as an operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2015. In January 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for an expanded label which will include a single dose of Dalvance\u00ae, which triggers a second CVR payment in the year ending December 31, 2016.\nFuriex\nOn July 2, 2014, the Company completed the Furiex Acquisition. In the second quarter of 2015, the Company received approval from the FDA of the eluxadoline product, Viberzi\u00ae.\nViberzi\u00ae is a first-in-class, locally-acting mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist for treating symptoms of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d), a condition that affects approximately 28 million patients in the United States and Europe. In connection with the close of the Furiex Acquisition, the Company further announced that it closed the transaction related to the sale of Furiex's royalties on Alogliptin and Priligy\u00ae to Royalty Pharma for $408.6 million in cash consideration.\nContingent Consideration\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received a schedule IV ( C-IV\u201d) designation from the DEA for Viberzi\u00ae and recognized an expense of $29.8 million as a component of R&D expense. This expense represents the difference between the final CVR payment amount of $118.5 million, or $10 for each CVR outstanding, versus the probability-weighted CVR fair value initially established in acquisition accounting adjusted for accretion. This amount was paid as of December 31, 2015.\nForest Laboratories\nOn July 1, 2014, the Company completed the Forest Acquisition. Forest was a leading, fully integrated, specialty pharmaceutical company largely focused on the United States market. Legacy Forest marketed a portfolio of branded drug products and developed new medicines to treat patients suffering from diseases principally in the following therapeutic areas: central nervous system, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, anti-infective, and cystic fibrosis.\nThe contribution from the acquisition of Forest for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows ($ in

1, 2014, the Company completed the Silom Acquisition. The Silom Acquisition expanded the Company's position in the Thai generic pharmaceutical market, with leading positions in the ophthalmic and respiratory therapeutic categories and a strong cardiovascular franchise. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the results of operations for the acquired Silom business are part of the assets being divested in the Teva Transaction and are included as a component of income from discontinued operations. In addition the acquired financial position is included in assets and liabilities held for sale.\nDivestitures\nCorona Facility\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we held for sale assets in our Corona, California manufacturing facility. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge as a component of discontinued operations of $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, including a write-off of property, plant and equipment, net, due to the integration of Warner Chilcott of $5.8 million.\n2013 Significant Business Developments\nThe following are the material transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAcquisitions\nWarner Chilcott\nOn October 1, 2013, the Company completed the Warner Chilcott Acquisition.

sell and distribute Medicines360 LNG20 in the U.S. and in Canada for a payment of approximately $52.3 million. According to the terms of the agreement, we are also required to pay Medicines360 certain regulatory and sales based milestone payments totaling up to nearly $125.0 million plus royalties. Medicines360 retained the rights to market the product in the U.S. public sector, including family planning clinics that provide services to low-income women. LNG20 is currently marketed as Liletta\u00ae and was originally developed by Uteron Pharma Operations SPRL in Belgium (now a subsidiary of the Company). We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nAcquisition of Uteron Pharma, S.A.\nOn January 23, 2013, the Company completed the Uteron Acquisition. The acquisition expanded the Company's specialty brand pipeline of women's health products including two potential near term commercial opportunities in contraception and infertility, and one oral contraceptive project projected to launch by 2018 at the time of the acquisition. Several additional products that were then in earlier stages of development were also acquired in the Uteron Acquisition. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nAt June 30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Estelle, a novel natural estrogen-based 28 day cycle oral contraceptive for the prevention of pregnancy, of $13.1 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently, the $22.8 million contingent liability related to Estelle was written off, resulting in a net gain of $9.7 million. At June 30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Colvir, a treatment of premalignant Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) lesions of the uterine, of $2.0 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently the $1.5 million contingent liability was also written off, resulting in a net loss of $0.5 million.\nDivestitures\nWestern European Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we held for sale our then current generic commercial infrastructure in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, including products, marketing authorizations and dossier license rights. On January 17, 2014, we announced our intention to enter into an agreement with Aurobindo to sell these businesses. On April 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of the assets in Western Europe.\nIn connection with the sale of our Western European assets, we entered into a supply agreement whereby the Company will supply product to Aurobindo over a period of five years. In the second quarter of 2014, we allocated the fair value of the consideration for the sale of the Western European assets of $65.0 million to each element of the agreement, including the supply of product.\nAs a result of the transactions, we recognized as a component of discontinued operations, income / (loss) on the net assets held for sale of $3.4 million and $(34.3) million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a loss on the disposal of the assets within discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2014 of $20.9 million and deferred revenue of $10.1 million to be recognized over the course of the supply agreement.\nSegments\nIn the third quarter of 2015, there was a strategic shift in the business as a result of the Teva Transaction. As a result, the Company realigned its continuing operations into the following segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International Brands and Anda Distribution. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as five distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International Brands, Global Generics, and Anda Distribution. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs and the results of corporate initiatives are being managed outside of the four segments. The new operating segments are organized as follows:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The US Brands segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the United States, including certain Botox\u00ae therapies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The US Medical Aesthetics segment includes sales and expenses relating to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including certain Botox\u00ae therapies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The International Brands segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside of the United States.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The Anda Distribution segment includes distribution of generic and branded pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties, as well as by the Company, primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians' offices. The Anda Distribution segment operating results exclude sales of products developed, acquired, or licensed by the US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics and International Brands segments. As the generics business is now reported within discontinued operations, the Anda Distribution segment includes revenues and expenses related to Company manufactured generics products sold through Anda.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level:\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives.

In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis\u00ae, Lumigan\u00ae/Ganfort\u00ae, Alphagan\u00ae/Combigan\u00ae, Botox\u00ae, fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products. In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key US brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic \u00ae, Canasa\u00ae, Carafate\u00ae, Fetzima \u00ae, Linzess \u00ae, Namenda\u00aeIR (which lost exclusivity in July 2015), Namenda XR\u00ae, Saphris\u00ae, Teflaro\u00ae and Viibryd\u00ae. In October 2013, as a result of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, we began promoting a number of brand products, including, but not limited to, Actonel\u00ae, Asacol\u00ae HD, Atelvia\u00ae, Delzicol\u00ae, Estrace\u00ae Cream, Enablex\u00ae, Lo Loestrin\u00ae Fe and Minastrin\u00ae 24 Fe.\nCost of sales within segment contribution includes production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements, inventory reserve charges and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.\nSelling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.\nYEAR ENDED

contribution from the Forest Acquisition versus six months in the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in Women's Health is due to growth in oral contraceptives and Estrace\u00ae Cream.\nThe increase in operating expenses is due to the Allergan Acquisition and a full year of contribution from the Forest Acquisition versus six months in the year ended December 31, 2014, offset, in part by savings due to corporate initiatives due to the restructurings after the acquisitions of Legacy Allergan, Forest and Warner Chilcott during 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs part of the integration of Legacy Allergan with the Company, management transitioned the legacy Actavis Brand and Corporate U.S. and Canadian operations into the Legacy Allergan SAP Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP\u201d) system during January 2016. In preparation of this change, the Company shipped safety-stock inventory into the trade that approximated $275.0 million of gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on the terms and conditions associated with the safety stock, the amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in the quarter ending March 31, 2016.\nUS Medical Aesthetics\nThe following table presents net contribution for the US Medical Aesthetics segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facial Aesthetics Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 817.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 817.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical Dermatology Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 493.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 493.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plastic Surgery Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,513.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,513.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 302.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 302.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment contribution\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,078.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,078.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n.a.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe US Medical Aesthetics segment is primarily attributable to the Allergan Acquisition.

The significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Revenue Recognition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Inventory Valuation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Product Rights and other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Allocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Defined Benefit Plans\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Contingent Consideration and Other Commitments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and requires management's best estimates of the underlying data in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available GAAP alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the seller's price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, billback adjustments, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee-for-service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as SRA\u201d allowances.\nRoyalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured.\nProvisions for SRAs\nAs is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount depending on whether we have the right of offset with the customer. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary in prior periods to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated.\nChargebacks - A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler's customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly\nthrough a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Company's chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.\nRebates - Rebates include volume-related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Company's products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers' purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers' contracted rebate programs and the Company's historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.\nCash Discounts - Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings and historical customer payment experience. The Company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount.\nReturns and Other Allowances - The Company's provision for returns and other allowances include returns, pricing adjustments, promotional allowances, loyalty cards and billback adjustments.\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Company's policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returned products are generally not resalable. The Company's estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes that may impact future expected returns.\nPricing adjustments, which includes shelf stock adjustments, (and which primarily relate to our held for sale generics business) are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Company's direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments is based upon specific terms with the Company's customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns. We regularly monitor all price changes to evaluate the Company's reserve balances. The adequacy of these reserves is readily determinable as pricing adjustments and shelf stock adjustments are negotiated and settled on a customer-by-customer basis.\nPromotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms.\nBillback adjustments (and which primarily relate to our held for sale generics business), are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there is a difference between the customer's direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks is estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.\nLoyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and are accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.\nThe following table summarizes the activity from continuing operations in the Company's major categories of SRA ($ in millions):\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

distribution. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's increased sales of acquired eye care products and acquired Forest products lowered the provision percentage.\nThe Company does not expect future payments of SRA reserves to materially exceed our current estimates. However, if future SRA payments were to materially exceed our estimates, such adjustments may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work in process. Inventory includes brand pharmaceutical products which represents FDA approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the amount of such reserves may require judgment. Assumptions utilized in our quantification of inventory reserves include, but are not limited to, estimates of future product demand, consideration of current and future market conditions, product net selling price, anticipated product launch dates, potential product obsolescence and other events relating to special circumstances surrounding certain products. No material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales.\nProduct Rights and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, if results are materially aligned, over their estimated useful lives. We determine amortization periods for product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows. Such factors include the product's position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangibles useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our net results to decline.\nProduct rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in net (loss) / income in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset. Our projections of discounted cash flows use a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model. Our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other definite-lived intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. Different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other definite-lived intangible assets which could trigger impairment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nGeneral\nThe Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when the Company has a change to reporting units. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units.\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material impact to net (loss) / income and (loss) / earnings per share.\nAcquired IPR&D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR&D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR&D projects include legal risk, market risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.\nUpon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products ( CMP\u201d) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life.\nAnnual Testing\nDuring 2015, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill. We also assessed IPR&D intangible assets and trade name intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. The Company utilized a discount rate for its reporting units of 10.0% and long-term growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 5.0% in its estimation of fair value. The factors used in evaluating goodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management. Changes in the key assumptions by management can change the results of testing. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill or trade name intangible assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a $197.6 million impairment related to IPR&D for select projects as the Company revised its sales forecast of certain assets as well as the timing of the launch of certain projects in connection with the Company's annual review. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made the decision to abandon a select IPR&D asset (acquired in connection with the Allergan Acquisition) based on review of research studies, resulting in an impairment of the full asset value of $300.0 million. In-process research and development impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily included an impairment charge of $165.5 million related to the abandonment of certain R&D projects, an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to acquired IPR&D due to the FDA communications relating to Actavis' NDA for the fixed-dose combination of nebivolol and valsartan for the treatment of hypertension and the abandonment of a select dermatology project of $32.0 million.\nDuring the 2013 integration of the Actavis Group with the legacy Watson business, the Company reorganized its organizational structure and management performance reporting, which was then further reorganized. In 2013, the reporting units within our then current Actavis Pharma operating segment were organized as follows: Americas (The United States of America ( U.S.\u201d), Canada and Latin America), Europe (Europe, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS\u201d), and Turkey), and MEAAP (Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia Pacific). These reporting units combined the Watson and Actavis Group businesses. The combination of the Watson and the Actavis Group business and net assets in the European reporting unit, combined with other market factors, led to the impairment of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit in the second quarter of 2013 included as a component of discontinued operations.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, concurrent with the availability of discrete financial information for the then new reporting units, we completed an extensive review of our operating businesses included within discontinued operations, including exploring options for addressing overall profitability of seven Western European commercial operations consisting of, among other things, restructuring their operations, refocusing their activities on specific sub-markets, as well as potential divestitures of such businesses to other third parties. The potential impact of these conditions were considered in our projections when determining the indicated fair value of our reporting units for the impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter of 2013. Upon completion of step one of the impairment analysis for each of our reporting units, it was concluded that the fair value of the then current Actavis Pharma - Europe reporting unit was below its carrying value including goodwill. This was primarily related to the integration of our Arrow Group with the Actavis Group in Europe. The fair value of our reporting units was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model using management's business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows for approximately five years and residual growth rates ranging from 2% to 4% thereafter. Management believes that the assumptions it used for the impairment tests performed were consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant in performing similar valuations of our then current reporting units. A separate discount rate was utilized for each reporting unit that was derived from published sources and, on a weighted average basis, a discount rate of 8% was utilized using our weighted average cost of capital, which considered the overall inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect. As a result of completing step two of our impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment within discontinued operations of the Actavis Pharma - Europe reporting unit of $647.5 million, representing primarily all the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit, in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAllocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values as determined using a market participant concept. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe most material line items impacted by the allocation of acquisition fair values are:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Intangible assets (including IPR&D assets upon successful completion of the project and approval of the product) which are amortized to amortization expense over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams, the timing of approvals for IPR&D projects and the timing of related product launch dates, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, the impact of competitive trends on each asset's life cycle and other factors. These judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the future useful lives. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Fixed asset valuations which are depreciated over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates and intended uses of the assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Inventory is recorded at fair market value factoring in selling price and costs to dispose. Inventory acquired is typically valued higher than replacement cost.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that\nthreshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. The estimates of the obligation and related expense of these plans recorded in the financial statements are based on certain assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions used may include employee demographic factors such as compensation rate increases, retirement patterns, expected employee turnover and participant mortality rates. The difference between these assumptions and actual experience results in the recognition of an asset or liability based upon a net actuarial (gain) / loss. If the total net actuarial (gain) / loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) exceeds a threshold of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets, it is subject to amortization and recorded as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the pension plan. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nContingent Consideration and Other Commitments\nWe determine the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates, post-tax gross profit levels and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations including contingent payments such as milestone obligations, royalty obligations and contract earn-out criteria, where applicable. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined using the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation will be revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value will be reflected as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent payment obligations. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our contingent consideration fair value estimates could result in an increase in our contingent consideration obligation and a corresponding charge to operating results.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. We record reserves related to these legal matters when losses related to such litigation or contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable. Refer to NOTE 25 - Commitment and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this document for a description of our significant current legal proceedings.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), with an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was deferred by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on both historical and future financial positions and results of operations.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01 Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20).\u201d to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items. As a result, an entity will no longer (i) segregate an extraordinary item for the results of ordinary operations; (ii) separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; and (iii) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item. However, the ASU does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements for an event that is unusual in nature or that occurs infrequently. The guidance is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of\nadoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the classification of debt issuance costs from being an asset on the balance sheet to netting the costs against the carrying value of the debt. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The impact of the adoption of this guidance will decrease prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d and current portion of long-term debt and capital leases\u201d by $36.3 million as well as investments and other assets\u201d and long-term debt and capital leases\u201d by $159.5 million.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement: Topic 820 Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).\u201d The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12 Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pensions Plans (Topic 962) and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965).\u201d GAAP requires plans to disclose (i) individual investments that represent five percent or more of net assets available for benefits and (ii) the net appreciation or depreciation for investments by general type. Stakeholders said that while less costly to prepare, those disclosures do not provide decision-useful information. The amendments in this update will eliminate those requirements for both participant-directed investments and nonparticipant-directed investments. Plan investments need to be disaggregated only by general type within the statement of net assets available for benefits or within the footnotes and no longer required to provide the disclosures by investment class. The net appreciation or depreciation in investments for the period still will be required to be presented in the aggregate, but will no longer be required to be disaggregated and disclosed by general type. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nOn September 25, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16), which changes the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that measurement period adjustments be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. This includes the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on current and prior periods. The cumulative adjustment would be reflected within the respective financial statement line items affected. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB ASU No. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 704): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\u201d The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The Company has elected to adopt this guidance in the year ended December 31, 2015 and prior balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted. The total current deferred tax assets of $500.3 million included in current deferred tax assets and assets held for sale and current deferred tax liabilities of $47.3 million included in deferred tax liabilities and current liabilities held for sale were not reclassified in 2014.\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d under ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d in this document. In addition, the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nIn prior periods, our consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Actavis, Inc., and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. On May 16, 2013, Actavis plc (formally known as Actavis Limited) was incorporated in Ireland as a private limited company and re-registered effective September 20, 2013 as a public limited company. It was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott. On October 1, 2013, Actavis plc became the successor registrant of Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott in connection with the consummation of certain transactions further described elsewhere in this document. In addition, on October 1, 2013, the shares of Actavis plc began trading on the NYSE under the symbol ACT,\u201d the same symbol under which Actavis, Inc.'s shares previously traded. On March 17, 2015, Actavis, plc completed the acquisition of Allergan, Inc. On June 15, 2015, Actavis plc changed its name to Allergan plc and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol AGN\u201d. References throughout to ordinary shares\u201d refer to Actavis, Inc.'s Class A common shares, par value $0.0033 per share, prior to the consummation of the Transactions and to our ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, since the consummation of the Transactions. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan. Due to the deminimis activity between Allergan and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this section relate to both Allergan and Warner Chilcott.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOverview\nAllergan plc is a global specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of brand name, medical aesthetics, generic, branded generic, biosimilar and over-the-counter OTC pharmaceutical products. The Company has operations in more than 100 countries. Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc and has the same principal business activities. As a result of the Allergan Acquisition which closed on March 17, 2015, the Company expanded its franchises to include ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery, which complements the Company's existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women's health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits from Legacy Allergan's global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox\u00ae and Restasis\u00ae. The Allergan Acquisition also expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.\nWe have supported our business with a significant commitment to R&D expenditures. Our global growth strategy is focused on: (i) internal development of differentiated high-demand products; (ii) establishment of strategic alliances and collaborations that bring new products, technologies and markets to our existing portfolio; and (iii) acquisition of products and/or companies that complement our existing portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we marketed close to 100 branded pharmaceutical product families in the U.S. and a significant number of product families internationally. Branded pharmaceutical products are marketed under brand names through programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Through our Anda Distribution segment, we distribute approximately 13,200 SKUs in the U.S. primarily to independent pharmacies, alternate care providers (hospitals, nursing homes and mail order pharmacies) and pharmacy chains.\nOn July 26, 2015, Allergan plc entered into the Teva Agreement, under which Teva agreed to acquire the Company's global generic pharmaceuticals business and certain other assets. Under the Teva Agreement, upon the closing of the Teva Transaction, we will receive $33.75 billion in cash and 100.3 million Teva ordinary shares (or American Depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximates $6.75 billion in Teva stock using the then-current stock price at the time the Teva Transaction was announced, in exchange for which Teva will acquire our global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R&D unit, our international over-the-counter (OTC) commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands. We continue to work toward satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016; however, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter.\nOn November 23, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into the Pfizer Agreement under which Pfizer, a global innovative biopharmaceutical company, and Allergan plc will merge in the Pfizer Transaction, which attributes a $160.0 billion enterprise valuation using the then-current stock price at the time the Pfizer Transaction was announced. Company shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company ordinary shares for each of their existing Allergan shares and Pfizer stockholders will receive in respect of each share of Pfizer common stock held by them, at their election and subject to certain proration procedures described in the Pfizer Agreement, either one share of the combined company or an amount in cash equal to the volume weighted average price per share of Pfizer common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the consummation of the Pfizer Transaction. The Pfizer Transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2016.\n2015 Significant Business Developments\nThe following are the material transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAcquisitions\nAqueSys\nOn October 16, 2015, the Company completed the AqueSys Acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired XEN45, a soft shunt that is implanted in the sub conjunctival space in the eye through a minimally invasive procedure with a single use, pre-loaded proprietary injector. The AqueSys Acquisition had deminimis impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNorthwood Medical Innovation\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company acquired earFold\u2122 which is a medical device for the correction of prominent ears, with or without asymmetry, in patients aged 7 years and older. The Northwood Acquisition had deminimis impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nKythera\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company completed the Kythera Acquisition. Kythera was focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel prescription aesthetic products. Kythera's lead product, Kybella\u00ae injection, is the first and only FDA approved, non-surgical treatment for moderate to severe submental fullness, commonly referred to as double chin. The Company included the results of Kythera in its Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning October 1, 2015, including $77.2 million in stock compensation expense.\nOculeve\nOn August 10, 2015, the Company completed the Oculeve Acquisition. The Company acquired Oculeve and its lead product candidate OD-01, an intranasal neurostimulation device, as well as other dry eye products in development. The Oculeve Acquisition had deminimis impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAuden Mckenzie\nOn May 29, 2015, the Company completed the Auden Acquisition. The assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the results of operations for the acquired Auden business are part of the assets being divested in the Teva Transaction and are included as a component of income from discontinued operations. In addition, the acquired financial position is included in assets and liabilities held for sale.\nAllergan\nOn March 17, 2015, the Company completed the Allergan Acquisition. The addition of Legacy Allergan's therapeutic franchises in ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery complements the Company's existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women's health and urology franchises. The combined company benefited from Legacy Allergan's global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox\u00ae and Restasis\u00ae. The transaction also expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.\nThe contribution from the acquisition of Legacy Allergan for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows ($ in

The approval triggered the first CVR payment. The difference between the fair value of the CVR on the date of acquisition of $24.5 million and the payment made of $30.9 million, or $6.4 million, was recorded as an operating expense in the year ended December 31, 2015. In January 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for an expanded label which will include a single dose of Dalvance\u00ae, which triggers a second CVR payment in the year ending December 31, 2016.\nFuriex\nOn July 2, 2014, the Company completed the Furiex Acquisition.

intangibles including product rights. \nMedicines360\nOn June 10, 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Medicines360 to market, sell and distribute Medicines360 LNG20 in the U.S. and in Canada for a payment of approximately $52.3 million. According to the terms of the agreement, we are also required to pay Medicines360 certain regulatory and sales based milestone payments totaling up to nearly $125.0 million plus royalties. Medicines360 retained the rights to market the product in the U.S. public sector, including family planning clinics that provide services to low-income women. LNG20 is currently marketed as Liletta\u00ae and was originally developed by Uteron Pharma Operations SPRL in Belgium (now a subsidiary of the Company). We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nAcquisition of Uteron Pharma, S.A.\nOn January 23, 2013, the Company completed the Uteron Acquisition. The acquisition expanded the Company's specialty brand pipeline of women's health products including two potential near term commercial opportunities in contraception and infertility, and one oral contraceptive project projected to launch by 2018 at the time of the acquisition. Several additional products that were then in earlier stages of development were also acquired in the Uteron Acquisition. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nAt June 30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Estelle, a novel natural estrogen-based 28 day cycle oral contraceptive for the prevention of pregnancy, of $13.1 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently, the $22.8 million contingent liability related to Estelle was written off, resulting in a net gain of $9.7 million. At June 30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Colvir, a treatment of premalignant Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) lesions of the uterine, of $2.0 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently the $1.5 million contingent liability was also written off, resulting in a net loss of $0.5 million.\nDivestitures\nWestern European Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we held for sale our then current generic commercial infrastructure in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, including products, marketing authorizations and dossier license rights. On January 17, 2014, we announced our intention to enter into an agreement with Aurobindo to sell these businesses. On April 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of the assets in Western Europe.\nIn connection with the sale of our Western European assets, we entered into a supply agreement whereby the Company will supply product to Aurobindo over a period of five years. In the second quarter of 2014, we allocated the fair value of the consideration for the sale of the Western European assets of $65.0 million to each element of the agreement, including the supply of product.\nAs a result of the transactions, we recognized as a component of discontinued operations, income / (loss) on the net assets held for sale of $3.4 million and $(34.3) million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a loss on the disposal of the assets within discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2014 of $20.9 million and deferred revenue of $10.1 million to be recognized over the course of the supply agreement.\nSegments\nIn the third quarter of 2015, there was a strategic shift in the business as a result of the Teva Transaction. As a result, the Company realigned its continuing operations into the following segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International Brands and Anda Distribution. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as five distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International Brands, Global Generics, and Anda Distribution. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs and the results of corporate initiatives are being managed outside of the four segments. The new operating segments are organized as follows:\n \u00b7 The US Brands segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the United States, including certain Botox\u00ae therapies. \n \u00b7 The US Medical Aesthetics segment includes sales and expenses relating to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including certain Botox\u00ae therapies. \n \u00b7 The International Brands segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside of the United States. \n \u00b7 The Anda Distribution segment includes distribution of generic and branded pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties, as well as by the Company, primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians' offices. The Anda Distribution segment operating results exclude sales of products developed, acquired, or licensed by the US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics and International Brands segments. As the generics business is now reported within discontinued operations, the Anda Distribution segment includes revenues and expenses related to Company manufactured generics products sold through Anda. \nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level:\n \u00b7 Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs. \n \u00b7 General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including expenses located within the United States. \n \u00b7 Total assets including capital expenditures. \n \u00b7 Other select revenues and operating expenses including R&D expenses, amortization, IPR&D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments. \nThe Company defines segment net sales as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis\u00ae, Lumigan\u00ae/Ganfort\u00ae, Alphagan\u00ae/Combigan\u00ae, Botox\u00ae, fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products. In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key US brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic \u00ae, Canasa\u00ae, Carafate\u00ae, Fetzima \u00ae, Linzess \u00ae, Namenda\u00aeIR (which lost exclusivity in July 2015), Namenda XR\u00ae, Saphris\u00ae, Teflaro\u00ae and Viibryd\u00ae. In October 2013, as a result of the Warner Chilcott Acquisition, we began promoting a number of brand products, including, but not limited to, Actonel\u00ae, Asacol\u00ae HD, Atelvia\u00ae, Delzicol\u00ae, Estrace\u00ae Cream, Enablex\u00ae, Lo Loestrin\u00ae Fe and Minastrin\u00ae 24 Fe.\nCost of sales within segment contribution includes production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements, inventory reserve charges and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.\nSelling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.\nYEAR ENDED

These expenses included amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition and incremental costs associated with the acquisition related financing. \n (2) The impact of earnings subject to tax rates different than the statutory rate is primarily driven by the inclusion of Allergan post-acquisition operating income earned outside of the U.S. and Ireland. In addition, 2015 includes a full year of operating income from Forest compared to six months in 2014. The impact of this additional income is partially offset by an increase in amortization expense in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the statutory rate. \n (3) In 2015, the Company recorded $5.5 billion of amortization expense. A significant portion of this amount was incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the statutory rate resulting in a $246.2 million favorable impact on the effective tax rate. \n (4) Non-deductible expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily resulted from one-time non-deductible pre-tax expenses for the 2016 Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $153.7 million, Naurex Transaction related upfront consideration of $571.7 million recognized as a component of R&D expense, and other acquisition related transaction costs of $62.3 million. Non-deductible expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily resulted from one-time non-deductible pre-tax expenses for acquisition related costs of $98.8 million, penalties of $97.7 million and the 2015 Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $160.8 million, including the impact of an additional year of the fee of $105.1 million in accordance with final regulations issued in 2014 by the Internal Revenue Service. \n (5) Valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the release of a $296.2 million valuation allowance on certain capital loss carryforwards as a result of restructuring related to the global generics sale. \nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED TO 2013\nResults of operations, including segment net revenues, segment operating expenses and segment contribution consisted of the following ($ in millions):\n Year Ended December 31, 2014 US US Medical International Anda Brands Aesthetics Brands Distribution Total Net revenues $ 4,511.2 $ - $ 203.5 $ 2,024.2 $ 6,738.9 Operating expenses: Cost of sales(1) 736.7 - 48.2 1,711.6 2,496.5 Selling and marketing 806.4 - 48.2 135.6 990.2 General and administrative 119.5 - 12.0 36.4 167.9 Segment Contribution $ 2,848.6 $ - $ 95.1 $ 140.6 $ 3,084.3 Contribution margin 63.1 % 46.7 % 6.9 % 45.8 % Corporate 2,247.0 Research and development 605.7 Amortization 1,945.5 In-process research and development impairments 424.3 Asset sales and impairments, net 305.7 Operating (loss) (2,443.9 ) Operating margin (36.3 )% (1) Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights.

These losses included amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as part of the Forest Acquisition. \n (2) As a result of the Forest Acquisition in 2014 and the Warner Acquisition in 2013, the company incurred one-time tax charges of $36.8 million and $30.1 million, respectively. \n (3) Non-deductible expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily resulted from one-time non-deductible pre-tax expenses for acquisition related costs of $98.8 million, penalties of $97.7 million and the 2015 Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $160.8 million, including the impact of an additional year of the fee of $105.1 million in accordance with final regulations issued in 2014 by the Internal Revenue Service. \nDiscontinued Operations\nOn July 27, 2015, the Company announced that it has entered into the Teva Transaction.

The increase in operating income is the result of continued cost savings initiatives as well as the cessation of depreciation and amortization for assets being divested to Teva once they met the definition of held for sale on July 27, 2015. Offsetting these amounts, is an increase in divestiture related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 of $97.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $5,738.8 million related to investments in certain U.S. subsidiaries as this tax benefit will reverse in the foreseeable future. The recognition of this benefit has been reflected in income from discontinued operations, net of tax with the deferred tax asset reflected in non-current deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWorking Capital Position\nWorking capital at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is summarized as follows:\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,096.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 846.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,401.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,112.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,289.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,009.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 984.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 558.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 478.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,540.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,806.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (266.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred tax assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 477.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (477.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,615.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,504.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,349.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,030.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,319.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion of long-term debt and capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,432.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 693.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,739.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,491.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,449.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred tax liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,328.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,247.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,080.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working Capital\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 287.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,863.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,576.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working Capital excluding assets held for sale, net\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,761.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (494.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,266.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Current Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking capital excluding assets held for sale, net, decreased $1,266.7 million to ($1,761.4) million at December 31, 2015 compared to $(494.7) million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to additional debt financings to fund the Allergan Acquisition and cash used in acquisitions, as well as the adoption of ASU 2015-16 (defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2015, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as long-term, offset, in part, by the working capital acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition of $1,154.2 million, excluding cash.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows from operations are summarized as follows:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,530.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,243.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operations represent net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

The outstanding principal amount of loans under the AGN Five Year Tranche is payable in equal quarterly amounts of 2.50% per quarter prior to March 17, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on March 17, 2020.\nThe obligations of Actavis Capital under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis, Inc. and Actavis Funding SCS and will be guaranteed by any subsidiary of Allergan plc (other than Actavis Capital or a direct subsidiary of Allergan plc) that becomes a guarantor of third party indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $350.0 million (unless, in the case of a foreign subsidiary, such guarantee would give rise to adverse tax consequences as reasonably determined by Allergan plc).\nThe Company is subject to, and at December 31, 2015 was in compliance with, all financial and operational covenants under the terms of the AGN Term Loan.\nBridge Loan Facility\nOn December 17, 2014, Allergan and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a 364-day senior unsecured bridge credit agreement (the Bridge Loan Facility\u201d), among Actavis Capital, as borrower, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis, Inc., Actavis Funding SCS, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMCB, as administrative agent and the other financial institutions party thereto. No amounts were borrowed under the Bridge Loan Facility and the commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility expired on March 17, 2015 upon the closing of the Allergan Acquisition.\nCash Bridge Loan Facility\nOn March 11, 2015, Allergan and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a 60-day senior unsecured bridge credit agreement (the Cash Bridge Loan Facility\u201d), among Actavis Capital, as borrower, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis, Inc., Actavis Funding SCS, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Cash Bridge Lenders\u201d), JPMCB, as administrative agent and the other financial institutions party thereto. Under the Cash Bridge Loan Facility, the Cash Bridge Lenders committed to provide, subject to certain conditions, unsecured bridge financing, of which $2.8 billion was drawn to finance the Allergan Acquisition on March 17, 2015. The outstanding balance of the Cash Bridge Loan Facility was repaid on April 9, 2015.\nBorrowings under the Cash Bridge Loan Facility bore interest at our choice of a per annum rate equal to either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin per annum varying from 0.00% per annum to 1.00% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating or (b) a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin varying from 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn December 17, 2014, Allergan plc and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit loan and guaranty agreement (the Revolver Agreement\u201d) among Actavis Capital, as borrower, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis, Inc., Actavis Funding SCS, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Revolving Lenders\u201d), JPMCB as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto. Under the Revolver Agreement, the Revolving Lenders have committed to provide an unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion. The Revolver Agreement replaces Allergan plc's existing $750.0 million second amended and restated Actavis revolving credit and guaranty agreement dated as of June 30, 2014 (the Existing Revolver\u201d) among Actavis Capital, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis, Inc., Actavis Funding SCS, BofA, as administrative agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto. At closing, $600.0 million of loans were borrowed under the Revolver Agreement.\nThe Revolver Agreement provides that loans thereunder will bear interest, at Actavis Capital's choice, of a per annum rate equal to either (a) a base rate, plus an applicable margin per annum varying from 0.00% per annum to 1.00% per annum depending on the Debt Rating or (b) a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin varying from 0.875% per annum to 2.00% per annum depending on the Debt Rating. Additionally, to maintain availability of funds, the Company pays an unused commitment fee, which according to the pricing grid is set at 0.075% to 0.250% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating, of the unused portion of the revolver. The Revolving Credit Agreement will mature on December 17, 2019.\nThe obligations of Actavis Capital under the Revolver Agreement are guaranteed by Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis, Inc. and Actavis Funding SCS and will be guaranteed by any subsidiary of Allergan (other than Actavis Capital) that becomes a guarantor of third party indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $350 million (unless, in the case of a foreign subsidiary, such guarantee would give rise to adverse tax consequences as reasonably determined by Allergan plc).\nThe Company is subject to, and as of December 31, 2015 was in compliance with, all financial and operational covenants under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company borrowed $800.0 million under the revolving credit facility to fund, in part, the Kythera Acquisition. At December 31, 2015, $200.0 million was outstanding and was paid in full in January 2016. As of December 31, 2015, letters of credit outstanding were $28.8 million. The net availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $771.2 million.\nLong-term Obligations\nThe following table lists our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2015. Some of the amounts included herein are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligation we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table:\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period (Including Interest on Debt)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,603.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,375.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,094.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,418.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,714.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash interest(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,593.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,331.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,409.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,902.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,950.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent consideration liabilities(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 901.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 376.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 241.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D milestone obligations(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,664.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 444.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 752.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 478.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,990.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other obligations and commitments(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 870.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 223.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 577.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,829.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,515.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,262.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,107.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,943.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts represent total minimum cash payments and anticipated interest payments, as applicable, assuming scheduled repayments under the Company's existing notes. Amounts exclude fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums on outstanding debt obligations. \n (2) Amount primarily represents contingent consideration obligations, including accretion resulting from various acquisitions. \n (3) Amount represents operating leases for our global business. There are no contingent rental amounts or sublease rentals. \n (4) Amount represents capital leases for our global business, including interest. Leases are for property, plant and equipment, vehicles and furniture and fixtures. \n (5) We have future potential milestone payments and co-development expenses payable to third parties as part of our licensing, development and co-development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and are payable upon the satisfaction or achievement of certain developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones or as development expenses are incurred on defined projects. Amounts represent contractual payment obligations due as actual expenditures are incurred by our partners or upon the achievement of developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones based on anticipated approval dates assuming all milestone approval events are met. \nOther significant R&D milestone payments include the following maximum payments:\n \u00b7 Amounts owed under the Merck Transaction of $535.0 million; \n \u00b7 Amounts owed under the Naurex Transaction of $750.0 million; \n \u00b7 Amounts related to acquired contracts in the Allergan Acquisition of $1,066.9 million, including amounts related to Molecular Partners of $340.0 million, Vicept Therapeutics Inc. of $150.0 million and amounts owed to LiRIS Biomedical, Inc. of $286.0 million \n \u00b7 Amounts owed to Amgen, Inc. of up to $209.4 million; \n \u00b7 Amounts owed to PregLem to develop and, if approved, market products under development in the United States and Canada, of $74.0 million relating to Esmya in the United States and Fibristal in Canada; and \n \u00b7 Amounts owed to Medicines360 relating to LNG 20 in the United States and Canada of $47.5 million. \nWe also have potential sales-based milestones based on certain licensing agreements, which are not included in the table above as they are subject to the achievement of future results that are not reasonably estimable.\nMilestone payment obligations are uncertain, including the prediction of timing and the occurrence of events triggering a future obligation, and are not reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts in the table above do not include royalty obligations on future sales of product as the timing and amount of future sales levels and costs to produce products subject to milestone obligations is not reasonably estimable.\n (6) Other obligations and commitments include agreements to purchase third-party manufactured products, capital purchase obligations for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment and the liability for income tax associated with uncertain tax positions. \n (7) Total does not include contractual obligations already included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (except for capital leases, contingent consideration and the current portion of long-term debt) or certain purchase obligations, which are discussed below. \nFor purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are included only for purchase orders that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the timing of the obligation. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our suppliers within a relatively short period. At December 31, 2015, we have open purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements that are not included in the table above.\nWe are involved in certain equity investments that are intended to complement our core business and markets. We have the discretion to provide funding on occasion for working capital or capital expenditures. We make an evaluation of additional funding based on an assessment of the venture's business opportunities. We believe that any possible commitments arising from the current arrangements will not be significant to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n \u00b7 Revenue Recognition \n \u00b7 Inventory Valuation \n \u00b7 Product Rights and other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets \n \u00b7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives \n \u00b7 Allocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed \n \u00b7 Income Taxes \n \u00b7 Defined Benefit Plans \n \u00b7 Contingent Consideration and Other Commitments \nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and requires management's best estimates of the underlying data in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available GAAP alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the seller's price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, billback adjustments, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee-for-service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as SRA\u201d allowances.\nRoyalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured.\nProvisions for SRAs\nAs is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount depending on whether we have the right of offset with the customer. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary in prior periods to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated.\nChargebacks - A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler's customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly\nthrough a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Company's chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.\nRebates - Rebates include volume-related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Company's products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers' purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers' contracted rebate programs and the Company's historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.\nCash Discounts - Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings and historical customer payment experience. The Company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount.\nReturns and Other Allowances - The Company's provision for returns and other allowances include returns, pricing adjustments, promotional allowances, loyalty cards and billback adjustments.\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Company's policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returned products are generally not resalable. The Company's estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes that may impact future expected returns.\nPricing adjustments, which includes shelf stock adjustments, (and which primarily relate to our held for sale generics business) are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Company's direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments is based upon specific terms with the Company's customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns. We regularly monitor all price changes to evaluate the Company's reserve balances. The adequacy of these reserves is readily determinable as pricing adjustments and shelf stock adjustments are negotiated and settled on a customer-by-customer basis.\nPromotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms.\nBillback adjustments (and which primarily relate to our held for sale generics business), are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there is a difference between the customer's direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks is estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.\nLoyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and are accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.\nThe following table summarizes the activity from continuing operations in the Company's major categories of SRA ($ in millions):\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

distribution. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's increased sales of acquired eye care products and acquired Forest products lowered the provision percentage.\nThe Company does not expect future payments of SRA reserves to materially exceed our current estimates. However, if future SRA payments were to materially exceed our estimates, such adjustments may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work in process. Inventory includes brand pharmaceutical products which represents FDA approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the amount of such reserves may require judgment. Assumptions utilized in our quantification of inventory reserves include, but are not limited to, estimates of future product demand, consideration of current and future market conditions, product net selling price, anticipated product launch dates, potential product obsolescence and other events relating to special circumstances surrounding certain products. No material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales.\nProduct Rights and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, if results are materially aligned, over their estimated useful lives. We determine amortization periods for product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows. Such factors include the product's position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangibles useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our net results to decline.\nProduct rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in net (loss) / income in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset. Our projections of discounted cash flows use a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model. Our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other definite-lived intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. Different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other definite-lived intangible assets which could trigger impairment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nGeneral\nThe Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when the Company has a change to reporting units. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units.\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material impact to net (loss) / income and (loss) / earnings per share.\nAcquired IPR&D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR&D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR&D projects include legal risk, market risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.\nUpon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products ( CMP\u201d) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life.\nAnnual Testing\nDuring 2015, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill. We also assessed IPR&D intangible assets and trade name intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. The Company utilized a discount rate for its reporting units of 10.0% and long-term growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 5.0% in its estimation of fair value. The factors used in evaluating goodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management. Changes in the key assumptions by management can change the results of testing. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill or trade name intangible assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a $197.6 million impairment related to IPR&D for select projects as the Company revised its sales forecast of certain assets as well as the timing of the launch of certain projects in connection with the Company's annual review. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made the decision to abandon a select IPR&D asset (acquired in connection with the Allergan Acquisition) based on review of research studies, resulting in an impairment of the full asset value of $300.0 million. In-process research and development impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily included an impairment charge of $165.5 million related to the abandonment of certain R&D projects, an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to acquired IPR&D due to the FDA communications relating to Actavis' NDA for the fixed-dose combination of nebivolol and valsartan for the treatment of hypertension and the abandonment of a select dermatology project of $32.0 million.\nDuring the 2013 integration of the Actavis Group with the legacy Watson business, the Company reorganized its organizational structure and management performance reporting, which was then further reorganized. In 2013, the reporting units within our then current Actavis Pharma operating segment were organized as follows: Americas (The United States of America ( U.S.\u201d), Canada and Latin America), Europe (Europe, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS\u201d), and Turkey), and MEAAP (Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia Pacific). These reporting units combined the Watson and Actavis Group businesses. The combination of the Watson and the Actavis Group business and net assets in the European reporting unit, combined with other market factors, led to the impairment of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit in the second quarter of 2013 included as a component of discontinued operations.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, concurrent with the availability of discrete financial information for the then new reporting units, we completed an extensive review of our operating businesses included within discontinued operations, including exploring options for addressing overall profitability of seven Western European commercial operations consisting of, among other things, restructuring their operations, refocusing their activities on specific sub-markets, as well as potential divestitures of such businesses to other third parties. The potential impact of these conditions were considered in our projections when determining the indicated fair value of our reporting units for the impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter of 2013. Upon completion of step one of the impairment analysis for each of our reporting units, it was concluded that the fair value of the then current Actavis Pharma - Europe reporting unit was below its carrying value including goodwill. This was primarily related to the integration of our Arrow Group with the Actavis Group in Europe. The fair value of our reporting units was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model using management's business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows for approximately five years and residual growth rates ranging from 2% to 4% thereafter. Management believes that the assumptions it used for the impairment tests performed were consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant in performing similar valuations of our then current reporting units. A separate discount rate was utilized for each reporting unit that was derived from published sources and, on a weighted average basis, a discount rate of 8% was utilized using our weighted average cost of capital, which considered the overall inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect. As a result of completing step two of our impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment within discontinued operations of the Actavis Pharma - Europe reporting unit of $647.5 million, representing primarily all the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit, in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAllocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values as determined using a market participant concept. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe most material line items impacted by the allocation of acquisition fair values are:\n \u00b7 Intangible assets (including IPR&D assets upon successful completion of the project and approval of the product) which are amortized to amortization expense over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams, the timing of approvals for IPR&D projects and the timing of related product launch dates, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, the impact of competitive trends on each asset's life cycle and other factors. These judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the future useful lives. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. \n \u00b7 Fixed asset valuations which are depreciated over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates and intended uses of the assets. \n \u00b7 Inventory is recorded at fair market value factoring in selling price and costs to dispose. Inventory acquired is typically valued higher than replacement cost. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that\nthreshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. The estimates of the obligation and related expense of these plans recorded in the financial statements are based on certain assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions used may include employee demographic factors such as compensation rate increases, retirement patterns, expected employee turnover and participant mortality rates. The difference between these assumptions and actual experience results in the recognition of an asset or liability based upon a net actuarial (gain) / loss. If the total net actuarial (gain) / loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) exceeds a threshold of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets, it is subject to amortization and recorded as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the pension plan. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nContingent Consideration and Other Commitments\nWe determine the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates, post-tax gross profit levels and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations including contingent payments such as milestone obligations, royalty obligations and contract earn-out criteria, where applicable. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined using the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation will be revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value will be reflected as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent payment obligations. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our contingent consideration fair value estimates could result in an increase in our contingent consideration obligation and a corresponding charge to operating results.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. We record reserves related to these legal matters when losses related to such litigation or contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable. Refer to NOTE 25 - Commitment and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this document for a description of our significant current legal proceedings.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), with an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was deferred by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on both historical and future financial positions and results of operations.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01 Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20).\u201d to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items. As a result, an entity will no longer (i) segregate an extraordinary item for the results of ordinary operations; (ii) separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; and (iii) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item. However, the ASU does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements for an event that is unusual in nature or that occurs infrequently. The guidance is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of\nadoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the classification of debt issuance costs from being an asset on the balance sheet to netting the costs against the carrying value of the debt. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The impact of the adoption of this guidance will decrease prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d and current portion of long-term debt and capital leases\u201d by $36.3 million as well as investments and other assets\u201d and long-term debt and capital leases\u201d by $159.5 million.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement: Topic 820 Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).\u201d The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12 Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pensions Plans (Topic 962) and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965).\u201d GAAP requires plans to disclose (i) individual investments that represent five percent or more of net assets available for benefits and (ii) the net appreciation or depreciation for investments by general type. Stakeholders said that while less costly to prepare, those disclosures do not provide decision-useful information. The amendments in this update will eliminate those requirements for both participant-directed investments and nonparticipant-directed investments. Plan investments need to be disaggregated only by general type within the statement of net assets available for benefits or within the footnotes and no longer required to provide the disclosures by investment class. The net appreciation or depreciation in investments for the period still will be required to be presented in the aggregate, but will no longer be required to be disaggregated and disclosed by general type. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nOn September 25, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16), which changes the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that measurement period adjustments be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined.

The Company has operations in more than 100 countries. Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc and has the same principal business activities. As a result of the Allergan Acquisition which closed on March 17, 2015, the Company expanded its franchises to include ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery, which complements the Company's existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women's health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits from Legacy Allergan's global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox\u00ae and Restasis\u00ae. The Allergan Acquisition also expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.\nWe have supported our business with a significant commitment to R&D expenditures. Our global growth strategy is focused on: (i) internal development of differentiated high-demand products; (ii) establishment of strategic alliances and collaborations that bring new products, technologies and markets to our existing portfolio; and (iii) acquisition of products and/or companies that complement our existing portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we marketed close to 100 branded pharmaceutical product families in the U.S. and a significant number of product families internationally. Branded pharmaceutical products are marketed under brand names through programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Through our Anda Distribution segment, we distribute approximately 13,200 SKUs in the U.S. primarily to independent pharmacies, alternate care providers (hospitals, nursing homes and mail order pharmacies) and pharmacy chains.\nOn July 26, 2015, Allergan plc entered into the Teva Agreement, under which Teva agreed to acquire the Company's global generic pharmaceuticals business and certain other assets. Under the Teva Agreement, upon the closing of the Teva Transaction, we will receive $33.75 billion in cash and 100.3 million Teva ordinary shares (or American Depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximates $6.75 billion in Teva stock using the then-current stock price at the time the Teva Transaction was announced, in exchange for which Teva will acquire our global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R&D unit, our international over-the-counter (OTC) commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands. We continue to work toward satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016; however, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter.\nOn November 23, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into the Pfizer Agreement under which Pfizer, a global innovative biopharmaceutical company, and Allergan plc will merge in the Pfizer Transaction, which attributes a $160.0 billion enterprise valuation using the then-current stock price at the time the Pfizer Transaction was announced. Company shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company ordinary shares for each of their existing Allergan shares and Pfizer stockholders will receive in respect of each share of Pfizer common stock held by them, at their election and subject to certain proration procedures described in the Pfizer Agreement, either one share of the combined company or an amount in cash equal to the volume weighted average price per share of Pfizer common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the consummation of the Pfizer Transaction.

This amount was paid as of December 31, 2015.\nForest Laboratories\nOn July 1, 2014, the Company completed the Forest Acquisition. Forest was a leading, fully integrated, specialty pharmaceutical company largely focused on the United States market.

The acquisition expanded the Company's specialty brand pipeline of women's health products including two potential near term commercial opportunities in contraception and infertility, and one oral contraceptive project projected to launch by 2018 at the time of the acquisition. Several additional products that were then in earlier stages of development were also acquired in the Uteron Acquisition. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination requiring that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nAt June 30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Estelle, a novel natural estrogen-based 28 day cycle oral contraceptive for the prevention of pregnancy, of $13.1 million was deemed to be fully impaired. Consequently, the $22.8 million contingent liability related to Estelle was written off, resulting in a net gain of $9.7 million. At June 30, 2014, after an identified triggering event, the acquired IPR&D intangible asset related to Colvir, a treatment of premalignant Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) lesions of the uterine, of $2.0 million was deemed to be fully impaired.

In addition, the Company recognized a loss on the disposal of the assets within discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2014 of $20.9 million and deferred revenue of $10.1 million to be recognized over the course of the supply agreement.\nSegments\nIn the third quarter of 2015, there was a strategic shift in the business as a result of the Teva Transaction. As a result, the Company realigned its continuing operations into the following segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International Brands and Anda Distribution. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as five distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International Brands, Global Generics, and Anda Distribution. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs and the results of corporate initiatives are being managed outside of the four segments. The new operating segments are organized as follows:\n \u00b7 The US Brands segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the United States, including certain Botox\u00ae therapies. \n \u00b7 The US Medical Aesthetics segment includes sales and expenses relating to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including certain Botox\u00ae therapies. \n \u00b7 The International Brands segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside of the United States. \n \u00b7 The Anda Distribution segment includes distribution of generic and branded pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties, as well as by the Company, primarily to independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, pharmacy buying groups and physicians' offices. The Anda Distribution segment operating results exclude sales of products developed, acquired, or licensed by the US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics and International Brands segments. As the generics business is now reported within discontinued operations, the Anda Distribution segment includes revenues and expenses related to Company manufactured generics products sold through Anda. \nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level:\n \u00b7 Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales (excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights), selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs. \n \u00b7 General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including expenses located within the United States. \n \u00b7 Total assets including capital expenditures. \n \u00b7 Other select revenues and operating expenses including R&D expenses, amortization, IPR&D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments. \nThe Company defines segment net sales as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis\u00ae, Lumigan\u00ae/Ganfort\u00ae, Alphagan\u00ae/Combigan\u00ae, Botox\u00ae, fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products. In July 2014, as a result of the Forest Acquisition, the Company also began recognizing revenues on key US brands, including, but not limited to, Bystolic \u00ae, Canasa\u00ae, Carafate\u00ae, Fetzima \u00ae, Linzess \u00ae, Namenda\u00aeIR (which lost exclusivity in July 2015), Namenda XR\u00ae, Saphris\u00ae, Teflaro\u00ae and Viibryd\u00ae.

Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.\nSelling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO 2014\nResults of operations, including segment net revenues, segment operating expenses and segment contribution consisted of the following ($ in millions):\n\n (1) Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights. \n\n (1) Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights. \nThe following is a reconciliation of net revenues for the operating segments to the Company's net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):\n\nNo country represents ten percent or more of net revenues outside of the United States.

The increase in Women's Health is due to growth in oral contraceptives and Estrace\u00ae Cream.\nThe increase in operating expenses is due to the Allergan Acquisition and a full year of contribution from the Forest Acquisition versus six months in the year ended December 31, 2014, offset, in part by savings due to corporate initiatives due to the restructurings after the acquisitions of Legacy Allergan, Forest and Warner Chilcott during 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs part of the integration of Legacy Allergan with the Company, management transitioned the legacy Actavis Brand and Corporate U.S. and Canadian operations into the Legacy Allergan SAP Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP\u201d) system during January 2016. In preparation of this change, the Company shipped safety-stock inventory into the trade that approximated $275.0 million of gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on the terms and conditions associated with the safety stock, the amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in the quarter ending March 31, 2016.\nUS Medical Aesthetics\nThe following table presents net contribution for the US Medical Aesthetics segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 ($ in millions):\n\n (1) Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights. \nThe US Medical Aesthetics segment is primarily attributable to the Allergan Acquisition.

Also included are results related to the Company's manufactured generic products sold through our Anda Distribution segment that were previously included in our former Global Generics Segment.\nCost of Sales\nThe increase in cost of sales within our Anda Distribution segment was due to higher product sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased to 85.6% compared to 84.6% in the prior year period primarily due to product and customer mix.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nThe increase in selling and marketing expenses relate to higher freight costs and higher personnel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative costs were due to higher personnel costs.\nCorporate\nCorporate represents the results of corporate initiatives as well as the impact of select revenues and shared costs.

The reconciliations between the statutory Irish income tax rates for Allergan plc and the effective income tax rates were as follows:\n\nThe material drivers of the period-over-period tax rate movements are as follows:\n (1) Earnings subject to U.S. federal and state tax had a larger impact on the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2015 compared to the period ended December 31, 2014 due to a significant increase in expenses in 2015. These expenses included amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition and incremental costs associated with the acquisition related financing. \n (2) The impact of earnings subject to tax rates different than the statutory rate is primarily driven by the inclusion of Allergan post-acquisition operating income earned outside of the U.S. and Ireland. In addition, 2015 includes a full year of operating income from Forest compared to six months in 2014. The impact of this additional income is partially offset by an increase in amortization expense in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the statutory rate. \n (3) In 2015, the Company recorded $5.5 billion of amortization expense. A significant portion of this amount was incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the statutory rate resulting in a $246.2 million favorable impact on the effective tax rate. \n (4) Non-deductible expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily resulted from one-time non-deductible pre-tax expenses for the 2016 Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $153.7 million, Naurex Transaction related upfront consideration of $571.7 million recognized as a component of R&D expense, and other acquisition related transaction costs of $62.3 million.

The increase in operating income is the result of continued cost savings initiatives as well as the cessation of depreciation and amortization for assets being divested to Teva once they met the definition of held for sale on July 27, 2015. Offsetting these amounts, is an increase in divestiture related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 of $97.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $5,738.8 million related to investments in certain U.S. subsidiaries as this tax benefit will reverse in the foreseeable future.

The decrease in working capital is primarily due to additional debt financings to fund the Allergan Acquisition and cash used in acquisitions, as well as the adoption of ASU 2015-16 (defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2015, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as long-term, offset, in part, by the working capital acquired as part of the Allergan Acquisition of $1,154.2 million, excluding cash.\nCash Flows from Operations\nOur cash flows from operations are summarized as follows:\n\nCash flows from operations represent net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company borrowed $800.0 million under the revolving credit facility to fund, in part, the Kythera Acquisition. At December 31, 2015, $200.0 million was outstanding and was paid in full in January 2016. As of December 31, 2015, letters of credit outstanding were $28.8 million. The net availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $771.2 million.\nLong-term Obligations\nThe following table lists our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2015. Some of the amounts included herein are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligation we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table:\n\n (1) Amounts represent total minimum cash payments and anticipated interest payments, as applicable, assuming scheduled repayments under the Company's existing notes. Amounts exclude fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums on outstanding debt obligations. \n (2) Amount primarily represents contingent consideration obligations, including accretion resulting from various acquisitions. \n (3) Amount represents operating leases for our global business. There are no contingent rental amounts or sublease rentals. \n (4) Amount represents capital leases for our global business, including interest. Leases are for property, plant and equipment, vehicles and furniture and fixtures. \n (5) We have future potential milestone payments and co-development expenses payable to third parties as part of our licensing, development and co-development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and are payable upon the satisfaction or achievement of certain developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones or as development expenses are incurred on defined projects. Amounts represent contractual payment obligations due as actual expenditures are incurred by our partners or upon the achievement of developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones based on anticipated approval dates assuming all milestone approval events are met. \nOther significant R&D milestone payments include the following maximum payments:\n \u00b7 Amounts owed under the Merck Transaction of $535.0 million; \n \u00b7 Amounts owed under the Naurex Transaction of $750.0 million; \n \u00b7 Amounts related to acquired contracts in the Allergan Acquisition of $1,066.9 million, including amounts related to Molecular Partners of $340.0 million, Vicept Therapeutics Inc. of $150.0 million and amounts owed to LiRIS Biomedical, Inc. of $286.0 million \n \u00b7 Amounts owed to Amgen, Inc. of up to $209.4 million; \n \u00b7 Amounts owed to PregLem to develop and, if approved, market products under development in the United States and Canada, of $74.0 million relating to Esmya in the United States and Fibristal in Canada; and \n \u00b7 Amounts owed to Medicines360 relating to LNG 20 in the United States and Canada of $47.5 million. \nWe also have potential sales-based milestones based on certain licensing agreements, which are not included in the table above as they are subject to the achievement of future results that are not reasonably estimable.\nMilestone payment obligations are uncertain, including the prediction of timing and the occurrence of events triggering a future obligation, and are not reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts in the table above do not include royalty obligations on future sales of product as the timing and amount of future sales levels and costs to produce products subject to milestone obligations is not reasonably estimable.\n (6) Other obligations and commitments include agreements to purchase third-party manufactured products, capital purchase obligations for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment and the liability for income tax associated with uncertain tax positions. \n (7) Total does not include contractual obligations already included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (except for capital leases, contingent consideration and the current portion of long-term debt) or certain purchase obligations, which are discussed below. \nFor purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are included only for purchase orders that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the timing of the obligation. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our suppliers within a relatively short period. At December 31, 2015, we have open purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements that are not included in the table above.\nWe are involved in certain equity investments that are intended to complement our core business and markets. We have the discretion to provide funding on occasion for working capital or capital expenditures. We make an evaluation of additional funding based on an assessment of the venture's business opportunities. We believe that any possible commitments arising from the current arrangements will not be significant to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n \u00b7 Revenue Recognition \n \u00b7 Inventory Valuation \n \u00b7 Product Rights and other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets \n \u00b7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives \n \u00b7 Allocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed \n \u00b7 Income Taxes \n \u00b7 Defined Benefit Plans \n \u00b7 Contingent Consideration and Other Commitments \nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and requires management's best estimates of the underlying data in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available GAAP alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the seller's price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, billback adjustments, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee-for-service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as SRA\u201d allowances.\nRoyalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured.\nProvisions for SRAs\nAs is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount depending on whether we have the right of offset with the customer. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary in prior periods to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company uses a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated.\nChargebacks - A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler's customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly\nthrough a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Company's chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.\nRebates - Rebates include volume-related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Company's products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers' purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers' contracted rebate programs and the Company's historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.\nCash Discounts - Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings and historical customer payment experience. The Company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount.\nReturns and Other Allowances - The Company's provision for returns and other allowances include returns, pricing adjustments, promotional allowances, loyalty cards and billback adjustments.\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Company's policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returned products are generally not resalable. The Company's estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes that may impact future expected returns.\nPricing adjustments, which includes shelf stock adjustments, (and which primarily relate to our held for sale generics business) are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Company's direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments is based upon specific terms with the Company's customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns. We regularly monitor all price changes to evaluate the Company's reserve balances. The adequacy of these reserves is readily determinable as pricing adjustments and shelf stock adjustments are negotiated and settled on a customer-by-customer basis.\nPromotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms.\nBillback adjustments (and which primarily relate to our held for sale generics business), are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there is a difference between the customer's direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks is estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.\nLoyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and are accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel.\nThe following table summarizes the activity from continuing operations in the Company's major categories of SRA ($ in millions):\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity from discontinued operations in the Company's major categories of SRA ($ in millions):\n\nThe following table summarizes the balance sheet classification of our SRA reserves ($ in millions):\n\nThe following table summarizes the balance sheet classification of our SRA reserves relating to the generics business being divested to Teva ($ in millions):\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company lowered SRA balances relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the Forest Acquisition measurement period adjustments by $53.2 million, with an offset to goodwill ($33.2 million) and deferred tax liabilities ($20.0 million).\nThe provisions recorded to reduce gross product sales to net product sales were as follows ($ in millions):\n\nThe movement in the percentage of provisions to gross sales is a result of changes in product mix, competition and channels of distribution. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's increased sales of acquired eye care products and acquired Forest products lowered the provision percentage.\nThe Company does not expect future payments of SRA reserves to materially exceed our current estimates. However, if future SRA payments were to materially exceed our estimates, such adjustments may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work in process. Inventory includes brand pharmaceutical products which represents FDA approved indications. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of factors/situations including, but not limited to, raw materials, work in process or finished goods not meeting product specifications, product obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value) concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the amount of such reserves may require judgment. Assumptions utilized in our quantification of inventory reserves include, but are not limited to, estimates of future product demand, consideration of current and future market conditions, product net selling price, anticipated product launch dates, potential product obsolescence and other events relating to special circumstances surrounding certain products. No material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales.\nProduct Rights and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, if results are materially aligned, over their estimated useful lives. We determine amortization periods for product rights and other definite-lived intangible assets based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows. Such factors include the product's position in its life cycle, the existence or absence of like products in the market, various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangibles useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our net results to decline.\nProduct rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in net (loss) / income in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset. Our projections of discounted cash flows use a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model. Our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other definite-lived intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. Different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other definite-lived intangible assets which could trigger impairment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nGeneral\nThe Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when the Company has a change to reporting units. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units.\nGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material impact to net (loss) / income and (loss) / earnings per share.\nAcquired IPR&D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR&D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR&D projects include legal risk, market risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.\nUpon successful completion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products ( CMP\u201d) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated useful life.\nAnnual Testing\nDuring 2015, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill. We also assessed IPR&D intangible assets and trade name intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. The Company utilized a discount rate for its reporting units of 10.0% and long-term growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 5.0% in its estimation of fair value. The factors used in evaluating goodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management. Changes in the key assumptions by management can change the results of testing. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill or trade name intangible assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a $197.6 million impairment related to IPR&D for select projects as the Company revised its sales forecast of certain assets as well as the timing of the launch of certain projects in connection with the Company's annual review. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made the decision to abandon a select IPR&D asset (acquired in connection with the Allergan Acquisition) based on review of research studies, resulting in an impairment of the full asset value of $300.0 million. In-process research and development impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily included an impairment charge of $165.5 million related to the abandonment of certain R&D projects, an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to acquired IPR&D due to the FDA communications relating to Actavis' NDA for the fixed-dose combination of nebivolol and valsartan for the treatment of hypertension and the abandonment of a select dermatology project of $32.0 million.\nDuring the 2013 integration of the Actavis Group with the legacy Watson business, the Company reorganized its organizational structure and management performance reporting, which was then further reorganized. In 2013, the reporting units within our then current Actavis Pharma operating segment were organized as follows: Americas (The United States of America ( U.S.\u201d), Canada and Latin America), Europe (Europe, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS\u201d), and Turkey), and MEAAP (Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia Pacific). These reporting units combined the Watson and Actavis Group businesses. The combination of the Watson and the Actavis Group business and net assets in the European reporting unit, combined with other market factors, led to the impairment of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit in the second quarter of 2013 included as a component of discontinued operations.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, concurrent with the availability of discrete financial information for the then new reporting units, we completed an extensive review of our operating businesses included within discontinued operations, including exploring options for addressing overall profitability of seven Western European commercial operations consisting of, among other things, restructuring their operations, refocusing their activities on specific sub-markets, as well as potential divestitures of such businesses to other third parties. The potential impact of these conditions were considered in our projections when determining the indicated fair value of our reporting units for the impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter of 2013. Upon completion of step one of the impairment analysis for each of our reporting units, it was concluded that the fair value of the then current Actavis Pharma - Europe reporting unit was below its carrying value including goodwill. This was primarily related to the integration of our Arrow Group with the Actavis Group in Europe. The fair value of our reporting units was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model using management's business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows for approximately five years and residual growth rates ranging from 2% to 4% thereafter. Management believes that the assumptions it used for the impairment tests performed were consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant in performing similar valuations of our then current reporting units. A separate discount rate was utilized for each reporting unit that was derived from published sources and, on a weighted average basis, a discount rate of 8% was utilized using our weighted average cost of capital, which considered the overall inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect. As a result of completing step two of our impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment within discontinued operations of the Actavis Pharma - Europe reporting unit of $647.5 million, representing primarily all the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit, in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAllocation of Acquisition Fair Values to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values as determined using a market participant concept. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe most material line items impacted by the allocation of acquisition fair values are:\n \u00b7 Intangible assets (including IPR&D assets upon successful completion of the project and approval of the product) which are amortized to amortization expense over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams, the timing of approvals for IPR&D projects and the timing of related product launch dates, the assessment of each asset's life cycle, the impact of competitive trends on each asset's life cycle and other factors. These judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the future useful lives. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. \n \u00b7 Fixed asset valuations which are depreciated over the expected life of the asset. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets. Fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on, among other factors, estimates of expected future net cash flows, estimates of appropriate discount rates and intended uses of the assets. \n \u00b7 Inventory is recorded at fair market value factoring in selling price and costs to dispose. Inventory acquired is typically valued higher than replacement cost. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that\nthreshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. The estimates of the obligation and related expense of these plans recorded in the financial statements are based on certain assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions used may include employee demographic factors such as compensation rate increases, retirement patterns, expected employee turnover and participant mortality rates. The difference between these assumptions and actual experience results in the recognition of an asset or liability based upon a net actuarial (gain) / loss. If the total net actuarial (gain) / loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) exceeds a threshold of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets, it is subject to amortization and recorded as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the pension plan. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nContingent Consideration and Other Commitments\nWe determine the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates, post-tax gross profit levels and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations including contingent payments such as milestone obligations, royalty obligations and contract earn-out criteria, where applicable. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined using the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820. The resultant probability-weighted cash flows are discounted using an appropriate effective annual interest rate. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation will be revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value will be reflected as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various contingent payment obligations. Adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our contingent consideration fair value estimates could result in an increase in our contingent consideration obligation and a corresponding charge to operating results.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. We record reserves related to these legal matters when losses related to such litigation or contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable. Refer to NOTE 25 - Commitment and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this document for a description of our significant current legal proceedings.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), with an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was deferred by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on both historical and future financial positions and results of operations.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01 Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20).\u201d to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items. As a result, an entity will no longer (i) segregate an extraordinary item for the results of ordinary operations; (ii) separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; and (iii) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item. However, the ASU does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements for an event that is unusual in nature or that occurs infrequently. The guidance is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of\nadoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the classification of debt issuance costs from being an asset on the balance sheet to netting the costs against the carrying value of the debt. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The impact of the adoption of this guidance will decrease prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d and current portion of long-term debt and capital leases\u201d by $36.3 million as well as investments and other assets\u201d and long-term debt and capital leases\u201d by $159.5 million.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement: Topic 820 Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).\u201d The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12 Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pensions Plans (Topic 962) and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965).\u201d GAAP requires plans to disclose (i) individual investments that represent five percent or more of net assets available for benefits and (ii) the net appreciation or depreciation for investments by general type. Stakeholders said that while less costly to prepare, those disclosures do not provide decision-useful information. The amendments in this update will eliminate those requirements for both participant-directed investments and nonparticipant-directed investments. Plan investments need to be disaggregated only by general type within the statement of net assets available for benefits or within the footnotes and no longer required to provide the disclosures by investment class. The net appreciation or depreciation in investments for the period still will be required to be presented in the aggregate, but will no longer be required to be disaggregated and disclosed by general type. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nOn September 25, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16), which changes the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that measurement period adjustments be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. This includes the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on current and prior periods. The cumulative adjustment would be reflected within the respective financial statement line items affected. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB ASU No. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 704): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\u201d The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The Company has elected to adopt this guidance in the year ended December 31, 2015 and prior balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted. The total current deferred tax assets of $500.3 million included in current deferred tax assets and assets held for sale and current deferred tax liabilities of $47.3 million included in deferred tax liabilities and current liabilities held for sale were not reclassified in 2014.\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended
