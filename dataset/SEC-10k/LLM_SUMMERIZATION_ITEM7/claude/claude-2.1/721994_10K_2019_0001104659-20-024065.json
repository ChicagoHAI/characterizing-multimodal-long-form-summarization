MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nNet income in 2019 was $87.0 million, up 8.3% from $80.4 million in 2018 and up 51.8% from $57.3 million in 2017. Diluted net income per common share was $3.38 in 2019, $3.13 in 2018 and $2.23 in 2017. Return on average total assets was 1.76% in 2019 versus 1.69% in 2018 and 1.29% in 2017. Return on average total equity was 15.47% in 2019 versus 16.51% in 2018 and 12.72% in 2017. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 34.32% in 2019, 31.95% in 2018 and 38.12% in 2017. The average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38% in 2019 compared to 10.24% in 2018 and 10.15% in 2017.\nNet income in 2019 was positively impacted by a $4.7 million increase in noninterest income, a $3.8 million increase in net interest income and a $3.2 million decrease in the provision for loan losses. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $3.2 million increase in noninterest expense.\nNet income in 2018 was positively impacted by a $15.4 million increase in net interest income and a $4.3 million increase in noninterest income. In addition, income tax expense decreased $13.8 million from 2017. The decrease was largely due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which lowered the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35%. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $6.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a $3.4 million increase in the provision for loan losses, respectively.\nTotal assets were $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019 versus $4.875 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $71.5 million or 1.5%. This increase was primarily due to a $148.9 million increase in total loans, and a $22.7 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $117.5 million. Total average assets increased $183.5 million primarily due to average loans increasing $130.6 million in 2019, and a $41.2 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCertain of the Company's accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation and other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans, although the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged against the allowance. A provision for loan losses is taken based on management's ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance. A formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted monthly. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company's control.\nThe level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio, emerging market risk, emerging concentration risk, commercial loan focus and large credit concentration, new industry lending activity, general economic conditions and historical loss analysis. In addition, management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Furthermore, management's overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision.\nThe determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates by management. The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors: changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay. Consideration is not limited to these factors although they represent the most commonly cited factors. With respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits, management considers the current valuation of collateral and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows as the primary measures. Management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits. With respect to pools of similar loans,\nallocations are assigned based upon historical experience subject to a floor, unless the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical losses as noted below. A detailed analysis is performed on loans that are classified but determined not to be impaired which incorporates different scenarios where the risk that the borrower will be unable or unwilling to repay its debt in full or on time is combined with an estimate of loss in the event the borrower cannot pay to develop non-specific allocations for such loan pools. These allocations may be adjusted based on the other factors cited above. An appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined by portfolio segment using historical loss percentages subject to a floor, supplemented with other environmental factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and impaired loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedure, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. It is also possible that the following could affect the overall process: social, political, economic and terrorist events or activities. All of these factors are susceptible to change, which may be significant. As a result of this detailed process, the allowance results in two forms of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nCommercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration function. These grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a consensus is reached by credit administration and the loan review officer. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that indicate the loan is impaired. Considerations with respect to specific allocations for these individual credits include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) does the customer's cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan; (b) is there adequate collateral to repay the loan; (c) has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination; (d) is the loan impaired; (e) are there other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question; or (f) are there unique loan characteristics that require special monitoring.\nAllocations are also applied to categories of loans considered not to be individually impaired, but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. In addition, general allocations are made for other pools of loans, including non-classified loans. These general pooled loan allocations are performed for portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and multi-family, agri-business and agricultural, other commercial, consumer 1-4 family mortgage and other consumer loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a three-year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios, subject to a floor, and are adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends.\nDue to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses, the Company's allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component. The unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the Company's judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations, including factors such as the level of classified credits, economic uncertainties, industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments, broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the Company's large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers.\nValuation and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Available-for-Sale Investment Securities\nThe fair values of securities available-for-sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models, which utilize significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing. This is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. The fair value of certain securities is determined using unobservable inputs, primarily observable inputs of similar securities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. Impairment is other-than-temporary if the decline in the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security will not be received.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining impairment, which includes making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining other-than-temporary impairment for a security or investment:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assessment of whether a decline exists that is other-than-temporary, involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. If, in management's judgment, other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down to the computed net present value, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings (as if the loss had been realized in the period of other-than-temporary impairment).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nIn 2019 and 2018, the Company continued to grow loans and deposits organically, in its geographic footprint of northern Indiana and in central Indiana in the Indianapolis market. The Company had 50 branches as of December 31, 2019. The Company's profitability has been positively impacted by growth in loans and deposits. In addition, asset quality has remained stable. The core banking contributions to noninterest income of mortgage banking, loan and wealth management fee income increased in 2019. Overall, expense growth has reflected our continued investment in people, technology and our branch infrastructure. The outlook for 2020 includes plans for continued organic loan and deposit growth, a disciplined credit philosophy, continued investment in the Company in the form of staff additions, continued expansion in our geographic footprint, continued investments in customer facing technology and cybersecurity risk management tools.\nSelected income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Statement Summary:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 155,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 151,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 135,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dilutive EPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible capital ratio (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.01)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income to total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Noninterest expense/Net interest income plus Noninterest income. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>(2) </td> <td>Tangible common equity, tangible assets, and the tangible capital ratio are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts.

In addition, average earning assets increased $195.3 million, or 4.4%, in 2019, driven by an increase of 3.8% in the average commercial loan portfolio, which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending. The net interest margin decreased to 3.38% in 2019 versus 3.43% in 2018, due to higher costs on average interest bearing liabilities, which offset an increase in the yield of earning assets during 2019. Net interest income increased by $15.4 million to $151.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a 46 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets to 4.50% from 4.04%. In addition, average earning assets increased $278.3 million, or 6.7% in 2018, driven by an increase of 6.2% in the average commercial loan portfolio, which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending. The net interest margin increased to 3.43% in 2018 versus 3.33% in 2017, due to higher yields on average earning assets, which more than offset an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities during 2018.\nGrowth in the commercial loan portfolio accounted for most of the growth in loans, as well as total earning assets, during both 2019 and 2018 and positively impacted total interest income. Management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio will likely continue in a measured and prudent fashion as a result of our continued strategic focus on commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. Loan growth was slower in 2019 and 2018 as compared to prior years due to a slowdown in manufacturing and industrial loans. In addition, the utilization of commercial lines of credit has dropped in 2019 and 2018 due to softened loan demand. Management believes its organic growth strategy of continued expansion in its current geographic footprint and in Indianapolis will provide continued loan growth opportunities. During 2019, growth in average loans of $130.6 million and growth in available-for-sale investment securities of $41.2 million was funded through an increase in deposits. Average demand deposits increased $86.1 million in 2019 and average interest bearing deposit accounts increased $62.5 million.\nThe increase in the Company's yields on average earning assets during 2019 and 2018 resulted from increases in market rates overall, including increases in loan portfolio yields during both years. In the third and fourth quarter of 2019, market rates were impacted by three Federal Reserve Bank decreases of 25 basis points each in the Federal Funds Rate, which occurred in July 2019, September 2019, and October 2019. However, the impact of these decreases was not felt until later in the second half of 2019. During 2019 management continued to focus on growing the commercial portfolio in a prudent and responsible manner. The cost of funds was also impacted by the decreases in the Federal Funds Rate during the second half of 2019. However, given the asset-sensitive nature of the Company's balance sheet, loan interest rates repriced quicker than deposit interest costs, resulting in margin compression in the second half of 2019.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nIn 2019 the Company recorded provision for loan loss expense of $3.2 million primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio. The 2019 provision expense compares to $6.4 million of provision expense recorded in 2018 and $3.0 million of provision expense recorded in 2017. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $50.7 million, and represented 1.25% of the loan portfolio, versus an allowance for loan losses of $48.5 million at the end of 2018, which represented 1.24% of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses was $47.1 million at the end of 2017, which represented 1.23% of the loan portfolio. The provision in 2018 and 2017 was attributable to the increasing size of the loan portfolio with consideration to the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs (recoveries). Net charge-offs of $1.0 million, or 0.03% of average loans, and net charge-offs of $5.1, or 0.13% of average loans, were recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provision expense for 2019, 2018, and 2017 was attributable to a number of factors but was primarily determined based on key loan quality metrics, including the level of net charge-offs, strong reserve coverage of nonperforming loans, a decrease in historical loss percentages, stable economic conditions in the Company's markets and general signs of improvement in borrower performance. In addition, management gave consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Management's overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses. The Company's management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels, asset quality, economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents changes in the components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change From\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth advisory fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment brokerage fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan and service fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchant card fee income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (29.6)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net securities gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 384.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (256.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (2.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 40,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income to total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income was $45.0 million in 2019 versus $40.3 million in 2018, an increase of $4.7 million, or 11.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.0 million increase in other income related to $1.7 million of swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as life insurance proceeds on bank owned life insurance policies. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by increases in bank owned life insurance income, loan and service fees, mortgage banking income, and wealth advisory and brokerage fees due to continued growth of client relationships. Offsetting the increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts driven by lower treasury management fees from a single commercial treasury management relationship. This relationship contributed $4.5 million to services charges on deposit accounts during 2019. The related treasury management activity was terminated and the revenue will not recur in future periods.\nNoninterest income was $40.3 million in 2018 versus $36.0 million in 2017, an increase of $4.3 million, or 11.8%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.1 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts driven by growth in fees from business accounts. In addition, wealth advisory fees increased $863,000 due to new business development, as well as growth in assets managed for existing clients. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by growth in the amount of $1.4 million in loan and service fees. Noninterest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in bank owned life insurance income which declined by $524,000, or 29.6%, primarily due to a variable bank owned life insurance product that contains equity based investments.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents changes in the components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change From\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 49,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 48,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 45,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing fees and supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and business development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (5.4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 89,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 86,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 79,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $89.4 million in 2019 versus $86.2 million in 2018, an increase of $3.2 million, or 3.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.1 million primarily due to an increase in staffing in revenue producing and risk management areas as well as normal merit increases. Professional fees increased due to higher legal expenses and increased utilization of accounting firms for outsourced services. Data processing fees also increased during 2019 primarily due to the Company's continued investment in customer focused, technology-based solutions and ongoing cybersecurity and data management enhancements. Offsetting these increases were decreases in FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees as well as decreases in corporate and business development. In the third quarter of 2019, the FDIC announced that due to the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio exceeding 1.38%, banks with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion would be receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments. The bank's $1.1 million credit was applied as a reduction of FDIC assessments commencing with the payment of the second quarter assessment paid in September 2019 and is expected to be fully utilized by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\nNoninterest expense was $86.2 million in 2018 versus $79.3 million in 2017, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $3.0 million primarily due to an increase to the Company's minimum hiring wage, normal merit increases, equity-based compensation expense and increased health insurance cost. Data processing fees also increased during 2018 by $1.5 million primarily due to the Company's continued investment in technology-based solutions and ongoing transition to cloud-based technology. Occupancy and equipment costs increased during 2018 due to continued branch expansion and remodeling of existing branches and other offices. In addition, corporate and business development expense increased due to higher community support and donation expense. The increase in other expense was largely due to accruals of expense for customer reimbursements that will be made in 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognized income tax expense in 2019 of $20.3 million, compared to $18.5 million in 2018 and $32.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2019 was 18.9% compared to 18.7% in 2018, and 36.0% in 2017. The effective tax rate was lower in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2017 due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. Results for 2017 included income tax provision of $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For a detailed analysis of the Company's income taxes see Note 13 - Income Taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOverview\nTotal assets of the Company were $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $71.5 million, or 1.5%, when compared to $4.875 billion as of December 31, 2018. Total loans increased by $151.1 million, or 3.9%, to $4.066 billion at December 31, 2019 from $3.915 billion at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $117.5 million and available-for-sale securities increased by $22.7 million. Funding for the loan and investment growth came from an $89.8 million increase in total deposits as well as a $56.1 million increase in retained earnings, offset by a $106.5 million decrease in total borrowings. The Company used wholesale funding, including brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, to provide liquidity for loan growth and to help maintain its desired interest rate risk position.\nUses of Funds\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe amortized cost and the fair value of securities as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(fully tax equivalent basis dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities available for sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 997\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government sponsored agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,122\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 314,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 313,774\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,211\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 270,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 216,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,389\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt securities available for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 591,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 608,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 591,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 585,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 537,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 538,493\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt year-end 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government, government agencies and government sponsored agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders' equity.

In 2017, net loan balances increased by $344.1 million to $3.771 billion, which excludes approximately $54.2 million in loans originated for sale and $88,000 transferred to other real estate in 2017.\nThe mix of loan types within the Company's portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans. This higher percentage of commercial loans to the total portfolio was a result of the Company's long standing strategic plan that is focused on organic expansion and growth in commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans together with owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represent 49.2% and 50.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The owner-occupied commercial real estate loans tend to represent the real estate holding of our commercial and industrial loan customers. Another significant loan segment are loans to the agri-business sector, which has resulted in the Company becoming one of the largest agricultural lenders in the State of Indiana.\nThe residential construction and land development loans class included construction loans totaling $8.1 million, $12.5 million, $10.0 million, $11.4 million and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Bank generally sells conforming mortgage loans which it originates on the secondary market. These loans generally represent mortgage loans that are made to clients with long-term or substantial relationships with the Bank on terms consistent with secondary market requirements. The loan classifications are based on the nature of the loans as of the loan origination date. There were no foreign loans included in the loan portfolio for the periods presented.\nRepricing opportunities of the loan portfolio occur either according to predetermined float rate indices, adjustable rate schedules included in the related loan agreements or upon maturity of each principal payment.

The increase during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional life insurance policies on officers of the Bank. The increases during 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to investment returns on the life insurance policies of pre-existing life insurance policies. Bank owned life insurance provides investment income from the securities the life insurance is invested in and offsets benefit plan expenses.\nSources of Funds\nThe average daily deposits and

increased by $89.8 million to $4.134 billion, comparing December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018. The growth in deposits consisted of $141.1 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $51.4 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $200.6 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $28.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $88.4 million. The growth in deposits in 2019 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2019.\nTotal deposits increased by $35.4 million to $4.044 billion, comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017. The growth in deposits consisted of $135.5 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $100.1 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $112.4 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $57.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $34.7 million. The growth in deposits in 2018 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2018.\nAs previously noted, 27% of the Company's deposit base is attributable to public fund entities which primarily represent customers in the Company's geographic footprint. A shift in funding away from public fund deposits could require the Company to\nexecute alternative funding plans under the Contingency Funding Plan discussed in further detail under Liquidity Risk\u201d below.

In addition, on December 30, 2019, the Company redeemed $30.0 million of subordinated debentures price at three-month LIBOR plus 305 basis points. Ending balances of total short-term borrowings decreased $75.6 million during 2019 to $170.0 million, due to decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Short-term Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) borrowings are used to fund short-term balance sheet growth due to the flexible nature of the financial instrument and allows the Company to prudently lend to commercial or retail borrowers when opportunities are presented.\nDuring 2018, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $63.9 million to $115.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in advances. Ending balances of total short-term borrowings increased $94.9 million during 2018 to $245.6 million, due to increases in FHLB advances that typically increase at the end of the year.\nCapital\nThe Company believes that a strong, appropriately managed capital position is critical to long-term earnings and continuing growth in loans. Capital is used primarily to fund continued organic loan growth and to support dividends per share to shareholders. The Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.4%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 13.2% and a common Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.2% as of December 31, 2019. These ratios met or exceeded the Federal Reserve Bank's well-capitalized\u201d minimums of 10.0%, 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively. The Company also had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.7% and a tangible equity ratio of 12.0%. See Note 16 - Capital Requirements for more information.\nThe ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy. Total stockholders' equity increased by 14.6% to $598.0 million as of December 31, 2019 from $521.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company earned $87.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.16 per share in 2019, which decreased equity by $29.7 million. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.00 per share in 2018, which decreased equity by $25.3 million. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was largely due to changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities which increased equity by $18.3 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of $5.3 million in 2018. The impact to equity due to other comprehensive income is not included in regulatory capital.\nOn January 14, 2020, the board of directors (the Board\u201d) reauthorized the purchase of up to $30.0 million worth of shares of the Company's common stock, representing approximately 2.4% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019. The Board reauthorized this stock repurchase plan based on the strength of the Company's balance sheet and capital position. The Board believes that a stock repurchase plan is an important tool that can be utilized to enhance long term shareholder value. Share repurchases may be made periodically as permitted by securities laws and other legal and regulatory requirements and will be subject to market conditions as well as other factors. The timing, price and quantity of purchases will be at the discretion of the corporation and the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through block trades or otherwise, and in privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization expires annually on January 31, 2020 and is subject to Board and regulatory approvals.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nThe Company, with the oversight of the Corporate Risk Committee of the Board, has developed a company-wide risk management program intended to help identify, manage and mitigate the various business risks the Company is exposed to. Following is a discussion addressing the risks identified as most significant to the Company - Credit, Liquidity, Interest Rate and Market Risk.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nNet income in 2019 was $87.0 million, up 8.3% from $80.4 million in 2018 and up 51.8% from $57.3 million in 2017. Diluted net income per common share was $3.38 in 2019, $3.13 in 2018 and $2.23 in 2017. Return on average total assets was 1.76% in 2019 versus 1.69% in 2018 and 1.29% in 2017. Return on average total equity was 15.47% in 2019 versus 16.51% in 2018 and 12.72% in 2017. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 34.32% in 2019, 31.95% in 2018 and 38.12% in 2017. The average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38% in 2019 compared to 10.24% in 2018 and 10.15% in 2017.\nNet income in 2019 was positively impacted by a $4.7 million increase in noninterest income, a $3.8 million increase in net interest income and a $3.2 million decrease in the provision for loan losses. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $3.2 million increase in noninterest expense.\nNet income in 2018 was positively impacted by a $15.4 million increase in net interest income and a $4.3 million increase in noninterest income. In addition, income tax expense decreased $13.8 million from 2017. The decrease was largely due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which lowered the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35%. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $6.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a $3.4 million increase in the provision for loan losses, respectively.\nTotal assets were $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019 versus $4.875 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $71.5 million or 1.5%. This increase was primarily due to a $148.9 million increase in total loans, and a $22.7 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $117.5 million. Total average assets increased $183.5 million primarily due to average loans increasing $130.6 million in 2019, and a $41.2 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCertain of the Company's accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation and other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans, although the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged against the allowance. A provision for loan losses is taken based on management's ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance. A formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted monthly. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company's control.\nThe level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio, emerging market risk, emerging concentration risk, commercial loan focus and large credit concentration, new industry lending activity, general economic conditions and historical loss analysis. In addition, management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Furthermore, management's overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision.\nThe determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates by management. The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors: changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay. Consideration is not limited to these factors although they represent the most commonly cited factors. With respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits, management considers the current valuation of collateral and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows as the primary measures. Management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits. With respect to pools of similar loans,\nallocations are assigned based upon historical experience subject to a floor, unless the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical losses as noted below. A detailed analysis is performed on loans that are classified but determined not to be impaired which incorporates different scenarios where the risk that the borrower will be unable or unwilling to repay its debt in full or on time is combined with an estimate of loss in the event the borrower cannot pay to develop non-specific allocations for such loan pools. These allocations may be adjusted based on the other factors cited above. An appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined by portfolio segment using historical loss percentages subject to a floor, supplemented with other environmental factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and impaired loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedure, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. It is also possible that the following could affect the overall process: social, political, economic and terrorist events or activities. All of these factors are susceptible to change, which may be significant. As a result of this detailed process, the allowance results in two forms of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nCommercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration function. These grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a consensus is reached by credit administration and the loan review officer. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that indicate the loan is impaired. Considerations with respect to specific allocations for these individual credits include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) does the customer's cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan; (b) is there adequate collateral to repay the loan; (c) has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination; (d) is the loan impaired; (e) are there other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question; or (f) are there unique loan characteristics that require special monitoring.\nAllocations are also applied to categories of loans considered not to be individually impaired, but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. In addition, general allocations are made for other pools of loans, including non-classified loans. These general pooled loan allocations are performed for portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and multi-family, agri-business and agricultural, other commercial, consumer 1-4 family mortgage and other consumer loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a three-year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios, subject to a floor, and are adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends.\nDue to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses, the Company's allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component. The unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the Company's judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations, including factors such as the level of classified credits, economic uncertainties, industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments, broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the Company's large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers.\nValuation and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Available-for-Sale Investment Securities\nThe fair values of securities available-for-sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models, which utilize significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing. This is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. The fair value of certain securities is determined using unobservable inputs, primarily observable inputs of similar securities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. Impairment is other-than-temporary if the decline in the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security will not be received.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining impairment, which includes making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining other-than-temporary impairment for a security or investment:\n \u25cf the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; \n \u25cf the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; \n \u25cf the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and \n \u25cf our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \nThe assessment of whether a decline exists that is other-than-temporary, involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. If, in management's judgment, other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down to the computed net present value, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings (as if the loss had been realized in the period of other-than-temporary impairment).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nIn 2019 and 2018, the Company continued to grow loans and deposits organically, in its geographic footprint of northern Indiana and in central Indiana in the Indianapolis market. The Company had 50 branches as of December 31, 2019. The Company's profitability has been positively impacted by growth in loans and deposits. In addition, asset quality has remained stable. The core banking contributions to noninterest income of mortgage banking, loan and wealth management fee income increased in 2019. Overall, expense growth has reflected our continued investment in people, technology and our branch infrastructure.

bearing liabilities used to calculate interest differentials are based on average daily balances for 2019, 2018 and 2017. The changes in net interest income are created by changes in interest rates and changes in the volumes of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. In the table above, changes attributable to volume are computed using the change in volume from the prior year multiplied by the previous year's rate, and changes attributable to rate are computed using the change in rate from the prior year multiplied by the previous year's volume. The change in interest or expense due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. \n (2) Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and 35 percent tax rate for 2017. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the TEFRA adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expense. \nNet interest income increased by $3.8 million to $155.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a 17 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets to 4.67% from 4.50%. In addition, average earning assets increased $195.3 million, or 4.4%, in 2019, driven by an increase of 3.8% in the average commercial loan portfolio, which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending. The net interest margin decreased to 3.38% in 2019 versus 3.43% in 2018, due to higher costs on average interest bearing liabilities, which offset an increase in the yield of earning assets during 2019. Net interest income increased by $15.4 million to $151.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a 46 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets to 4.50% from 4.04%. In addition, average earning assets increased $278.3 million, or 6.7% in 2018, driven by an increase of 6.2% in the average commercial loan portfolio, which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending. The net interest margin increased to 3.43% in 2018 versus 3.33% in 2017, due to higher yields on average earning assets, which more than offset an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities during 2018.\nGrowth in the commercial loan portfolio accounted for most of the growth in loans, as well as total earning assets, during both 2019 and 2018 and positively impacted total interest income. Management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio will likely continue in a measured and prudent fashion as a result of our continued strategic focus on commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. Loan growth was slower in 2019 and 2018 as compared to prior years due to a slowdown in manufacturing and industrial loans. In addition, the utilization of commercial lines of credit has dropped in 2019 and 2018 due to softened loan demand. Management believes its organic growth strategy of continued expansion in its current geographic footprint and in Indianapolis will provide continued loan growth opportunities. During 2019, growth in average loans of $130.6 million and growth in available-for-sale investment securities of $41.2 million was funded through an increase in deposits. Average demand deposits increased $86.1 million in 2019 and average interest bearing deposit accounts increased $62.5 million.\nThe increase in the Company's yields on average earning assets during 2019 and 2018 resulted from increases in market rates overall, including increases in loan portfolio yields during both years. In the third and fourth quarter of 2019, market rates were impacted by three Federal Reserve Bank decreases of 25 basis points each in the Federal Funds Rate, which occurred in July 2019, September 2019, and October 2019. However, the impact of these decreases was not felt until later in the second half of 2019. During 2019 management continued to focus on growing the commercial portfolio in a prudent and responsible manner. The cost of funds was also impacted by the decreases in the Federal Funds Rate during the second half of 2019. However, given the asset-sensitive nature of the Company's balance sheet, loan interest rates repriced quicker than deposit interest costs, resulting in margin compression in the second half of 2019.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nIn 2019 the Company recorded provision for loan loss expense of $3.2 million primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio. The 2019 provision expense compares to $6.4 million of provision expense recorded in 2018 and $3.0 million of provision expense recorded in 2017. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $50.7 million, and represented 1.25% of the loan portfolio, versus an allowance for loan losses of $48.5 million at the end of 2018, which represented 1.24% of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses was $47.1 million at the end of 2017, which represented 1.23% of the loan portfolio. The provision in 2018 and 2017 was attributable to the increasing size of the loan portfolio with consideration to the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs (recoveries). Net charge-offs of $1.0 million, or 0.03% of average loans, and net charge-offs of $5.1, or 0.13% of average loans, were recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provision expense for 2019, 2018, and 2017 was attributable to a number of factors but was primarily determined based on key loan quality metrics, including the level of net charge-offs, strong reserve coverage of nonperforming loans, a decrease in historical loss percentages, stable economic conditions in the Company's markets and general signs of improvement in borrower performance. In addition, management gave consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Management's overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses. The Company's management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels, asset quality, economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents changes in the components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change From\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth advisory fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment brokerage fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan and service fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchant card fee income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (29.6)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net securities gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 384.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (256.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (2.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 40,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income to total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income was $45.0 million in 2019 versus $40.3 million in 2018, an increase of $4.7 million, or 11.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.0 million increase in other income related to $1.7 million of swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as life insurance proceeds on bank owned life insurance policies. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by increases in bank owned life insurance income, loan and service fees, mortgage banking income, and wealth advisory and brokerage fees due to continued growth of client relationships. Offsetting the increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts driven by lower treasury management fees from a single commercial treasury management relationship. This relationship contributed $4.5 million to services charges on deposit accounts during 2019. The related treasury management activity was terminated and the revenue will not recur in future periods.\nNoninterest income was $40.3 million in 2018 versus $36.0 million in 2017, an increase of $4.3 million, or 11.8%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.1 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts driven by growth in fees from business accounts. In addition, wealth advisory fees increased $863,000 due to new business development, as well as growth in assets managed for existing clients. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by growth in the amount of $1.4 million in loan and service fees. Noninterest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in bank owned life insurance income which declined by $524,000, or 29.6%, primarily due to a variable bank owned life insurance product that contains equity based investments.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents changes in the components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change From\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 49,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 48,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 45,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing fees and supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and business development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (5.4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 89,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 86,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 79,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $89.4 million in 2019 versus $86.2 million in 2018, an increase of $3.2 million, or 3.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.1 million primarily due to an increase in staffing in revenue producing and risk management areas as well as normal merit increases. Professional fees increased due to higher legal expenses and increased utilization of accounting firms for outsourced services. Data processing fees also increased during 2019 primarily due to the Company's continued investment in customer focused, technology-based solutions and ongoing cybersecurity and data management enhancements. Offsetting these increases were decreases in FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees as well as decreases in corporate and business development. In the third quarter of 2019, the FDIC announced that due to the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio exceeding 1.38%, banks with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion would be receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments. The bank's $1.1 million credit was applied as a reduction of FDIC assessments commencing with the payment of the second quarter assessment paid in September 2019 and is expected to be fully utilized by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\nNoninterest expense was $86.2 million in 2018 versus $79.3 million in 2017, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $3.0 million primarily due to an increase to the Company's minimum hiring wage, normal merit increases, equity-based compensation expense and increased health insurance cost. Data processing fees also increased during 2018 by $1.5 million primarily due to the Company's continued investment in technology-based solutions and ongoing transition to cloud-based technology. Occupancy and equipment costs increased during 2018 due to continued branch expansion and remodeling of existing branches and other offices. In addition, corporate and business development expense increased due to higher community support and donation expense. The increase in other expense was largely due to accruals of expense for customer reimbursements that will be made in 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognized income tax expense in 2019 of $20.3 million, compared to $18.5 million in 2018 and $32.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2019 was 18.9% compared to 18.7% in 2018, and 36.0% in 2017. The effective tax rate was lower in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2017 due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. Results for 2017 included income tax provision of $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For a detailed analysis of the Company's income taxes see Note 13 - Income Taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOverview\nTotal assets of the Company were $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $71.5 million, or 1.5%, when compared to $4.875 billion as of December 31, 2018. Total loans increased by $151.1 million, or 3.9%, to $4.066 billion at December 31, 2019 from $3.915 billion at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $117.5 million and available-for-sale securities increased by $22.7 million. Funding for the loan and investment growth came from an $89.8 million increase in total deposits as well as a $56.1 million increase in retained earnings, offset by a $106.5 million decrease in total borrowings. The Company used wholesale funding, including brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, to provide liquidity for loan growth and to help maintain its desired interest rate risk position.\nUses of Funds\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe amortized cost and the fair value of securities as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(fully tax equivalent basis dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities available for sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 997\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government sponsored agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,122\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 314,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 313,774\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,211\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 270,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 216,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,389\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt securities available for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 591,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 608,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 591,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 585,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 537,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 538,493\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt year-end 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government, government agencies and government sponsored agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders' equity.

increased by $148.9 million to $4.015 billion, which excludes approximately $66.0 million in loans originated for sale. In 2018, net loan balances increased by $95.0 million to $3.866 billion, which excludes approximately $49.8 million in loans originated for sale and $316,000 transferred to other real estate in 2018. In 2017, net loan balances increased by $344.1 million to $3.771 billion, which excludes approximately $54.2 million in loans originated for sale and $88,000 transferred to other real estate in 2017.\nThe mix of loan types within the Company's portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans. This higher percentage of commercial loans to the total portfolio was a result of the Company's long standing strategic plan that is focused on organic expansion and growth in commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans together with owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represent 49.2% and 50.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The owner-occupied commercial real estate loans tend to represent the real estate holding of our commercial and industrial loan customers. Another significant loan segment are loans to the agri-business sector, which has resulted in the Company becoming one of the largest agricultural lenders in the State of Indiana.\nThe residential construction and land development loans class included construction loans totaling $8.1 million, $12.5 million, $10.0 million, $11.4 million and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Bank generally sells conforming mortgage loans which it originates on the secondary market. These loans generally represent mortgage loans that are made to clients with long-term or substantial relationships with the Bank on terms consistent with secondary market requirements. The loan classifications are based on the nature of the loans as of the loan origination date. There were no foreign loans included in the loan portfolio for the periods presented.\nRepricing opportunities of the loan portfolio occur either according to predetermined float rate indices, adjustable rate schedules included in the related loan agreements or upon maturity of each principal payment.

The increase during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional life insurance policies on officers of the Bank. The increases during 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to investment returns on the life insurance policies of pre-existing life insurance policies. Bank owned life insurance provides investment income from the securities the life insurance is invested in and offsets benefit plan expenses.\nSources of Funds\nThe average daily deposits and

increased by $89.8 million to $4.134 billion, comparing December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018. The growth in deposits consisted of $141.1 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $51.4 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $200.6 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $28.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $88.4 million. The growth in deposits in 2019 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2019.\nTotal deposits increased by $35.4 million to $4.044 billion, comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017. The growth in deposits consisted of $135.5 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $100.1 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $112.4 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $57.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $34.7 million. The growth in deposits in 2018 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2018.\nAs previously noted, 27% of the Company's deposit base is attributable to public fund entities which primarily represent customers in the Company's geographic footprint. A shift in funding away from public fund deposits could require the Company to\nexecute alternative funding plans under the Contingency Funding Plan discussed in further detail under Liquidity Risk\u201d below. The following table presents total deposits by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,617,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,588,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,530,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,276,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,075,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 963,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,127,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,215,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,020,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,879,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,743,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 164,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 264,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,133,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,044,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,008,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFHLB Advances and Other Borrowings\nDuring 2019, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $54.5 million to $61.3 million, primarily due to the discontinuance of securities sold under agreements to repurchase products in 2019. In addition, on December 30, 2019, the Company redeemed $30.0 million of subordinated debentures price at three-month LIBOR plus 305 basis points. Ending balances of total short-term borrowings decreased $75.6 million during 2019 to $170.0 million, due to decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Short-term Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) borrowings are used to fund short-term balance sheet growth due to the flexible nature of the financial instrument and allows the Company to prudently lend to commercial or retail borrowers when opportunities are presented.\nDuring 2018, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $63.9 million to $115.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in advances. Ending balances of total short-term borrowings increased $94.9 million during 2018 to $245.6 million, due to increases in FHLB advances that typically increase at the end of the year.\nCapital\nThe Company believes that a strong, appropriately managed capital position is critical to long-term earnings and continuing growth in loans. Capital is used primarily to fund continued organic loan growth and to support dividends per share to shareholders. The Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.4%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 13.2% and a common Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.2% as of December 31, 2019. These ratios met or exceeded the Federal Reserve Bank's well-capitalized\u201d minimums of 10.0%, 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively. The Company also had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.7% and a tangible equity ratio of 12.0%. See Note 16 - Capital Requirements for more information.\nThe ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy. Total stockholders' equity increased by 14.6% to $598.0 million as of December 31, 2019 from $521.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company earned $87.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.16 per share in 2019, which decreased equity by $29.7 million. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.00 per share in 2018, which decreased equity by $25.3 million. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was largely due to changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities which increased equity by $18.3 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of $5.3 million in 2018. The impact to equity due to other comprehensive income is not included in regulatory capital.\nOn January 14, 2020, the board of directors (the Board\u201d) reauthorized the purchase of up to $30.0 million worth of shares of the Company's common stock, representing approximately 2.4% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019. The Board reauthorized this stock repurchase plan based on the strength of the Company's balance sheet and capital position. The Board believes that a stock repurchase plan is an important tool that can be utilized to enhance long term shareholder value. Share repurchases may be made periodically as permitted by securities laws and other legal and regulatory requirements and will be subject to market conditions as well as other factors. The timing, price and quantity of purchases will be at the discretion of the corporation and the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through block trades or otherwise, and in privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization expires annually on January 31, 2020 and is subject to Board and regulatory approvals.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nThe Company, with the oversight of the Corporate Risk Committee of the Board, has developed a company-wide risk management program intended to help identify, manage and mitigate the various business risks the Company is exposed to. Following is a discussion addressing the risks identified as most significant to the Company - Credit, Liquidity, Interest Rate and Market Risk.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nNet income in 2019 was $87.0 million, up 8.3% from $80.4 million in 2018 and up 51.8% from $57.3 million in 2017. Diluted net income per common share was $3.38 in 2019, $3.13 in 2018 and $2.23 in 2017. Return on average total assets was 1.76% in 2019 versus 1.69% in 2018 and 1.29% in 2017. Return on average total equity was 15.47% in 2019 versus 16.51% in 2018 and 12.72% in 2017. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 34.32% in 2019, 31.95% in 2018 and 38.12% in 2017. The average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38% in 2019 compared to 10.24% in 2018 and 10.15% in 2017.\nNet income in 2019 was positively impacted by a $4.7 million increase in noninterest income, a $3.8 million increase in net interest income and a $3.2 million decrease in the provision for loan losses. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $3.2 million increase in noninterest expense.\nNet income in 2018 was positively impacted by a $15.4 million increase in net interest income and a $4.3 million increase in noninterest income. In addition, income tax expense decreased $13.8 million from 2017. The decrease was largely due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which lowered the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35%. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $6.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a $3.4 million increase in the provision for loan losses, respectively.\nTotal assets were $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019 versus $4.875 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $71.5 million or 1.5%. This increase was primarily due to a $148.9 million increase in total loans, and a $22.7 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $117.5 million. Total average assets increased $183.5 million primarily due to average loans increasing $130.6 million in 2019, and a $41.2 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCertain of the Company's accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation and other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans, although the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged against the allowance. A provision for loan losses is taken based on management's ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance. A formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted monthly. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company's control.\nThe level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio, emerging market risk, emerging concentration risk, commercial loan focus and large credit concentration, new industry lending activity, general economic conditions and historical loss analysis. In addition, management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Furthermore, management's overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision.\nThe determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates by management. The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors: changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay. Consideration is not limited to these factors although they represent the most commonly cited factors. With respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits, management considers the current valuation of collateral and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows as the primary measures. Management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits. With respect to pools of similar loans,\nallocations are assigned based upon historical experience subject to a floor, unless the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical losses as noted below. A detailed analysis is performed on loans that are classified but determined not to be impaired which incorporates different scenarios where the risk that the borrower will be unable or unwilling to repay its debt in full or on time is combined with an estimate of loss in the event the borrower cannot pay to develop non-specific allocations for such loan pools. These allocations may be adjusted based on the other factors cited above. An appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined by portfolio segment using historical loss percentages subject to a floor, supplemented with other environmental factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and impaired loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedure, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. It is also possible that the following could affect the overall process: social, political, economic and terrorist events or activities. All of these factors are susceptible to change, which may be significant. As a result of this detailed process, the allowance results in two forms of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nCommercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration function. These grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a consensus is reached by credit administration and the loan review officer. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that indicate the loan is impaired. Considerations with respect to specific allocations for these individual credits include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) does the customer's cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan; (b) is there adequate collateral to repay the loan; (c) has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination; (d) is the loan impaired; (e) are there other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question; or (f) are there unique loan characteristics that require special monitoring.\nAllocations are also applied to categories of loans considered not to be individually impaired, but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. In addition, general allocations are made for other pools of loans, including non-classified loans. These general pooled loan allocations are performed for portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and multi-family, agri-business and agricultural, other commercial, consumer 1-4 family mortgage and other consumer loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a three-year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios, subject to a floor, and are adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends.\nDue to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses, the Company's allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component. The unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the Company's judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations, including factors such as the level of classified credits, economic uncertainties, industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments, broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the Company's large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers.\nValuation and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Available-for-Sale Investment Securities\nThe fair values of securities available-for-sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models, which utilize significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing. This is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. The fair value of certain securities is determined using unobservable inputs, primarily observable inputs of similar securities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. Impairment is other-than-temporary if the decline in the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security will not be received.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining impairment, which includes making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining other-than-temporary impairment for a security or investment:\n \u25cf the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; \n \u25cf the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; \n \u25cf the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and \n \u25cf our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \nThe assessment of whether a decline exists that is other-than-temporary, involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. If, in management's judgment, other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down to the computed net present value, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings (as if the loss had been realized in the period of other-than-temporary impairment).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nIn 2019 and 2018, the Company continued to grow loans and deposits organically, in its geographic footprint of northern Indiana and in central Indiana in the Indianapolis market. The Company had 50 branches as of December 31, 2019. The Company's profitability has been positively impacted by growth in loans and deposits. In addition, asset quality has remained stable. The core banking contributions to noninterest income of mortgage banking, loan and wealth management fee income increased in 2019. Overall, expense growth has reflected our continued investment in people, technology and our branch infrastructure. The outlook for 2020 includes plans for continued organic loan and deposit growth, a disciplined credit philosophy, continued investment in the Company in the form of staff additions, continued expansion in our geographic footprint, continued investments in customer facing technology and cybersecurity risk management tools.\nSelected income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table.\n\n (1) Noninterest expense/Net interest income plus Noninterest income. \n (2) Tangible common equity, tangible assets, and the tangible capital ratio are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of equity, net of deferred tax. Tangible assets are calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of total assets, net of deferred tax. The tangible capital ratio is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by tangible assets. \nNet Income\nNet income was $87.0 million in 2019, an increase of $6.6 million, or 8.3%, versus net income of $80.4 million in 2018. The increase in net income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to the increase in noninterest income of $4.7 million, or 11.6%. In\naddition, net interest income increased $3.8 million, or 2.5%, to $155.0 million versus $151.3 million in 2018 and the provision for loan losses decreased $3.2 million, or 49.5%. Noninterest expense increased by $3.2 million, or 3.7% and income tax expense increased $1.8 million, or 9.7%.\nNet income was $80.4 million in 2018, an increase of $23.1 million, or 40.3%, versus net income of $57.3 million in 2017. The increase in net income from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to the increase in net interest income in the amount of $15.4 million, or 11.3%, to $151.3 million versus $135.9 million in 2017. In addition, income tax expense decreased by $13.8 million to $18.5 million and noninterest income increased $4.3 million to $40.3 million, offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision expense of $6.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents a three-year average balance sheet and, for each major asset and liability category, its related interest income and yield or its expense and rate for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTHREE YEAR AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET AND NET INTEREST ANALYSIS\n\n (1) Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and 35 percent tax rate for 2017. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ( TEFRA\u201d) adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expenses. Taxable equivalent basis adjustments were $2.1 million, $1.8 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (2) Loan fees, which are immaterial in relation to total taxable loan interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, are included as taxable loan interest income. \n (3) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance of taxable loans. \nThe following table shows fluctuations in net interest income attributable to changes in the average balances of assets and liabilities and the yields earned or rates paid for the years ended December 31.\nNET INTEREST INCOME - RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS (fully tax equivalent basis, dollars in thousands)\n\n (1) The earning assets and interest bearing liabilities used to calculate interest differentials are based on average daily balances for 2019, 2018 and 2017. The changes in net interest income are created by changes in interest rates and changes in the volumes of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. In the table above, changes attributable to volume are computed using the change in volume from the prior year multiplied by the previous year's rate, and changes attributable to rate are computed using the change in rate from the prior year multiplied by the previous year's volume. The change in interest or expense due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. \n (2) Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and 35 percent tax rate for 2017. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the TEFRA adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expense. \nNet interest income increased by $3.8 million to $155.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a 17 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets to 4.67% from 4.50%. In addition, average earning assets increased $195.3 million, or 4.4%, in 2019, driven by an increase of 3.8% in the average commercial loan portfolio, which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending. The net interest margin decreased to 3.38% in 2019 versus 3.43% in 2018, due to higher costs on average interest bearing liabilities, which offset an increase in the yield of earning assets during 2019. Net interest income increased by $15.4 million to $151.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a 46 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets to 4.50% from 4.04%. In addition, average earning assets increased $278.3 million, or 6.7% in 2018, driven by an increase of 6.2% in the average commercial loan portfolio, which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending. The net interest margin increased to 3.43% in 2018 versus 3.33% in 2017, due to higher yields on average earning assets, which more than offset an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities during 2018.\nGrowth in the commercial loan portfolio accounted for most of the growth in loans, as well as total earning assets, during both 2019 and 2018 and positively impacted total interest income. Management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio will likely continue in a measured and prudent fashion as a result of our continued strategic focus on commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. Loan growth was slower in 2019 and 2018 as compared to prior years due to a slowdown in manufacturing and industrial loans. In addition, the utilization of commercial lines of credit has dropped in 2019 and 2018 due to softened loan demand. Management believes its organic growth strategy of continued expansion in its current geographic footprint and in Indianapolis will provide continued loan growth opportunities. During 2019, growth in average loans of $130.6 million and growth in available-for-sale investment securities of $41.2 million was funded through an increase in deposits. Average demand deposits increased $86.1 million in 2019 and average interest bearing deposit accounts increased $62.5 million.\nThe increase in the Company's yields on average earning assets during 2019 and 2018 resulted from increases in market rates overall, including increases in loan portfolio yields during both years. In the third and fourth quarter of 2019, market rates were impacted by three Federal Reserve Bank decreases of 25 basis points each in the Federal Funds Rate, which occurred in July 2019, September 2019, and October 2019. However, the impact of these decreases was not felt until later in the second half of 2019. During 2019 management continued to focus on growing the commercial portfolio in a prudent and responsible manner. The cost of funds was also impacted by the decreases in the Federal Funds Rate during the second half of 2019. However, given the asset-sensitive nature of the Company's balance sheet, loan interest rates repriced quicker than deposit interest costs, resulting in margin compression in the second half of 2019.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nIn 2019 the Company recorded provision for loan loss expense of $3.2 million primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio. The 2019 provision expense compares to $6.4 million of provision expense recorded in 2018 and $3.0 million of provision expense recorded in 2017. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $50.7 million, and represented 1.25% of the loan portfolio, versus an allowance for loan losses of $48.5 million at the end of 2018, which represented 1.24% of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses was $47.1 million at the end of 2017, which represented 1.23% of the loan portfolio. The provision in 2018 and 2017 was attributable to the increasing size of the loan portfolio with consideration to the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs (recoveries). Net charge-offs of $1.0 million, or 0.03% of average loans, and net charge-offs of $5.1, or 0.13% of average loans, were recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provision expense for 2019, 2018, and 2017 was attributable to a number of factors but was primarily determined based on key loan quality metrics, including the level of net charge-offs, strong reserve coverage of nonperforming loans, a decrease in historical loss percentages, stable economic conditions in the Company's markets and general signs of improvement in borrower performance. In addition, management gave consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Management's overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses. The Company's management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels, asset quality, economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents changes in the components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31.\n\nNoninterest income was $45.0 million in 2019 versus $40.3 million in 2018, an increase of $4.7 million, or 11.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.0 million increase in other income related to $1.7 million of swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as life insurance proceeds on bank owned life insurance policies. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by increases in bank owned life insurance income, loan and service fees, mortgage banking income, and wealth advisory and brokerage fees due to continued growth of client relationships. Offsetting the increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts driven by lower treasury management fees from a single commercial treasury management relationship. This relationship contributed $4.5 million to services charges on deposit accounts during 2019. The related treasury management activity was terminated and the revenue will not recur in future periods.\nNoninterest income was $40.3 million in 2018 versus $36.0 million in 2017, an increase of $4.3 million, or 11.8%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.1 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts driven by growth in fees from business accounts. In addition, wealth advisory fees increased $863,000 due to new business development, as well as growth in assets managed for existing clients. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by growth in the amount of $1.4 million in loan and service fees. Noninterest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in bank owned life insurance income which declined by $524,000, or 29.6%, primarily due to a variable bank owned life insurance product that contains equity based investments.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents changes in the components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31.\n\nNoninterest expense was $89.4 million in 2019 versus $86.2 million in 2018, an increase of $3.2 million, or 3.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.1 million primarily due to an increase in staffing in revenue producing and risk management areas as well as normal merit increases. Professional fees increased due to higher legal expenses and increased utilization of accounting firms for outsourced services. Data processing fees also increased during 2019 primarily due to the Company's continued investment in customer focused, technology-based solutions and ongoing cybersecurity and data management enhancements. Offsetting these increases were decreases in FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees as well as decreases in corporate and business development. In the third quarter of 2019, the FDIC announced that due to the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio exceeding 1.38%, banks with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion would be receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments. The bank's $1.1 million credit was applied as a reduction of FDIC assessments commencing with the payment of the second quarter assessment paid in September 2019 and is expected to be fully utilized by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\nNoninterest expense was $86.2 million in 2018 versus $79.3 million in 2017, an increase of $6.9 million, or 8.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $3.0 million primarily due to an increase to the Company's minimum hiring wage, normal merit increases, equity-based compensation expense and increased health insurance cost. Data processing fees also increased during 2018 by $1.5 million primarily due to the Company's continued investment in technology-based solutions and ongoing transition to cloud-based technology. Occupancy and equipment costs increased during 2018 due to continued branch expansion and remodeling of existing branches and other offices. In addition, corporate and business development expense increased due to higher community support and donation expense. The increase in other expense was largely due to accruals of expense for customer reimbursements that will be made in 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognized income tax expense in 2019 of $20.3 million, compared to $18.5 million in 2018 and $32.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2019 was 18.9% compared to 18.7% in 2018, and 36.0% in 2017. The effective tax rate was lower in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2017 due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. Results for 2017 included income tax provision of $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For a detailed analysis of the Company's income taxes see Note 13 - Income Taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOverview\nTotal assets of the Company were $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $71.5 million, or 1.5%, when compared to $4.875 billion as of December 31, 2018. Total loans increased by $151.1 million, or 3.9%, to $4.066 billion at December 31, 2019 from $3.915 billion at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $117.5 million and available-for-sale securities increased by $22.7 million. Funding for the loan and investment growth came from an $89.8 million increase in total deposits as well as a $56.1 million increase in retained earnings, offset by a $106.5 million decrease in total borrowings. The Company used wholesale funding, including brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, to provide liquidity for loan growth and to help maintain its desired interest rate risk position.\nUses of Funds\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe amortized cost and the fair value of securities as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n\nAt year-end 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government, government agencies and government sponsored agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders' equity. See Note 2 - Securities for more information on these investments.\nPurchases of securities available-for-sale totaled $129.5 million in 2019, $126.6 million in 2018 and $139.3 million in 2017. Growth of the investment portfolio during the past three years serves to provide liquidity for the Company and provide longer duration as an offset to the short duration of the loan portfolio. The Company targets investment securities as a percentage of total assets in a range from 11% - 14%. Securities sales totaled $57.1 million in 2019, $15.3 million in 2018 and $40.9 million in 2017. Paydowns from prepayments and scheduled payments of $53.0 million, $42.8 million and $50.0 million were received in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and the amortization of premiums, net of the accretion of discounts, was $3.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Maturities and calls of securities totaled $14.8 million, $11.0 million and $11.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in 2019, 2018 or 2017. The investment portfolio is managed to provide for an appropriate balance between liquidity, credit risk and investment return and to limit the Company's exposure to risk to an acceptable level.\nThe weighted average yields and maturity distribution for the securities portfolio at December 31, 2019, were as follows:\n\nThe Company does not trade or invest in or sponsor certain unregistered investment companies defined as hedge funds and private equity funds in the Volcker Rule.\nReal Estate Mortgage Loans Held For Sale\nReal estate mortgages held for sale increased by $2.2 million to $4.5 million at December 31, 2019 from $2.3 million at December 31, 2018. This asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on, among other things, recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market. The Company generally sells almost all of the mortgage loans it originates on the secondary market. Proceeds from sales totaled $64.8 million in 2019, $51.7 million in 2018 and $57.6 million in 2017.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe loan portfolio by class as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\nThe ratio of loans to total loans by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\nIn 2019, net loan balances increased by $148.9 million to $4.015 billion, which excludes approximately $66.0 million in loans originated for sale. In 2018, net loan balances increased by $95.0 million to $3.866 billion, which excludes approximately $49.8 million in loans originated for sale and $316,000 transferred to other real estate in 2018. In 2017, net loan balances increased by $344.1 million to $3.771 billion, which excludes approximately $54.2 million in loans originated for sale and $88,000 transferred to other real estate in 2017.\nThe mix of loan types within the Company's portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans. This higher percentage of commercial loans to the total portfolio was a result of the Company's long standing strategic plan that is focused on organic expansion and growth in commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans together with owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represent 49.2% and 50.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The owner-occupied commercial real estate loans tend to represent the real estate holding of our commercial and industrial loan customers. Another significant loan segment are loans to the agri-business sector, which has resulted in the Company becoming one of the largest agricultural lenders in the State of Indiana.\nThe residential construction and land development loans class included construction loans totaling $8.1 million, $12.5 million, $10.0 million, $11.4 million and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Bank generally sells conforming mortgage loans which it originates on the secondary market. These loans generally represent mortgage loans that are made to clients with long-term or substantial relationships with the Bank on terms consistent with secondary market requirements. The loan classifications are based on the nature of the loans as of the loan origination date. There were no foreign loans included in the loan portfolio for the periods presented.\nRepricing opportunities of the loan portfolio occur either according to predetermined float rate indices, adjustable rate schedules included in the related loan agreements or upon maturity of each principal payment. The following table indicates the scheduled maturities of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019:\n\nAt maturity, credits are reviewed and, if renewed, are renewed at rates and conditions that prevail at the time of maturity.\nBased upon the table above, all loans due after one year which have a predetermined interest rate and loans due after one year which have floating or adjustable interest rates as of December 31, 2019 amounted to $1.291 billion and $1.428 billion, respectively.\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nBank owned life insurance increased by $6.7 million to $83.8 million at December 31, 2019 and by $1.2 million to $77.1 million at December 31, 2018 and from $75.9 million at December 31, 2017. The increase during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional life insurance policies on officers of the Bank. The increases during 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to investment returns on the life insurance policies of pre-existing life insurance policies. Bank owned life insurance provides investment income from the securities the life insurance is invested in and offsets benefit plan expenses.\nSources of Funds\nThe average daily deposits and borrowings together with the average rates paid on those deposits and borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are summarized in the following table:\n\nTime deposits as of December 31, 2019 will mature as follows:\n\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased by $89.8 million to $4.134 billion, comparing December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018. The growth in deposits consisted of $141.1 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $51.4 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $200.6 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $28.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $88.4 million. The growth in deposits in 2019 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2019.\nTotal deposits increased by $35.4 million to $4.044 billion, comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017. The growth in deposits consisted of $135.5 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $100.1 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $112.4 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $57.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $34.7 million. The growth in deposits in 2018 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2018.\nAs previously noted, 27% of the Company's deposit base is attributable to public fund entities which primarily represent customers in the Company's geographic footprint. A shift in funding away from public fund deposits could require the Company to\nexecute alternative funding plans under the Contingency Funding Plan discussed in further detail under Liquidity Risk\u201d below. The following table presents total deposits by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nFHLB Advances and Other Borrowings\nDuring 2019, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $54.5 million to $61.3 million, primarily due to the discontinuance of securities sold under agreements to repurchase products in 2019. In addition, on December 30, 2019, the Company redeemed $30.0 million of subordinated debentures price at three-month LIBOR plus 305 basis points. Ending balances of total short-term borrowings decreased $75.6 million during 2019 to $170.0 million, due to decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Short-term Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) borrowings are used to fund short-term balance sheet growth due to the flexible nature of the financial instrument and allows the Company to prudently lend to commercial or retail borrowers when opportunities are presented.\nDuring 2018, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $63.9 million to $115.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in advances. Ending balances of total short-term borrowings increased $94.9 million during 2018 to $245.6 million, due to increases in FHLB advances that typically increase at the end of the year.\nCapital\nThe Company believes that a strong, appropriately managed capital position is critical to long-term earnings and continuing growth in loans. Capital is used primarily to fund continued organic loan growth and to support dividends per share to shareholders. The Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.4%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 13.2% and a common Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.2% as of December 31, 2019. These ratios met or exceeded the Federal Reserve Bank's well-capitalized\u201d minimums of 10.0%, 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively. The Company also had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.7% and a tangible equity ratio of 12.0%. See Note 16 - Capital Requirements for more information.\nThe ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy. Total stockholders' equity increased by 14.6% to $598.0 million as of December 31, 2019 from $521.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company earned $87.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.16 per share in 2019, which decreased equity by $29.7 million. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.00 per share in 2018, which decreased equity by $25.3 million. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was largely due to changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities which increased equity by $18.3 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of $5.3 million in 2018. The impact to equity due to other comprehensive income is not included in regulatory capital.\nOn January 14, 2020, the board of directors (the Board\u201d) reauthorized the purchase of up to $30.0 million worth of shares of the Company's common stock, representing approximately 2.4% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019. The Board reauthorized this stock repurchase plan based on the strength of the Company's balance sheet and capital position. The Board believes that a stock repurchase plan is an important tool that can be utilized to enhance long term shareholder value. Share repurchases may be made periodically as permitted by securities laws and other legal and regulatory requirements and will be subject to market conditions as well as other factors. The timing, price and quantity of purchases will be at the discretion of the corporation and the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through block trades or otherwise, and in privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization expires annually on January 31, 2020 and is subject to Board and regulatory approvals.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nThe Company, with the oversight of the Corporate Risk Committee of the Board, has developed a company-wide risk management program intended to help identify, manage and mitigate the various business risks the Company is exposed to. Following is a discussion addressing the risks identified as most significant to the Company - Credit, Liquidity, Interest Rate and Market Risk.", "item_7_tables": "Table 47: <table><tr><td>\n</td>

summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Net income increased 8.3% to $87.0 million in 2019, primarily due to increases in noninterest income, net interest income, and a decrease in provision for loan losses. This was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n- Key critical accounting policies discussed are the allowance for loan losses and valuation/impairment of investment securities. These involve significant management judgment and estimates.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Net interest income increased in 2019 and 2018 due to loan growth and higher yields on earning assets. Net interest margin decreased slightly in 2019 due to higher funding costs. \n- Noninterest income increased in 2019 and 2018 driven by service charges, wealth management fees, and other fee income sources.\n- Noninterest expense rose in 2019 and 2018 reflecting continued investments in people, technology, infrastructure, and cybersecurity.\n- Income taxes decreased in 2019 and 2018 due to the lower federal tax rate from tax reform.\n\nFinancial Condition\n- Total assets were $4.947 billion at December 31, 2019, up 1.5% year-over-year. Loan growth of 3.9% was the main driver.  Funding came from deposit growth and retained earnings. \n- The loan portfolio continues to shift towards a greater mix of commercial loans.\n- Total deposits grew 3.6% in 2019 through core deposit growth. This allowed a decrease in wholesale funding reliance.\n\nRisk Management \n- Key risks discussed are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Risk oversight involves Board and management review of risk metrics."}
