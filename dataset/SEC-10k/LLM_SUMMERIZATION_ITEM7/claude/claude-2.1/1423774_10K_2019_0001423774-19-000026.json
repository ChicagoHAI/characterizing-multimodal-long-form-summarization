Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31.\nOverview\nBusiness Summary\nZuora is a leading cloud-based subscription management platform. We provide software that enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage or transform to a subscription business model. Architected specifically for dynamic, recurring subscription business models, our cloud-based software functions as an intelligent subscription management hub that automates and orchestrates the entire subscription order-to-revenue process, including billing and revenue recognition. Our solution enables businesses to easily change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, to efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, and to build meaningful relationships with their subscribers.\nWe believe we are in the early stages of a multi-decade global shift away from product-based business models, characterized by transactional one-time sales, towards recurring subscription-based business models. This trend, which we refer to as the Subscription Economy,\u201d is visible everywhere you look. In media and entertainment, consumers are adopting video-on-demand services and digital music streaming services. Commuters are taking advantage of automobile subscription programs and subscription-based ride-sharing services. In the technology space, companies are opting for software-as-a-service applications over on-premise installations. In manufacturing, sensors and connectivity have allowed companies to bundle an array of digital services with their physical products. Digital subscriptions have had a positive effect on the newspaper and publishing industries, with readers increasingly subscribing to digital news and information sources. In addition, the retail space features a growing multitude of subscription services including clothing and accessories, cosmetics and personal care, meals and groceries, vitamins and prescriptions, pet care, and many more.\nMany of today's enterprise software systems that businesses use to manage their order-to-revenue processes were built for a product driven economy, and are extremely difficult to re-configure for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services. In traditional business models, order-to-revenue was a linear process-a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue recognized. These legacy systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Trying to use this software to build a subscription business frequently results in prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs), and inefficiency.\nThese new subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and produce the data required to close their books and drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate.\nOur mission is to enable all companies in the Subscription Economy to become successful. Our customers include companies of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to some of the world's largest enterprises. Customers pay for our platform under a subscription-based model, and this model allows us to grow as the Subscription Economy grows.\nFiscal 2019 Business Highlights\nKey corporate milestones during fiscal 2019 include:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We completed our IPO in which we sold 12.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to the public at a price of $14.00 per share, netting $159.7 million in cash proceeds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In our third quarter of fiscal 2019, we surpassed 500 customers with ACV exceeding $100,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we crossed $10 billion in quarterly invoice transaction volume that customers run through our system.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a definition of ACV, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operational and Financial Metrics.\u201d\nFiscal 2019 Financial Performance Summary\nOur financial performance in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, reflects the following:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Subscription revenues were $168.8 million, an increase of $48.4 million or 40%, and total revenues were $235.2 million, an increase of $67.3 million or 40%. This growth reflects our acquisition of new customers as well as existing customer retention, increased usage-based fees and sales of new products to our customers. Our growth also reflects the impact of our acquisition of Leeyo in May of 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total cost of revenue was $116.6 million, or 50% of revenue, in fiscal 2019 compared to $79.9 million, or 48% of revenue, in 2018.

During fiscal 2019, we incurred additional costs to grow our business and to support operations as a publicly traded company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Key Operational and Financial Metrics\nWe monitor the following key operational and financial metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of or for the Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000\n</td> <td>526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar-based retention rate\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomers with Annual Contract Value (ACV) Equal to or Greater than $100,000\nWe believe our ability to enter into larger contracts is indicative of broader adoption of our solution by larger organizations. It also reflects our ability to expand our revenue footprint within our current customer base. We define ACV as the subscription revenue we would contractually expect to recognize from that customer over the next twelve months, assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of parties or organizations that have entered into a distinct subscription contract with us for which the term has not ended. Each party with which we have entered into a distinct subscription contract is considered a unique customer, and in some cases, there may be more than one customer within a single organization. We have increased the number of customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000 to 526 as of January 31, 2019, as compared to 415 as of January 31, 2018 and 292 as of January 31, 2017.\nDollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe our dollar-based retention rate is a key measure of our ability to retain and expand revenue from our customer base over time. We calculate our dollar-based retention rate as of a period end by starting with the sum of the ACV from all customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or prior period ACV. We then calculate the sum of the ACV from these same customers as of the current period end, or current period ACV. Current period ACV includes any upsells and also reflects contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new customers added in the current period. We then divide the current period ACV by the prior period ACV to arrive at our dollar-based retention rate. Our dollar-based retention rate increased to 112% as of January 31, 2019, as compared to 110% as of January 31, 2018 and 104% as of January 31, 2017.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue consists of fees for access to, and use of, our products, as well as customer support. We generate subscription fees pursuant to non-cancelable subscription agreements with terms that typically range from one to three years. Subscription revenue is primarily based on fees to access our services platform over the subscription term. We typically invoice customers in advance in either annual or quarterly installments. Customers can also elect to purchase additional volume blocks or products during the term of the contract. We typically recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period, beginning on the date that access to our platform is provided, which is generally on or about the date the subscription agreement is signed.\nProfessional services revenue. Professional services revenue consists of fees for services related to helping our customers deploy, configure, and optimize the use of our solutions. These services include system integration, data migration, process enhancement, and training. Professional services projects generally take three to twelve months to complete. Once the contract is signed, we generally invoice for professional services on a time and materials basis, although we occasionally engage in fixed-price service engagements and invoice for those based upon agreed milestone payments. We recognize revenue as services are performed for time and materials engagements and on a proportional performance method as the services are performed for fixed fee engagements.\nImpact of ASC 606 Adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, and has since modified the standard. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. This new revenue standard became effective for public companies for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that year. Private companies have an additional year to adopt the standard. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, under which ASC 606 is applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 is recognized at the date of initial application.\nWe adopted the requirements of ASC 606, effective February 1, 2019, using the full retrospective transition method. The adoption of the new standard is expected to have an impact on revenue and commissions expense for all periods presented. The primary impacts on revenue are an increased number of allocations of arrangement consideration between subscription and professional services and the recognition of discounts evenly across the term for multiple year subscription arrangements. Both of these impacts are primarily due to the elimination of the contingent revenue rule. We also expect an impact due to a change in the recognition of legacy on-premise term deals inherited during our acquisition of Leeyo Software, Inc., which will require more revenue being recognized at the beginning of the license term as opposed to evenly over the term. In addition to impacting the way that the Company recognizes revenue, the new standard will also impact the accounting for incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. Under the new standard, the Company will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain the contract. The Company expects to amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period of economic benefit which has been determined to be five years.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized from our subscription and support services and professional services arrangements. We primarily invoice our customers for subscription services arrangements annually or quarterly in advance. Amounts anticipated to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred revenue, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOverhead Allocation and Employee Compensation Costs\nWe allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent, utilities, and depreciation on capital expenditures related to facilities shared by multiple departments), information technology costs, and certain administrative personnel costs to all departments based on headcount and location. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expenses category. Employee compensation costs consist of salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of subscription revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our platform and providing customer support. These costs include data center costs and third-party hosting fees, employee compensation costs associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and our customer support organizations, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and purchased technology, allocated overhead, software and maintenance costs, and outside services associated with the delivery of our subscription services. We intend to continue to invest in our platform infrastructure,\nincluding third-party hosting capacity, and support organizations. However, the level and timing of investment in these areas could fluctuate and affect our cost of subscription revenue in the future.\nCost of professional services revenue. Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of costs related to the deployment of our platform. These costs include employee compensation costs for our professional services team, allocated overhead, travel costs, and costs of outside services associated with supplementing our internal staff. Cost of providing professional services, excluding stock-based compensation, has historically been similar to the associated professional services revenue, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.\nGross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates, and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, including through third party cloud providers, our continued efforts to build platform support and professional services teams, as well as the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and acquired technology.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead, and travel costs. We capitalize research and development costs associated with the development of internal-use software and we amortize these costs over a period of approximately two to three years into cost of subscription revenue. All other research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important for our growth, and as such, expect our research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future but may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, including commissions for our sales personnel, allocated overhead, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, and travel costs. We currently expense sales commissions in the period of sale. Effective February 1, 2019 under ASC 606, commissions will be amortized in sales and marketing expense over the period of benefit, which is expected to be five years. While our sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue has decreased in recent periods, we expect to continue to make significant investments as we expand our customer acquisition and retention efforts. Therefore, we expect that sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars but may vary as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead, and travel costs for finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and recruiting personnel. In addition, general and administrative expense includes non-personnel costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees, charitable contributions and all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We incurred additional costs as a result of operating as a public company in fiscal 2019, including costs related to compliance and reporting obligations of public companies, and increased costs for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect many of these costs to continue for the full year of fiscal 2020. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future but decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net primarily consists of interest income from our investment holdings, interest expense associated with our Debt Agreement, and foreign exchange fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations data for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td>

This change was primarily due to taxes incurred by foreign subsidiaries. The material changes in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 within the tax rate reconciliation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements primarily relate to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets which resulted in an increase to the provision and this was included within the change in tax rate line item in the tax rate reconciliation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The Tax Reform Act also impacts the state income tax, net of federal benefit resulting in an increased benefit as compared to the prior year. Additionally, this was offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance. On a total basis, these items resulted in a net impact of zero on the provision.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended January 31, 2019.

subscription revenue increased sequentially in each of the periods presented primarily due to increases in the number of customers as well as sales of blocks of transaction volume and sales of additional products. We have historically entered into more subscription agreements in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, though this seasonality is sometimes not apparent in our subscription revenue because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract. The growth in quarterly professional services revenue in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to our Zuora RevPro product and our customers requiring additional services in connection with their adoption of ASC 606, as well as larger implementations of new Zuora billing customers.\nQuarterly Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Trends\nOur quarterly gross margin from subscription revenue has generally been consistent over the fiscal quarters presented. This reflects our increased investment in data center operations and our support organization.\nOur quarterly gross margin from professional services has generally decreased sequentially, primarily due to continuing investment in headcount and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, in order to support a greater number of\ncustomer deployments. Some of this incremental investment in headcount was not fully utilized during the three months ended January 31, 2019, due to ramp-up time for new hires, and is expected to be realized in future periods.\nQuarterly Operating Expenses Trends\nTotal operating expenses have generally increased sequentially for the fiscal quarters presented, primarily due to the addition of personnel in connection with the expansion of our business.\nOur sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to continued investment in expanding our customer acquisition and retention efforts. The increase in sales and marketing expense beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of our acquisition of Leeyo, which occurred in the quarter ended July 31, 2017. Our sales and marketing expense can also fluctuate between quarters due to the timing of our annual sales kick-off and our annual user conferences, which are typically held in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year, respectively.\nOur research and development expense increased primarily due to continued investment in developing our solutions. The increase in research and development expense beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of our acquisition of Leeyo, which occurred in the quarter ended July 31, 2017.\nOur general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher headcount to support our growth and the additional costs associated with operating as a public company. General and administrative expense included legal fees in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to our acquisition of Leeyo and expenses in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a public company. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we donated $1.0 million of our common stock to a charitable foundation, which increased general and administrative expense by that amount.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $175.8 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities, payments received from customers for subscription and professional services, and borrowings from our Debt Agreement. Additionally, in April 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 12.7 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $159.7 million from the IPO, after underwriting discounts and commissions and payments of offering costs as of January 31, 2019.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, funds available under our Debt Agreement, and cash provided by subscriptions to our platform and related professional services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product offerings, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may elect to or may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Sales of additional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, it could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\nDebt Agreement\nSee Note 9. Debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our Debt Agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(121,123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,685\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>161,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,558\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscription and professional services. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses, third-party consulting expenses, and third-party hosting costs.\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $23.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $77.6 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $38.7 million and net cash inflows of $15.3 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges, which primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts, increased compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of growth in our business operations. Specifically, stock-based compensation increased $16.4 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of new equity grants and enrollments in our ESPP, which was adopted in April 2018. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $24.6 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $12.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as many of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were due to a net increase of $9.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.9 million reflecting the growth in our business and the timing of billings and payments.\nFor fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $24.8 million, which consisted of a net loss of $47.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $18.8 million and net cash inflows of $3.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $21.3 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $21.0 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was due to a decrease of $3.8 million in accounts payable and an increase of $3.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by an increase of $10.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $25.0 million, which consisted of a net loss of $39.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $12.0 million and net cash inflows of $2.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $7.9 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was due to an increase of $3.3 million in accrued employee liabilities partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 was $121.1 million, primarily due to $107.5 million in purchases of short-term investments and $13.4 million in purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 was $16.1 million, primarily due to $11.4 million in cash paid to investors in connection with our acquisition of Leeyo and $4.7 million in purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $3.7 million, primarily due to $3.8 million in purchases of capital equipment and the capitalization of internal-use software.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $161.4 million, primarily due to $164.7 million in net IPO proceeds, $5.3 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under the ESPP, $11.5 million in stock option exercise proceeds and $1.3 million in net proceeds from related party loans, partially offset by $12.6 million in payments to investors related to our acquisition of Leeyo, $4.4 million in deferred offering costs payments, $3.6 million in payments made on leased equipment and $0.8 million of debt payments.\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $15.4 million, primarily the result of $15.0 million drawn down under our Debt Agreement, and $4.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases, offset by payments of $2.1 million related to capital leases, $1.3 million in payments under related party notes receivable, and payments of $0.6 million related to deferred offering costs.\nCash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 of $0.4 million was primarily the result of payments of $2.0 million related to capital leases partially offset by $1.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants, net of repurchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nObligations and Other Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases for office space and our Debt Agreement.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be repaid.\nIn March 2019, we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately 100,000 square feet of office space located in Redwood Shores, California that will replace our existing headquarters in San Mateo, California. See Note 17.\nSubsequent Events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about the lease of our new headquarters.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from two sources: (1) subscription services which is comprised of revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing our cloud-based software and (2) professional services and other revenue which consists primarily of fees from consultation services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration, and training. Subscription services revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the related subscription period beginning on the date the customer is first given access to the system (i.e. provision date). We recognize professional services revenue once the revenue recognition criteria have been met based on a proportional performance method for fixed price engagements or as the service is being provided for time and material-based contracts. In most cases, the customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of our software. However, certain contracts assumed with our acquisition of Leeyo do give the customer the right to install our software on the customer's premises. Certain other Leeyo contracts give the customer the right to receive the source code of our software upon the occurrence of certain events such as our bankruptcy, insolvency, or failure to provide technical support for software. See Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies-Leeyo On-Premise Arrangements\u201d in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the service is being provided to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue from new customers is often generated under subscription agreements with multiple elements, comprised of subscription services fees from customers accessing our software and professional services associated with consultation services. We evaluate each element in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has stand-alone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control. Subscription services have stand-alone value because they are routinely sold separately by us. Professional services have stand-alone value because we have sold professional services separately and there are several third-party vendors that routinely contract directly with the customer and provide these services to the customer on a stand-alone basis.\nFor cloud-based software subscription services revenue and professional services revenue, we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for an element is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available; third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available; or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We determine whether VSOE can be established for elements of our arrangements by reviewing the prices at which such elements are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Through January 31, 2019, we have not established VSOE or TPE for any of the elements of our arrangements. Therefore, we utilize the ESP for all our elements. We establish ESP for both our cloud-based subscription services and professional services elements primarily by considering the actual sales prices of the element when sold on a stand-alone basis or when sold together with other elements. The consideration allocated to subscription services is typically recognized as revenue over the noncancelable contract period on a straight-line basis. The consideration allocated to professional services is typically recognized as revenue once the revenue\nrecognition criteria have been met based on a proportional performance method for fixed price engagements or as the service is being provided for time and material-based contracts.\nAmounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand application service. Sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are reported on a net basis and, therefore, excluded from revenue. We classify reimbursements received from clients for out-of-pocket expenses as professional services revenue as incurred.\nSubscription agreements generally have terms ranging from one to three years and are generally invoiced annually or quarterly in advance over the term. The professional services component of the arrangements is generally earned during the first year of the subscription period depending on the size and complexity of the business utilizing the platform service.\nThe subscription agreements occasionally provide service-level uptime commitments per period, excluding scheduled maintenance. The failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their platform fees. Based on our historical experience of meeting our service-level commitments, we do not currently have any reserves for these commitments.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs related to developing new functionality for our suite of products that are hosted by us and accessed by our customers on a subscription basis. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to internal-use software during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock, and RSUs, to our employees, certain consultants, and certain members of our board of directors. All stock-based compensation, including purchase rights issued under the ESPP, is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. This fair value is recognized as an expense following the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period of the entire award for stock options, RSUs and restricted stock; and over the offering period for the purchase rights issued under the ESPP.\nPrior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant. After the IPO, we used the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of its stock options and the purchase rights under the ESPP. This requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected volatility. We estimate the expected volatility based on the volatility of similar publicly-held entities (referred to as guideline companies\u201d) over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. In evaluating the similarity of guideline companies to us, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar guideline companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our Class A common stock becomes available.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected term. We determine the expected term of awards which contain only service conditions using the simplified approach, in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nexpiration date of the award, as we do not have sufficient historical data relating to stock-option exercises. For awards granted which contain performance conditions, we estimate the expected term based on the estimated dates that the performance conditions will be satisfied.\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted corresponding to the expected term of the awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimated dividend yield. The estimated dividend yield is zero, as we have not declared dividends in the past and do not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected term and estimated forfeiture rate utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nAs we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility, expected term, and estimated forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nWe estimate the fair value of our restricted stock and RSU grants based on the grant date fair value of our common stock. The resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally four years. Estimated forfeitures are based upon our historical experience and we revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31.\nOverview\nBusiness Summary\nZuora is a leading cloud-based subscription management platform. We provide software that enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage or transform to a subscription business model. Architected specifically for dynamic, recurring subscription business models, our cloud-based software functions as an intelligent subscription management hub that automates and orchestrates the entire subscription order-to-revenue process, including billing and revenue recognition. Our solution enables businesses to easily change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, to efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, and to build meaningful relationships with their subscribers.\nWe believe we are in the early stages of a multi-decade global shift away from product-based business models, characterized by transactional one-time sales, towards recurring subscription-based business models. This trend, which we refer to as the Subscription Economy,\u201d is visible everywhere you look. In media and entertainment, consumers are adopting video-on-demand services and digital music streaming services. Commuters are taking advantage of automobile subscription programs and subscription-based ride-sharing services. In the technology space, companies are opting for software-as-a-service applications over on-premise installations. In manufacturing, sensors and connectivity have allowed companies to bundle an array of digital services with their physical products. Digital subscriptions have had a positive effect on the newspaper and publishing industries, with readers increasingly subscribing to digital news and information sources. In addition, the retail space features a growing multitude of subscription services including clothing and accessories, cosmetics and personal care, meals and groceries, vitamins and prescriptions, pet care, and many more.\nMany of today's enterprise software systems that businesses use to manage their order-to-revenue processes were built for a product driven economy, and are extremely difficult to re-configure for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services. In traditional business models, order-to-revenue was a linear process-a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue recognized. These legacy systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Trying to use this software to build a subscription business frequently results in prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs), and inefficiency.\nThese new subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and produce the data required to close their books and drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate.\nOur mission is to enable all companies in the Subscription Economy to become successful. Our customers include companies of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to some of the world's largest enterprises. Customers pay for our platform under a subscription-based model, and this model allows us to grow as the Subscription Economy grows.\nFiscal 2019 Business Highlights\nKey corporate milestones during fiscal 2019 include:\n \u2022 We completed our IPO in which we sold 12.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to the public at a price of $14.00 per share, netting $159.7 million in cash proceeds. \n \u2022 In our third quarter of fiscal 2019, we surpassed 500 customers with ACV exceeding $100,000. \n \u2022 In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we crossed $10 billion in quarterly invoice transaction volume that customers run through our system. \nFor a definition of ACV, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operational and Financial Metrics.\u201d\nFiscal 2019 Financial Performance Summary\nOur financial performance in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, reflects the following:\n \u2022 Subscription revenues were $168.8 million, an increase of $48.4 million or 40%, and total revenues were $235.2 million, an increase of $67.3 million or 40%. This growth reflects our acquisition of new customers as well as existing customer retention, increased usage-based fees and sales of new products to our customers. Our growth also reflects the impact of our acquisition of Leeyo in May of 2017. \n \u2022 Total cost of revenue was $116.6 million, or 50% of revenue, in fiscal 2019 compared to $79.9 million, or 48% of revenue, in 2018. During fiscal 2019, we invested additional resources to support the growth in the number of customers as well as the increase in usage from existing customers. \n \u2022 Loss from operations was $75.8 million, or 32% of revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to a loss of $46.3 million, or 28% of revenue, in 2018. During fiscal 2019, we incurred additional costs to grow our business and to support operations as a publicly traded company.  Key Operational and Financial Metrics\nWe monitor the following key operational and financial metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of or for the Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000\n</td> <td>526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar-based retention rate\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomers with Annual Contract Value (ACV) Equal to or Greater than $100,000\nWe believe our ability to enter into larger contracts is indicative of broader adoption of our solution by larger organizations. It also reflects our ability to expand our revenue footprint within our current customer base. We define ACV as the subscription revenue we would contractually expect to recognize from that customer over the next twelve months, assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of parties or organizations that have entered into a distinct subscription contract with us for which the term has not ended. Each party with which we have entered into a distinct subscription contract is considered a unique customer, and in some cases, there may be more than one customer within a single organization. We have increased the number of customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000 to 526 as of January 31, 2019, as compared to 415 as of January 31, 2018 and 292 as of January 31, 2017.\nDollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe our dollar-based retention rate is a key measure of our ability to retain and expand revenue from our customer base over time. We calculate our dollar-based retention rate as of a period end by starting with the sum of the ACV from all customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or prior period ACV. We then calculate the sum of the ACV from these same customers as of the current period end, or current period ACV. Current period ACV includes any upsells and also reflects contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new customers added in the current period. We then divide the current period ACV by the prior period ACV to arrive at our dollar-based retention rate. Our dollar-based retention rate increased to 112% as of January 31, 2019, as compared to 110% as of January 31, 2018 and 104% as of January 31, 2017.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue consists of fees for access to, and use of, our products, as well as customer support. We generate subscription fees pursuant to non-cancelable subscription agreements with terms that typically range from one to three years. Subscription revenue is primarily based on fees to access our services platform over the subscription term. We typically invoice customers in advance in either annual or quarterly installments. Customers can also elect to purchase additional volume blocks or products during the term of the contract. We typically recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period, beginning on the date that access to our platform is provided, which is generally on or about the date the subscription agreement is signed.\nProfessional services revenue. Professional services revenue consists of fees for services related to helping our customers deploy, configure, and optimize the use of our solutions. These services include system integration, data migration, process enhancement, and training. Professional services projects generally take three to twelve months to complete. Once the contract is signed, we generally invoice for professional services on a time and materials basis, although we occasionally engage in fixed-price service engagements and invoice for those based upon agreed milestone payments. We recognize revenue as services are performed for time and materials engagements and on a proportional performance method as the services are performed for fixed fee engagements.\nImpact of ASC 606 Adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, and has since modified the standard. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. This new revenue standard became effective for public companies for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that year. Private companies have an additional year to adopt the standard. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, under which ASC 606 is applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 is recognized at the date of initial application.\nWe adopted the requirements of ASC 606, effective February 1, 2019, using the full retrospective transition method. The adoption of the new standard is expected to have an impact on revenue and commissions expense for all periods presented. The primary impacts on revenue are an increased number of allocations of arrangement consideration between subscription and professional services and the recognition of discounts evenly across the term for multiple year subscription arrangements. Both of these impacts are primarily due to the elimination of the contingent revenue rule. We also expect an impact due to a change in the recognition of legacy on-premise term deals inherited during our acquisition of Leeyo Software, Inc., which will require more revenue being recognized at the beginning of the license term as opposed to evenly over the term. In addition to impacting the way that the Company recognizes revenue, the new standard will also impact the accounting for incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. Under the new standard, the Company will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain the contract. The Company expects to amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period of economic benefit which has been determined to be five years.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized from our subscription and support services and professional services arrangements. We primarily invoice our customers for subscription services arrangements annually or quarterly in advance. Amounts anticipated to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred revenue, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOverhead Allocation and Employee Compensation Costs\nWe allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent, utilities, and depreciation on capital expenditures related to facilities shared by multiple departments), information technology costs, and certain administrative personnel costs to all departments based on headcount and location. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expenses category. Employee compensation costs consist of salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of subscription revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our platform and providing customer support. These costs include data center costs and third-party hosting fees, employee compensation costs associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and our customer support organizations, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and purchased technology, allocated overhead, software and maintenance costs, and outside services associated with the delivery of our subscription services. We intend to continue to invest in our platform infrastructure,\nincluding third-party hosting capacity, and support organizations. However, the level and timing of investment in these areas could fluctuate and affect our cost of subscription revenue in the future.\nCost of professional services revenue. Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of costs related to the deployment of our platform. These costs include employee compensation costs for our professional services team, allocated overhead, travel costs, and costs of outside services associated with supplementing our internal staff. Cost of providing professional services, excluding stock-based compensation, has historically been similar to the associated professional services revenue, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.\nGross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates, and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, including through third party cloud providers, our continued efforts to build platform support and professional services teams, as well as the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and acquired technology.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead, and travel costs. We capitalize research and development costs associated with the development of internal-use software and we amortize these costs over a period of approximately two to three years into cost of subscription revenue. All other research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important for our growth, and as such, expect our research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future but may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, including commissions for our sales personnel, allocated overhead, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, and travel costs. We currently expense sales commissions in the period of sale. Effective February 1, 2019 under ASC 606, commissions will be amortized in sales and marketing expense over the period of benefit, which is expected to be five years. While our sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue has decreased in recent periods, we expect to continue to make significant investments as we expand our customer acquisition and retention efforts. Therefore, we expect that sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars but may vary as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead, and travel costs for finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and recruiting personnel. In addition, general and administrative expense includes non-personnel costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees, charitable contributions and all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We incurred additional costs as a result of operating as a public company in fiscal 2019, including costs related to compliance and reporting obligations of public companies, and increased costs for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect many of these costs to continue for the full year of fiscal 2020. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future but decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net primarily consists of interest income from our investment holdings, interest expense associated with our Debt Agreement, and foreign exchange fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations data for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td>

This change was primarily due to taxes incurred by foreign subsidiaries. The material changes in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 within the tax rate reconciliation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements primarily relate to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets which resulted in an increase to the provision and this was included within the change in tax rate line item in the tax rate reconciliation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The Tax Reform Act also impacts the state income tax, net of federal benefit resulting in an increased benefit as compared to the prior year. Additionally, this was offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance. On a total basis, these items resulted in a net impact of zero on the provision.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended January 31, 2019.

rounding.\nQuarterly Revenue Trends\nOur quarterly subscription revenue increased sequentially in each of the periods presented primarily due to increases in the number of customers as well as sales of blocks of transaction volume and sales of additional products. We have historically entered into more subscription agreements in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, though this seasonality is sometimes not apparent in our subscription revenue because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract. The growth in quarterly professional services revenue in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to our Zuora RevPro product and our customers requiring additional services in connection with their adoption of ASC 606, as well as larger implementations of new Zuora billing customers.\nQuarterly Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Trends\nOur quarterly gross margin from subscription revenue has generally been consistent over the fiscal quarters presented. This reflects our increased investment in data center operations and our support organization.\nOur quarterly gross margin from professional services has generally decreased sequentially, primarily due to continuing investment in headcount and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, in order to support a greater number of\ncustomer deployments. Some of this incremental investment in headcount was not fully utilized during the three months ended January 31, 2019, due to ramp-up time for new hires, and is expected to be realized in future periods.\nQuarterly Operating Expenses Trends\nTotal operating expenses have generally increased sequentially for the fiscal quarters presented, primarily due to the addition of personnel in connection with the expansion of our business.\nOur sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to continued investment in expanding our customer acquisition and retention efforts. The increase in sales and marketing expense beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of our acquisition of Leeyo, which occurred in the quarter ended July 31, 2017. Our sales and marketing expense can also fluctuate between quarters due to the timing of our annual sales kick-off and our annual user conferences, which are typically held in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year, respectively.\nOur research and development expense increased primarily due to continued investment in developing our solutions. The increase in research and development expense beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of our acquisition of Leeyo, which occurred in the quarter ended July 31, 2017.\nOur general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher headcount to support our growth and the additional costs associated with operating as a public company. General and administrative expense included legal fees in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to our acquisition of Leeyo and expenses in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a public company. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we donated $1.0 million of our common stock to a charitable foundation, which increased general and administrative expense by that amount.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $175.8 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities, payments received from customers for subscription and professional services, and borrowings from our Debt Agreement. Additionally, in April 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 12.7 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $159.7 million from the IPO, after underwriting discounts and commissions and payments of offering costs as of January 31, 2019.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, funds available under our Debt Agreement, and cash provided by subscriptions to our platform and related professional services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product offerings, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may elect to or may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Sales of additional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, it could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\nDebt Agreement\nSee Note 9.

Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses, third-party consulting expenses, and third-party hosting costs.\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $23.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $77.6 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $38.7 million and net cash inflows of $15.3 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges, which primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts, increased compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of growth in our business operations. Specifically, stock-based compensation increased $16.4 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of new equity grants and enrollments in our ESPP, which was adopted in April 2018. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $24.6 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $12.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as many of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were due to a net increase of $9.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.9 million reflecting the growth in our business and the timing of billings and payments.\nFor fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $24.8 million, which consisted of a net loss of $47.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $18.8 million and net cash inflows of $3.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $21.3 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $21.0 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was due to a decrease of $3.8 million in accounts payable and an increase of $3.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by an increase of $10.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $25.0 million, which consisted of a net loss of $39.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $12.0 million and net cash inflows of $2.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $7.9 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was due to an increase of $3.3 million in accrued employee liabilities partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 was $121.1 million, primarily due to $107.5 million in purchases of short-term investments and $13.4 million in purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 was $16.1 million, primarily due to $11.4 million in cash paid to investors in connection with our acquisition of Leeyo and $4.7 million in purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $3.7 million, primarily due to $3.8 million in purchases of capital equipment and the capitalization of internal-use software.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $161.4 million, primarily due to $164.7 million in net IPO proceeds, $5.3 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under the ESPP, $11.5 million in stock option exercise proceeds and $1.3 million in net proceeds from related party loans, partially offset by $12.6 million in payments to investors related to our acquisition of Leeyo, $4.4 million in deferred offering costs payments, $3.6 million in payments made on leased equipment and $0.8 million of debt payments.\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $15.4 million, primarily the result of $15.0 million drawn down under our Debt Agreement, and $4.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases, offset by payments of $2.1 million related to capital leases, $1.3 million in payments under related party notes receivable, and payments of $0.6 million related to deferred offering costs.\nCash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 of $0.4 million was primarily the result of payments of $2.0 million related to capital leases partially offset by $1.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants, net of repurchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nObligations and Other Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases for office space and our Debt Agreement. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt principal and interest2\n</td> <td>14,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual obligations3\n</td> <td>3,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________\n (1) We lease our facilities under long-term operating leases which expire on varying dates through April 2024. The lease agreements often contain provisions which require us to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. \n (2) Debt principal and interest includes amounts owed under our Debt Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank including principal, interest and a $0.2 million facility fee on the term loan. Interest payments were calculated using the applicable rate as of January 31, 2019. See Note 9. Debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our Debt Agreement. \n (3) As of January 31, 2019, our only other material contractual obligation was to purchase $4.0 million in web hosting services from one of our vendors by September 30, 2019.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from data breaches or intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be repaid.\nIn March 2019, we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately 100,000 square feet of office space located in Redwood Shores, California that will replace our existing headquarters in San Mateo, California. See Note 17.\nSubsequent Events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about the lease of our new headquarters.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from two sources: (1) subscription services which is comprised of revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing our cloud-based software and (2) professional services and other revenue which consists primarily of fees from consultation services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration, and training. Subscription services revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the related subscription period beginning on the date the customer is first given access to the system (i.e. provision date). We recognize professional services revenue once the revenue recognition criteria have been met based on a proportional performance method for fixed price engagements or as the service is being provided for time and material-based contracts. In most cases, the customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of our software. However, certain contracts assumed with our acquisition of Leeyo do give the customer the right to install our software on the customer's premises. Certain other Leeyo contracts give the customer the right to receive the source code of our software upon the occurrence of certain events such as our bankruptcy, insolvency, or failure to provide technical support for software. See Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies-Leeyo On-Premise Arrangements\u201d in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:\n \u2022 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n \u2022 the service is being provided to the customer; \n \u2022 the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and \n \u2022 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.  Revenue from new customers is often generated under subscription agreements with multiple elements, comprised of subscription services fees from customers accessing our software and professional services associated with consultation services. We evaluate each element in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has stand-alone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control. Subscription services have stand-alone value because they are routinely sold separately by us. Professional services have stand-alone value because we have sold professional services separately and there are several third-party vendors that routinely contract directly with the customer and provide these services to the customer on a stand-alone basis.\nFor cloud-based software subscription services revenue and professional services revenue, we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for an element is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available; third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available; or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We determine whether VSOE can be established for elements of our arrangements by reviewing the prices at which such elements are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Through January 31, 2019, we have not established VSOE or TPE for any of the elements of our arrangements. Therefore, we utilize the ESP for all our elements. We establish ESP for both our cloud-based subscription services and professional services elements primarily by considering the actual sales prices of the element when sold on a stand-alone basis or when sold together with other elements. The consideration allocated to subscription services is typically recognized as revenue over the noncancelable contract period on a straight-line basis. The consideration allocated to professional services is typically recognized as revenue once the revenue\nrecognition criteria have been met based on a proportional performance method for fixed price engagements or as the service is being provided for time and material-based contracts.\nAmounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand application service. Sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are reported on a net basis and, therefore, excluded from revenue. We classify reimbursements received from clients for out-of-pocket expenses as professional services revenue as incurred.\nSubscription agreements generally have terms ranging from one to three years and are generally invoiced annually or quarterly in advance over the term. The professional services component of the arrangements is generally earned during the first year of the subscription period depending on the size and complexity of the business utilizing the platform service.\nThe subscription agreements occasionally provide service-level uptime commitments per period, excluding scheduled maintenance. The failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their platform fees. Based on our historical experience of meeting our service-level commitments, we do not currently have any reserves for these commitments.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs related to developing new functionality for our suite of products that are hosted by us and accessed by our customers on a subscription basis. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to internal-use software during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock, and RSUs, to our employees, certain consultants, and certain members of our board of directors. All stock-based compensation, including purchase rights issued under the ESPP, is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. This fair value is recognized as an expense following the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period of the entire award for stock options, RSUs and restricted stock; and over the offering period for the purchase rights issued under the ESPP.\nPrior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant. After the IPO, we used the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of its stock options and the purchase rights under the ESPP. This requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n \u2022 Expected volatility. We estimate the expected volatility based on the volatility of similar publicly-held entities (referred to as guideline companies\u201d) over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. In evaluating the similarity of guideline companies to us, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar guideline companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our Class A common stock becomes available. \n \u2022 Expected term. We determine the expected term of awards which contain only service conditions using the simplified approach, in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the \nexpiration date of the award, as we do not have sufficient historical data relating to stock-option exercises. For awards granted which contain performance conditions, we estimate the expected term based on the estimated dates that the performance conditions will be satisfied.\n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted corresponding to the expected term of the awards. \n \u2022 Estimated dividend yield. The estimated dividend yield is zero, as we have not declared dividends in the past and do not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.  In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected term and estimated forfeiture rate utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nAs we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility, expected term, and estimated forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nWe estimate the fair value of our restricted stock and RSU grants based on the grant date fair value of our common stock. The resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally four years. Estimated forfeitures are based upon our historical experience and we revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31.\nOverview\nBusiness Summary\nZuora is a leading cloud-based subscription management platform. We provide software that enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage or transform to a subscription business model. Architected specifically for dynamic, recurring subscription business models, our cloud-based software functions as an intelligent subscription management hub that automates and orchestrates the entire subscription order-to-revenue process, including billing and revenue recognition. Our solution enables businesses to easily change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, to efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, and to build meaningful relationships with their subscribers.\nWe believe we are in the early stages of a multi-decade global shift away from product-based business models, characterized by transactional one-time sales, towards recurring subscription-based business models. This trend, which we refer to as the Subscription Economy,\u201d is visible everywhere you look. In media and entertainment, consumers are adopting video-on-demand services and digital music streaming services. Commuters are taking advantage of automobile subscription programs and subscription-based ride-sharing services. In the technology space, companies are opting for software-as-a-service applications over on-premise installations. In manufacturing, sensors and connectivity have allowed companies to bundle an array of digital services with their physical products. Digital subscriptions have had a positive effect on the newspaper and publishing industries, with readers increasingly subscribing to digital news and information sources. In addition, the retail space features a growing multitude of subscription services including clothing and accessories, cosmetics and personal care, meals and groceries, vitamins and prescriptions, pet care, and many more.\nMany of today's enterprise software systems that businesses use to manage their order-to-revenue processes were built for a product driven economy, and are extremely difficult to re-configure for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services. In traditional business models, order-to-revenue was a linear process-a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue recognized. These legacy systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Trying to use this software to build a subscription business frequently results in prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs), and inefficiency.\nThese new subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and produce the data required to close their books and drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate.\nOur mission is to enable all companies in the Subscription Economy to become successful. Our customers include companies of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to some of the world's largest enterprises. Customers pay for our platform under a subscription-based model, and this model allows us to grow as the Subscription Economy grows.\nFiscal 2019 Business Highlights\nKey corporate milestones during fiscal 2019 include:\n \u2022 We completed our IPO in which we sold 12.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to the public at a price of $14.00 per share, netting $159.7 million in cash proceeds. \n \u2022 In our third quarter of fiscal 2019, we surpassed 500 customers with ACV exceeding $100,000. \n \u2022 In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we crossed $10 billion in quarterly invoice transaction volume that customers run through our system. \nFor a definition of ACV, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operational and Financial Metrics.\u201d\nFiscal 2019 Financial Performance Summary\nOur financial performance in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, reflects the following:\n \u2022 Subscription revenues were $168.8 million, an increase of $48.4 million or 40%, and total revenues were $235.2 million, an increase of $67.3 million or 40%. This growth reflects our acquisition of new customers as well as existing customer retention, increased usage-based fees and sales of new products to our customers. Our growth also reflects the impact of our acquisition of Leeyo in May of 2017. \n \u2022 Total cost of revenue was $116.6 million, or 50% of revenue, in fiscal 2019 compared to $79.9 million, or 48% of revenue, in 2018. During fiscal 2019, we invested additional resources to support the growth in the number of customers as well as the increase in usage from existing customers. \n \u2022 Loss from operations was $75.8 million, or 32% of revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to a loss of $46.3 million, or 28% of revenue, in 2018. During fiscal 2019, we incurred additional costs to grow our business and to support operations as a publicly traded company.  Key Operational and Financial Metrics\nWe monitor the following key operational and financial metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions:\n\nCustomers with Annual Contract Value (ACV) Equal to or Greater than $100,000\nWe believe our ability to enter into larger contracts is indicative of broader adoption of our solution by larger organizations. It also reflects our ability to expand our revenue footprint within our current customer base. We define ACV as the subscription revenue we would contractually expect to recognize from that customer over the next twelve months, assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of parties or organizations that have entered into a distinct subscription contract with us for which the term has not ended. Each party with which we have entered into a distinct subscription contract is considered a unique customer, and in some cases, there may be more than one customer within a single organization. We have increased the number of customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000 to 526 as of January 31, 2019, as compared to 415 as of January 31, 2018 and 292 as of January 31, 2017.\nDollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe our dollar-based retention rate is a key measure of our ability to retain and expand revenue from our customer base over time. We calculate our dollar-based retention rate as of a period end by starting with the sum of the ACV from all customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or prior period ACV. We then calculate the sum of the ACV from these same customers as of the current period end, or current period ACV. Current period ACV includes any upsells and also reflects contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new customers added in the current period. We then divide the current period ACV by the prior period ACV to arrive at our dollar-based retention rate. Our dollar-based retention rate increased to 112% as of January 31, 2019, as compared to 110% as of January 31, 2018 and 104% as of January 31, 2017.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue consists of fees for access to, and use of, our products, as well as customer support. We generate subscription fees pursuant to non-cancelable subscription agreements with terms that typically range from one to three years. Subscription revenue is primarily based on fees to access our services platform over the subscription term. We typically invoice customers in advance in either annual or quarterly installments. Customers can also elect to purchase additional volume blocks or products during the term of the contract. We typically recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period, beginning on the date that access to our platform is provided, which is generally on or about the date the subscription agreement is signed.\nProfessional services revenue. Professional services revenue consists of fees for services related to helping our customers deploy, configure, and optimize the use of our solutions. These services include system integration, data migration, process enhancement, and training. Professional services projects generally take three to twelve months to complete. Once the contract is signed, we generally invoice for professional services on a time and materials basis, although we occasionally engage in fixed-price service engagements and invoice for those based upon agreed milestone payments. We recognize revenue as services are performed for time and materials engagements and on a proportional performance method as the services are performed for fixed fee engagements.\nImpact of ASC 606 Adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, and has since modified the standard. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. This new revenue standard became effective for public companies for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that year. Private companies have an additional year to adopt the standard. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, under which ASC 606 is applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 is recognized at the date of initial application.\nWe adopted the requirements of ASC 606, effective February 1, 2019, using the full retrospective transition method. The adoption of the new standard is expected to have an impact on revenue and commissions expense for all periods presented. The primary impacts on revenue are an increased number of allocations of arrangement consideration between subscription and professional services and the recognition of discounts evenly across the term for multiple year subscription arrangements. Both of these impacts are primarily due to the elimination of the contingent revenue rule. We also expect an impact due to a change in the recognition of legacy on-premise term deals inherited during our acquisition of Leeyo Software, Inc., which will require more revenue being recognized at the beginning of the license term as opposed to evenly over the term. In addition to impacting the way that the Company recognizes revenue, the new standard will also impact the accounting for incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. Under the new standard, the Company will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain the contract. The Company expects to amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period of economic benefit which has been determined to be five years.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized from our subscription and support services and professional services arrangements. We primarily invoice our customers for subscription services arrangements annually or quarterly in advance. Amounts anticipated to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred revenue, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOverhead Allocation and Employee Compensation Costs\nWe allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent, utilities, and depreciation on capital expenditures related to facilities shared by multiple departments), information technology costs, and certain administrative personnel costs to all departments based on headcount and location. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expenses category. Employee compensation costs consist of salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of subscription revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our platform and providing customer support. These costs include data center costs and third-party hosting fees, employee compensation costs associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and our customer support organizations, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and purchased technology, allocated overhead, software and maintenance costs, and outside services associated with the delivery of our subscription services. We intend to continue to invest in our platform infrastructure,\nincluding third-party hosting capacity, and support organizations. However, the level and timing of investment in these areas could fluctuate and affect our cost of subscription revenue in the future.\nCost of professional services revenue. Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of costs related to the deployment of our platform. These costs include employee compensation costs for our professional services team, allocated overhead, travel costs, and costs of outside services associated with supplementing our internal staff. Cost of providing professional services, excluding stock-based compensation, has historically been similar to the associated professional services revenue, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.\nGross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates, and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, including through third party cloud providers, our continued efforts to build platform support and professional services teams, as well as the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and acquired technology.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead, and travel costs. We capitalize research and development costs associated with the development of internal-use software and we amortize these costs over a period of approximately two to three years into cost of subscription revenue. All other research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important for our growth, and as such, expect our research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future but may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, including commissions for our sales personnel, allocated overhead, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, and travel costs. We currently expense sales commissions in the period of sale. Effective February 1, 2019 under ASC 606, commissions will be amortized in sales and marketing expense over the period of benefit, which is expected to be five years. While our sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue has decreased in recent periods, we expect to continue to make significant investments as we expand our customer acquisition and retention efforts. Therefore, we expect that sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars but may vary as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead, and travel costs for finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and recruiting personnel. In addition, general and administrative expense includes non-personnel costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees, charitable contributions and all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We incurred additional costs as a result of operating as a public company in fiscal 2019, including costs related to compliance and reporting obligations of public companies, and increased costs for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect many of these costs to continue for the full year of fiscal 2020. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future but decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net primarily consists of interest income from our investment holdings, interest expense associated with our Debt Agreement, and foreign exchange fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations data for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue:\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\n\nNote: Percentages in the table above may not sum due to rounding.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue \nSubscription revenue increased by $48.4 million, or 40%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily attributable to new customers acquired during the period and an increase in usage and sales of additional products to our existing customers. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of Leeyo in May 2017, we recognized more subscription revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to the impact of purchase accounting from the acquisition and recognizing a full year of revenue from Zuora RevPro.\nProfessional services revenue increased by $18.8 million, or 40%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to increased revenue from customer deployments of our products.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nCost of subscription revenue increased by $11.9 million, or 38%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase of $4.4 million in data center costs, $3.4 million in employee compensation costs related to increased headcount, $1.6 million of professional services, $1.1 million in software license costs, $1.0 million in allocated overhead including facilities expansions, and $0.3 million related to the amortization of purchased technology and amortization of internal-use software. The increase in these costs is driven by the growth in the number of customers as well as the increase in usage from existing customers.\nCost of professional services revenue increased by $24.8 million, or 51%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase of $16.6 million in employee compensation costs related to increased headcount, $4.4 million in allocated overhead including facilities expansions, $1.7 million in professional services, $1.7 million in travel costs, and $0.3 million in software license costs.\nOur gross margin for subscription services improved to 75% for fiscal 2019 from 74% for fiscal 2018 as a result of the impact of purchase accounting from the acquisition of Leeyo that resulted in higher subscription revenue recognition relative to costs for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.\nOur gross margin for professional services decreased to (11)% for fiscal 2019 compared to (3)% for fiscal 2018, primarily from the increase in deployment capacity. Some of this incremental investment in headcount was not fully utilized during fiscal 2019 due to ramp-up time for new hires, and is expected to be realized in future periods.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $15.8 million, or 41%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase of $12.0 million in employee compensation costs due to increased headcount, $2.3 million in allocated overhead including facilities expansions, $0.8 million in professional services, $0.7 million in travel costs, $0.6 million in data center costs, and $0.4 million in software license costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in costs related to higher capitalized internal-use software costs. The increase in headcount was driven by our continued investment in technology, innovation, and new products.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expense increased by $27.7 million, or 38%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in employee compensation costs related to increased headcount, $4.0 million in allocated overhead including facilities expansions, $3.4 million in marketing and event costs and $2.6 million in travel costs. The increase in headcount was driven by our continued investment to acquire new customers and to grow our revenue from existing customers.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $16.7 million, or 74%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase of $7.3 million in employee compensation costs related to increased headcount, $3.8 million in professional services primarily related to accounting, tax and legal costs, $2.0 million in allocated overhead including facilities expansions, $1.0 million in donations of our Class A common stock to a charitable foundation, $1.0 million in software license costs, $1.0 million in other administrative costs and $0.4 million in travel costs. The increase in these costs was primarily driven by investment required to support our growth as well as operations as a public company.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\n\nInterest and other income (expense), net decreased by $0.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, due to an increase of $2.6 million in net losses related to revaluing cash, accounts receivable and payables recorded in a foreign currency, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in net interest income as a result of invested cash balances and an increase of $0.6 million from accretion on short-term investments.\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. For fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 we recorded a tax provision of $1.4 million and $1.1 million on losses before income taxes of $76.2 million and $46.0 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was (1.8)% and (2.5)%, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily as a result of providing no benefit on pretax losses incurred in the United States. For fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we maintained a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue\n\nSubscription revenue increased by $30.5 million, or 34%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Approximately 29% of the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal 2018 was attributable to new customers acquired during the period, and the remainder was attributable to an increase in usage and sales of additional products to our existing customers. Subscription revenue for fiscal 2017 did not include revenue attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nProfessional services revenue increased by $24.4 million, or 105%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to fiscal 2017 not including professional services revenue attributable to our Zuora RevPro product and higher revenue from customer deployments compared to fiscal 2017.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nCost of subscription revenue increased by $8.2 million, or 36%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase of $2.5 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, an increase of $2.4 million in third-party data center costs, an increase of $2.0 million related to the amortization of purchased technology and amortization of internal-use software, an increase of $0.6 million in software license costs, and an increase of $0.4 million in allocated overhead. Cost of subscription revenue for fiscal 2017 did not include costs attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nOur gross margin for subscription revenue decreased from 75% for fiscal 2017 to 74% for fiscal 2018 due to investments in international markets and the impact of our Zuora RevPro product, partially offset by higher efficiencies from greater scale.\nCost of professional services revenue increased by $23.5 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, due to a greater number of customer deployments. Cost of professional services for fiscal 2017 did not include costs attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nOur gross margin for professional services revenue increased from (9%) for fiscal 2017 to (3%) for fiscal 2018, primarily attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $12.3 million, or 47%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase of $7.4 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead, an increase of $1.1 million in costs due to lower capitalized internal-use software costs in 2018, an increase of $0.6 million in data center costs, and an increase of $0.4 million in travel costs. Research and development expense for fiscal 2017 did not include costs attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expense increased by $10.7 million, or 17%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase of $9.2 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, an increase of $0.7 million in allocated overhead costs, an increase of $0.4 million in travel costs, and an increase of $0.4 million in marketing and event costs. Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 did not include costs attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $7.4 million, or 49%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase of $4.0 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, an increase of $2.6 million in professional services, comprised primarily of legal, accounting, and consulting fees, an increase of $0.5 million in allocated overhead costs, and an increase of $0.3 million in software licenses. General and administrative expense for fiscal 2017 did not include costs attributable to our Zuora RevPro product.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest and other income (expense), net increased by $33,000 for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.5 million in currency translation gains resulting from foreign operations, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in interest expense related to the term loan facility under our Debt Agreement, which we drew down on in June 2017.\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nOur provision for income tax increased $0.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to taxes on foreign income.\nOur effective tax rate decreased from (0.7)% in fiscal 2017 to (2.5)% in fiscal 2018. This change was primarily due to taxes incurred by foreign subsidiaries. The material changes in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 within the tax rate reconciliation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements primarily relate to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets which resulted in an increase to the provision and this was included within the change in tax rate line item in the tax rate reconciliation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The Tax Reform Act also impacts the state income tax, net of federal benefit resulting in an increased benefit as compared to the prior year. Additionally, this was offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance. On a total basis, these items resulted in a net impact of zero on the provision.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended January 31, 2019. The unaudited consolidated statement of operations data set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that are necessary for the fair presentation of such data. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year or any other period. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing:\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated results of operations data for each of the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nNote: Percentages in the table above may not sum due to rounding.\nQuarterly Revenue Trends\nOur quarterly subscription revenue increased sequentially in each of the periods presented primarily due to increases in the number of customers as well as sales of blocks of transaction volume and sales of additional products. We have historically entered into more subscription agreements in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, though this seasonality is sometimes not apparent in our subscription revenue because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract. The growth in quarterly professional services revenue in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to our Zuora RevPro product and our customers requiring additional services in connection with their adoption of ASC 606, as well as larger implementations of new Zuora billing customers.\nQuarterly Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Trends\nOur quarterly gross margin from subscription revenue has generally been consistent over the fiscal quarters presented. This reflects our increased investment in data center operations and our support organization.\nOur quarterly gross margin from professional services has generally decreased sequentially, primarily due to continuing investment in headcount and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, in order to support a greater number of\ncustomer deployments. Some of this incremental investment in headcount was not fully utilized during the three months ended January 31, 2019, due to ramp-up time for new hires, and is expected to be realized in future periods.\nQuarterly Operating Expenses Trends\nTotal operating expenses have generally increased sequentially for the fiscal quarters presented, primarily due to the addition of personnel in connection with the expansion of our business.\nOur sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to continued investment in expanding our customer acquisition and retention efforts. The increase in sales and marketing expense beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of our acquisition of Leeyo, which occurred in the quarter ended July 31, 2017. Our sales and marketing expense can also fluctuate between quarters due to the timing of our annual sales kick-off and our annual user conferences, which are typically held in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year, respectively.\nOur research and development expense increased primarily due to continued investment in developing our solutions. The increase in research and development expense beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of our acquisition of Leeyo, which occurred in the quarter ended July 31, 2017.\nOur general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher headcount to support our growth and the additional costs associated with operating as a public company. General and administrative expense included legal fees in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to our acquisition of Leeyo and expenses in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a public company. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we donated $1.0 million of our common stock to a charitable foundation, which increased general and administrative expense by that amount.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $175.8 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities, payments received from customers for subscription and professional services, and borrowings from our Debt Agreement. Additionally, in April 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 12.7 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $159.7 million from the IPO, after underwriting discounts and commissions and payments of offering costs as of January 31, 2019.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, funds available under our Debt Agreement, and cash provided by subscriptions to our platform and related professional services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product offerings, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may elect to or may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Sales of additional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, it could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\nDebt Agreement\nSee Note 9. Debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our Debt Agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscription and professional services. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses, third-party consulting expenses, and third-party hosting costs.\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $23.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $77.6 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $38.7 million and net cash inflows of $15.3 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges, which primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts, increased compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of growth in our business operations. Specifically, stock-based compensation increased $16.4 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of new equity grants and enrollments in our ESPP, which was adopted in April 2018. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $24.6 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $12.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as many of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were due to a net increase of $9.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.9 million reflecting the growth in our business and the timing of billings and payments.\nFor fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $24.8 million, which consisted of a net loss of $47.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $18.8 million and net cash inflows of $3.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $21.3 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $21.0 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was due to a decrease of $3.8 million in accounts payable and an increase of $3.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by an increase of $10.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $25.0 million, which consisted of a net loss of $39.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $12.0 million and net cash inflows of $2.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $7.9 million increase in deferred revenue, offset by a $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable, net, resulting primarily from increased subscription arrangements as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance for annual subscriptions. Additionally, the change in operating assets and liabilities was due to an increase of $3.3 million in accrued employee liabilities partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 was $121.1 million, primarily due to $107.5 million in purchases of short-term investments and $13.4 million in purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 was $16.1 million, primarily due to $11.4 million in cash paid to investors in connection with our acquisition of Leeyo and $4.7 million in purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $3.7 million, primarily due to $3.8 million in purchases of capital equipment and the capitalization of internal-use software.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $161.4 million, primarily due to $164.7 million in net IPO proceeds, $5.3 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under the ESPP, $11.5 million in stock option exercise proceeds and $1.3 million in net proceeds from related party loans, partially offset by $12.6 million in payments to investors related to our acquisition of Leeyo, $4.4 million in deferred offering costs payments, $3.6 million in payments made on leased equipment and $0.8 million of debt payments.\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $15.4 million, primarily the result of $15.0 million drawn down under our Debt Agreement, and $4.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases, offset by payments of $2.1 million related to capital leases, $1.3 million in payments under related party notes receivable, and payments of $0.6 million related to deferred offering costs.\nCash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 of $0.4 million was primarily the result of payments of $2.0 million related to capital leases partially offset by $1.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants, net of repurchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nObligations and Other Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases for office space and our Debt Agreement. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\n_________________________________\n (1) We lease our facilities under long-term operating leases which expire on varying dates through April 2024. The lease agreements often contain provisions which require us to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. \n (2) Debt principal and interest includes amounts owed under our Debt Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank including principal, interest and a $0.2 million facility fee on the term loan. Interest payments were calculated using the applicable rate as of January 31, 2019. See Note 9. Debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our Debt Agreement. \n (3) As of January 31, 2019, our only other material contractual obligation was to purchase $4.0 million in web hosting services from one of our vendors by September 30, 2019.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from data breaches or intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be repaid.\nIn March 2019, we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately 100,000 square feet of office space located in Redwood Shores, California that will replace our existing headquarters in San Mateo, California. See Note 17.\nSubsequent Events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about the lease of our new headquarters.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from two sources: (1) subscription services which is comprised of revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing our cloud-based software and (2) professional services and other revenue which consists primarily of fees from consultation services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration, and training. Subscription services revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the related subscription period beginning on the date the customer is first given access to the system (i.e. provision date). We recognize professional services revenue once the revenue recognition criteria have been met based on a proportional performance method for fixed price engagements or as the service is being provided for time and material-based contracts. In most cases, the customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of our software. However, certain contracts assumed with our acquisition of Leeyo do give the customer the right to install our software on the customer's premises. Certain other Leeyo contracts give the customer the right to receive the source code of our software upon the occurrence of certain events such as our bankruptcy, insolvency, or failure to provide technical support for software. See Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies-Leeyo On-Premise Arrangements\u201d in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:\n \u2022 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n \u2022 the service is being provided to the customer; \n \u2022 the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and \n \u2022 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.  Revenue from new customers is often generated under subscription agreements with multiple elements, comprised of subscription services fees from customers accessing our software and professional services associated with consultation services. We evaluate each element in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has stand-alone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control. Subscription services have stand-alone value because they are routinely sold separately by us. Professional services have stand-alone value because we have sold professional services separately and there are several third-party vendors that routinely contract directly with the customer and provide these services to the customer on a stand-alone basis.\nFor cloud-based software subscription services revenue and professional services revenue, we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for an element is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available; third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available; or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We determine whether VSOE can be established for elements of our arrangements by reviewing the prices at which such elements are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Through January 31, 2019, we have not established VSOE or TPE for any of the elements of our arrangements. Therefore, we utilize the ESP for all our elements. We establish ESP for both our cloud-based subscription services and professional services elements primarily by considering the actual sales prices of the element when sold on a stand-alone basis or when sold together with other elements. The consideration allocated to subscription services is typically recognized as revenue over the noncancelable contract period on a straight-line basis. The consideration allocated to professional services is typically recognized as revenue once the revenue\nrecognition criteria have been met based on a proportional performance method for fixed price engagements or as the service is being provided for time and material-based contracts.\nAmounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand application service. Sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are reported on a net basis and, therefore, excluded from revenue. We classify reimbursements received from clients for out-of-pocket expenses as professional services revenue as incurred.\nSubscription agreements generally have terms ranging from one to three years and are generally invoiced annually or quarterly in advance over the term. The professional services component of the arrangements is generally earned during the first year of the subscription period depending on the size and complexity of the business utilizing the platform service.\nThe subscription agreements occasionally provide service-level uptime commitments per period, excluding scheduled maintenance. The failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their platform fees. Based on our historical experience of meeting our service-level commitments, we do not currently have any reserves for these commitments.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs related to developing new functionality for our suite of products that are hosted by us and accessed by our customers on a subscription basis. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to internal-use software during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock, and RSUs, to our employees, certain consultants, and certain members of our board of directors. All stock-based compensation, including purchase rights issued under the ESPP, is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. This fair value is recognized as an expense following the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period of the entire award for stock options, RSUs and restricted stock; and over the offering period for the purchase rights issued under the ESPP.\nPrior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant. After the IPO, we used the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of its stock options and the purchase rights under the ESPP. This requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n \u2022 Expected volatility. We estimate the expected volatility based on the volatility of similar publicly-held entities (referred to as guideline companies\u201d) over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. In evaluating the similarity of guideline companies to us, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar guideline companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our Class A common stock becomes available. \n \u2022 Expected term. We determine the expected term of awards which contain only service conditions using the simplified approach, in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the \nexpiration date of the award, as we do not have sufficient historical data relating to stock-option exercises. For awards granted which contain performance conditions, we estimate the expected term based on the estimated dates that the performance conditions will be satisfied.\n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted corresponding to the expected term of the awards. \n \u2022 Estimated dividend yield. The estimated dividend yield is zero, as we have not declared dividends in the past and do not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.  In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected term and estimated forfeiture rate utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nAs we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility, expected term, and estimated forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nWe estimate the fair value of our restricted stock and RSU grants based on the grant date fair value of our common stock. The resulting fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally four years. Estimated forfeitures are based upon our historical experience and we revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2.
