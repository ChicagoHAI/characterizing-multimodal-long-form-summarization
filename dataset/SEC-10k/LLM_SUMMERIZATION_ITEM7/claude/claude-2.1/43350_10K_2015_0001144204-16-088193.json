Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future performance. However, future performance involves risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a natural gas company, primarily operating local distribution companies in four states and serving approximately 67,800 customers in total. Our natural gas utility subsidiaries are Bangor Gas Company (Maine), Brainard Gas Corp. (Ohio), Cut Bank Gas Company (Montana), Energy West Montana (Montana), Frontier Natural Gas (North Carolina), Northeast Ohio Natural Gas Corporation (Ohio) and Orwell Natural Gas Company (Ohio). Each of these entities is regulated in their respective states and operates under tariffs which allow them to collect revenue sufficient to recover their operating costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their rate base. Approximately 93%, 93% and 89%, of our revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were derived from our natural gas utility operations.\nOur operations also include the marketing and production of natural gas. Our marketing and production subsidiaries are Energy West Resources (Montana and Wyoming) and Gas Natural Resources (Ohio). Our marketing and production subsidiaries obtain gas from interstate pipelines, local producers, and from small production wells in which it owns an interest. This gas is then sold to regulated utilities, commercial and industrial customers that are the end users of the commodity. In 2015, our marketing and production subsidiaries marketed approximately 1.5 Bcf of natural gas in three states.\nAs part of this discussion and analysis of our operating results we refer to increases and decreases in heating degree days. A heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit. In any given period, sales volumes reflect the impact of weather, in addition to other factors. We do not have a weather normalization adjustment in our rates and as a result, our revenue is sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Colder temperatures generally result in increased sales, while warmer temperatures generally result in reduced sales.\nWe recorded gains on our discontinued operations during 2015 related to the sale of EWW of $4,869 and the sale of the Pipeline Assets of $499. The following summarizes the critical events that impacted our results of continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2015:\nGross margin decreased due to:\nTable 79: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the executed stipulation with the PUCO Staff in the second quarter of 2015, which related to the most recent gas cost recovery audits in Ohio and specified a disallowance of gas costs of $693 over amounts previously accrued, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the lower sales volumes in our Montana market caused lower gross margin in 2015, compared to 2014, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation in our North Carolina market were adjusted downward $234 in 2015, compared to 2014, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>an adjustment to deferred gas costs in our Clarion River and Walker Gas divisions in Ohio lowered gross margin by $184 in the third quarter of 2015, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>a partially offsetting increase in gross margin in our Maine market due to the activation of the Loring pipeline and the higher sales volumes in 2015, compared to 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses increased as a result of the following:\nTable 84: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increases related to personnel costs of $764, legal fees of $675, depreciation, amortization and accretion of $600, and property taxes of $192 in 2015 compared to 2014, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>we incurred operating expenses related to the implementation of our new ERP system, including general and administrative expense of $606, maintenance expense of $265 depreciation of $163 and interest expense of $237, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $834 in 2015 compared to 2014, offsetting the increases in operating expenses listed above.

As a result solely of changes in gas prices, our revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in sales volumes or gross margin. We consider gross margin to be a better measure of comparative performance than revenues. However, gas prices and revenues can impact our working capital requirements; see \"Operating Cash Flow\" below.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements. We analyze our estimates, including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process. Our regulated natural gas segment continues to be cost-of-service rate regulated, and we believe the application of ASC 980 - Regulated Operations to that segment continues to be appropriate. We must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date. If, as a result of a change in circumstances, we determine that the regulated natural gas segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under ASC 980, that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities.\nThe application of ASC 980 results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before we have received approval for recovery from the state regulatory agencies. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base this conclusion on certain factors, including changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies, and the status of any potential new legislation. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers. At December 31, 2015, our total regulatory assets were $3,992 and our total regulatory liabilities were $1,738. A write-off of our regulatory assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur natural gas segment contains regulated utility businesses in the states of Maine, Montana, North Carolina and Ohio, and the regulation varies from state to state. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, we would be required to charge these assets to current earnings. However, there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets. In addition, deregulation would be a change that occurs over time, due to legal processes and procedures, which could moderate the impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nA significant regulatory asset/liability relates to the recoverable/refundable costs of gas purchases. We account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies, under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes.\nOur gas cost recoveries are monitored closely by the regulatory commissions in all of the states in which we operate. The gas cost recoveries are adjusted monthly in three of the four states in which we operate, and semi-annually in the other one. In addition, all of the states in which we operate require us to submit gas procurement plans, which we closely follow. These plans are reviewed annually by each of the regulatory commissions. The adjustment of gas cost recoveries and the gas procurement plans reduce the risk of disallowance of recoverable gas costs. Based on our experience, we believe it is highly probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory commissions, however, can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccumulated Provisions for Doubtful Accounts\nWe encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable. As such, we record a provision for those accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, we primarily utilize current conditions as well as historical bad debt write-offs as a percentage of aged receivables. The underlying assumptions used for the provision can change from period to period and the provision could potentially cause a material impact to our financial statements by overstating liquidity and over-valuing net worth. The actual weather, commodity prices, and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact our operating income.\nUnbilled Revenue and Gas Costs\nWe estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each meter reading cycle to the month end. This estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period. Unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end.\nEach month we record the estimated unbilled revenue amounts as revenue and a receivable, and we reverse the prior month's estimate. Likewise, we record associated gas costs as cost of revenue and a payable, and we reverse prior month's estimate. Actual price and usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact revenues recognized and costs recorded. The critical component of calculating unbilled revenue is estimating the usage on a calendar month basis. Our estimated volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation have varied from our actual monthly metered volumes by less than plus or minus 10% on December 31, 2015 and 2014. A 10% change in our unbilled revenue at December 31, 2015, would have impacted our gross margin by $177.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair values of marketable securities are estimated based on the closing share price on the quoted market price for those investments. The fair values of our derivative instruments are estimated based on the difference between the fixed commodity price designated in the agreement and the commodity futures price for the settlement period at the measurement date. The fair value measure of our contingent consideration liability has significant unobservable inputs, including our weighted average cost of capital, our credit spread above the risk free rate and our forecasted future cash flows. A significant increase (decrease) in these inputs could result in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value measure.\nDeferred Tax Asset and Income Tax Accruals\nJudgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes, regulations, and income tax examinations require that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process.\nWe have a deferred tax asset of approximately $5,700 as of December 31, 2015, related to the carryover tax basis of Frontier Utilities and Penobscot Natural Gas, which we acquired in 2007. The carryover tax basis is subject to the limitations in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limited our tax depreciation in tax years 2007 through 2012. We have approximately $14,676 of carryover tax basis remaining as of December 31, 2015, and will recognize potential future federal and state income tax benefits of approximately $5,700 over the remaining life of the carryover tax basis of the assets. For federal income tax purposes, we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will be realized in future reporting periods based on future taxable income projections. For state income tax purposes, we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will not be realized, due to state net operating loss carryovers and future state taxable income projections. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $1,564 on the state deferred tax assets associated with the carryover tax basis of our subsidiaries acquired in 2007.\nManagement reevaluates the valuation allowance annually based on future taxable income projections and adjusts our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets. If the projections indicate that we are unable to use all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, we will adjust the valuation allowance to income tax expense. Our valuation allowance is based on projections of our taxable income in future reporting years. Based on future taxable income projections, our state net operating losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $4,913 on our state deferred tax asset associated with state net operating losses.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the federal tax portion, the five year Internal Revenue Code limitation period discussed above expired in 2012. Based on our estimates of taxable income, we project that we will recover approximately 98% of the remaining benefit in the next eight years, with 2% recovered in small increments in the remaining years. Based on this analysis, we believe that a valuation allowance on the federal portion of the benefit is not necessary. Failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a write-down in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected and could also lead to the expiration of the deferred tax asset between now and 2029, either of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, rather, the goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, which we perform in the fourth quarter, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We test for goodwill impairment using a two-step approach. A recoverability test at the reporting unit level must be performed during the first step. If the asset is not recoverable, the second step calculates the impairment loss, if any. Our impairment evaluations as of December 31, 2015, indicated that our goodwill is fully recoverable. During 2015, we sold the assets of our PGC subsidiary and recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $284 based on the carrying value of our assets and our estimated costs to sell the assets, which is included in the computation of our loss on the sale of PGC. See Note 6- Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nThe schedule below shows the goodwill balances allocated to our Ohio and GNR subsidiaries as well as the excess of their fair values over their carrying values as of December 31, 2015, if any:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Enterprise </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect on enterprise fair value of: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Enterprise </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% increase in weighted </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% decline in </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Unit </td> <td> </td> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>average cost of capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>residual growth rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ohio subsidiaries </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,450 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,400 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>GNR subsidiary </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cut Bank subsidiary </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is a degree of uncertainty related to assumptions used to determine fair value. There are estimates and assumptions for organic growth, market equity risk, realized return on equity investments, market multiples, risk premium for size, weighted average cost of capital, capital structure, and tax rate. Weather can negatively impact our key assumptions and results.\nWhen testing goodwill impairment of our subsidiaries, the enterprise value calculations were determined by putting an equal emphasis on a discounted cash flow method and a guideline public company method. The key assumptions made for each approach used in the impairment testing were (1) weighted average cost of capital of 7.0-13.5%; (2) perpetuity growth rate of 2.5%; and (3) operating EBITDA forecasts. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from these impairment tests.\nLease Commitments\nEach time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects whether and how the transaction is reflected in our balance sheet, as well as our recognition of rental payments as rent or interest expense. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and residual value of leased properties, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows that may be realized from the leased properties. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. Other aspects of our lease accounting policies relate to the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions, including the appropriate amortization any deferred gains or losses. Our lease accounting policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations and estimated useful lives. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not known at the time of our previous assessments, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties that we lease, result in a change in classification of some of our leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>

in the Natural Gas Operations segment, and the results of our pipeline operations segment have also been classified as discontinued operations as a result of a sale agreement executed on October 10, 2014. In addition, the 2015 and 2014 results of our propane operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the assets of Independence in November 2013. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail. Our income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 was $3,519 or $0.34 per share, compared to $1,033 or $0.10 per share for 2014. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2015 primarily consisted of a net gain recorded on the sale of EWW of $4,869 and the net gain for the sale of the Pipeline Assets of $499.\nIncome from continuing operations - Income from continuing operations for 2015 was $1,169, or $0.11 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $2,729 or $0.26 per share for 2014. Income from continuing operations decreased by $1,560 primarily due to: 1) increases in personnel related costs of $764 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor; 2) increased legal fees of $675 related to our ongoing legal matters; 3) increases in our expenses related to the implementation of our new ERP system, including operating expenses of $871, depreciation of $163 and interest expense of $237; 4) a charge of $693 in the second quarter of 2015 for additional disallowed gas cost beyond amounts accrued from the stipulation with the PUCO Staff in the most recent gas cost recovery audit in Ohio; and 5) an offsetting increase to revenues from the Loring pipeline, customer growth and colder weather in our Maine market. Loss from our gas marketing and production operations decreased by $1,320, primarily as a result of a decrease in bad debt expense of $834 during 2015 because during the 2014 period because our marketing operation in Montana wrote-off $1,056 of uncollectible receivables resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, we experienced a decrease of $1,131 in our income tax expenses based on our income before taxes, which declined for the reasons listed above. Loss from our corporate and other segment decreased by $136, primarily as a result of a decrease in our operating expenses of $534 that occurred because distribution, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our EWW subsidiary were reallocated to corporate in 2014 when we reclassified that subsidiary as discontinued operations.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - Revenues decreased by $20,209 to $112,361 during 2015 compared to $132,570 during 2014. Revenue from natural gas operations decreased by $19,075 due primarily to: 1) a decrease in the price of natural gas passed through to our customers in our Ohio, North Carolina and Montana markets; 2) decreased sales volumes due to warmer weather in our Montana market; 3) a decrease of $534 related to a downward adjustment to volumes used to calculate unbilled revenue in our North Carolina market in 2015, and partially offset by; 4) increases in revenue in Maine of $1,775 and $527 for transportation services to customers and the Loring pipeline, respectively. Our Loring pipeline began transportation services in September 2014. Revenue from our marketing and production operation decreased by $1,134 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition and significantly lower prices for volumes produced in our production operation.\nGross margin - Gross margin decreased by $617 to $44,235 for 2015 compared to $44,852 for 2014. Our natural gas operation's margins decreased $358, due primarily to: 1) a charge of $693 recorded in the second quarter of 2015 for additional disallowed gas cost beyond amounts accrued from the PUCO Staff stipulation in the gas cost recovery audit in Ohio; 2) lower sales in our Montana market due to warmer weather; 3) volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation in our North Carolina market were adjusted downward $234 in 2015, compared to 2014, and partially offset by; 4) increased margin from the Loring pipeline and customer growth and colder weather in our Maine market. Gross margin from our marketing & production operations decreased $259, primarily due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition and the lower prices for volumes produced in our production operation.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses increased by $1,474 to $39,227 for 2015 compared to $37,753 for the same period in 2014. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased $1,456 primarily due an increases in personnel related costs of $764 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor, and we experienced increased legal fees of $675. Additionally, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $248 for training related to our new ERP system and we recorded amortization of a deferred loss on the sale-leaseback transaction for our ERP system of $358. These increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease of $824 in other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $600 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $245 related to our regulatory asset in Frontier and as a result of an increase of $163 related to our ERP system assets placed in service during 2015. Taxes other than income increased by $192 due to property tax increases. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased $834 during 2015 because during the 2014 period, our marketing operation in Montana wrote-off $1,056 of uncollectible receivables resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nOther income (expense) - Other income (expense) decreased by $222 to $182 for 2015 compared to $404 for 2014. During 2015, changes in other income were the result of: 1) a net loss on the disposals of our Clarion, Walker, PGC and 8500 Station Street assets of $335; 2) a decrease in rental income of $156; 3) a decrease of approximately $132 in management fee income that we earned for operating natural gas facilities for third parties, and; 4) a decrease in interest income of $150 due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market in 2014 that did not recur in 2015. These decreases in other income (expense) were partially offset by a charge in 2014 to impair our investment in Kykuit, which did not recur in 2015, and as a result in unrealized gains on our commodity swap contracts.\nInterest expense - The following table presents changes in our interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our interest expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the completion and implementation of our build-to-suit ERP system and the related capital lease payments, and as a result of debt issue costs related to our short term loans with NIL Funding.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest related to current borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest related to long-term notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest related to capital leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt issue costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense decreased by $1,131 to $417 for 2015 compared to $1,548 for 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in our income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% for 2015 compared to 39.3% for 2014 as a result of a change in the proportion of our pre-tax income by state.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td>

Revenues increased by $23,170 to $132,570 for 2014 compared to $109,400 for 2013. In our natural gas operation segment, the $25,820 increase was attributable to 1) colder weather in the majority of the markets we serve leading to a higher consumption of natural gas, 2) higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers of our regulated subsidiaries, and 3) growth in our customer base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $2,650 from our marketing and production segment. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $4,778 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in April 2014. Revenue from our western marketing operations decreased by $293 due to lower sales volumes. Offsetting these is the increase in revenue from our GNR subsidiary of $2,341 representing a full year of operations and the revenue increase from our production operation of $80.\nGross margin - Gross margin increased by $1,482 to $44,852 for 2014 compared to $43,370 for 2013. Our natural gas operations segment's margin increased $2,700 due to increased sales volumes from continued customer growth in Maine, North Carolina and Ohio, amplified by colder weather in all of our markets. Gross margin from our marketing and production segment decreased $1,218 primarily due to higher costs of natural gas used to supply fixed price sales contracts, the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline completion, and the loss of NEO and Orwell as customers. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses increased by $6,135 to $37,753 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $31,618 for the prior year period. Distribution, general and administrative expense increased by $3,462 due to 1) increased legal fees of $1,868 stemming primarily from the legal proceedings discussed in Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report; 2) an increase of $569 in consulting and auditing fees related to improving and testing our internal control environment; 3) increases in corporate payroll and benefits of $564; and 4) the write-off of $336 of construction work in progress relating to a software conversion project that has been terminated. Depreciation expense increased by $1,048 due to higher capital expenditures and the amortization of the regulatory asset by Frontier of $245. Taxes other than income increased by $255 primarily due to higher property, payroll and other taxes in our Ohio subsidiaries. The 2014 period included $1,056 in the provision for doubtful accounts resulting from a ruling against us in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Receivables in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail. The 2014 period included a net unrealized holding loss of $62 related to the earn-out provision in the JDOG Marketing purchase, compared to a net unrealized holding gain of $1,565 in 2013. These increases were partially offset by a $726 impairment to goodwill in the 2013 period.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense) - Other income (expense) increased by $104 to $404 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $300 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $184 gain on the sale of marketable securities, a decrease in acquisition expense of $265 year over year, a decrease of $309 in S-3 costs and an increase in interest income of $172. This was partially offset by a $350 loss related to the impairment of our Kykuit investment and a $151 loss on derivative assets.\nInterest expense - Interest expense increased $50 to $3,226 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $3,176 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This change was primarily due to an increase of $4,410 in the average outstanding principle balances on our line of credit that is almost entirely offset by a decrease of $2,472 in the average outstanding principle balances on our notes payable and a decrease in average LIBOR, the basis for our floating interest rates, during the year.\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense decreased by $1,476 to $1,548 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3,024 for the same period in 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income from continuing operations. In addition, the 2014 and 2013 periods each included a tax benefit from the true-up to the prior year's tax return of $71 and $103, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 39.3% for 2014 and 37.5% for 2013. The 2013 period included a tax benefit of $336 related to a change in the state effective tax rates as discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax - The 2014 and 2013 results of our EWW subsidiary, pipeline operations segment, and propane operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding this topic.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td>

This decrease was offset by an increase of $1,775 for transportation services to customers and an increase in revenue of $527 from the Loring pipeline, which began transportation services in September 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas purchases decreased by $18,717 to $60,380 for 2015, compared to $79,097 for 2014. This decrease is primarily due to lower gas costs passed through to customers in our Ohio, North Carolina and Montana markets as well as decreases in sales volumes in our Montana markets. In addition to lower gas costs, the following items impacted our 2015 gas purchases: 1) in the second quarter of 2015, we recorded $693 for additional disallowed gas costs over amounts previously accrued from the PUCO Staff stipulation in the gas cost recovery audit in Ohio, and 2) in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a $184 adjustment to gas costs in our Clarion River and Walker Gas divisions. Our gas costs are passed on dollar for dollar to our customers under tariffs regulated by the various commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gas costs are subject to periodic audits and prudency reviews in all of these jurisdictions.\nGross margin decreased by $358 to $43,598 for 2015 compared to $43,956 for 2014. Gross margin in our Ohio market decreased by $546, as a result of an adjustment for $693 of additional disallowed gas cost in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin in our Montana markets decreased by $352 due to lower sales volumes caused by warmer weather. Gross margin in our North Carolina market decreased by $442 due to the $234 adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 to decrease the lower volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation and as a result of lower sales volumes noted above. Kentucky decreased gross margin by $179. Partially offsetting these, gross margin in our Maine market increased by $1,161 due to the startup of the Loring pipeline and more favorable pricing arrangements.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings\nThe natural gas operations segment's net income for 2015 was $3,476 or $0.33 per share, compared to earnings of $6,492, or $0.62 per share for 2014.\nOperating expenses increased by $3,672 to $35,746 for 2015 compared to $32,074 for 2014. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased by $2,576 due to: 1) increases in personnel related expenses of $1,029 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor; and 2) increases in expenses of $248 for training related to our new ERP system and we recorded amortization of a deferred loss on the sale-leaseback transaction for our ERP system of $354. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $699, of which $245 was a result of increased amortization of a regulatory asset at Frontier and $161 was a result of our ERP system placed in service during 2015. Taxes other than income increased by $206 due to increased property taxes. Increases in our depreciation and property taxes are a result of additions to our plant, property and equipment during 2014 and 2015.\nOther income decreased by $743 to $147 for 2015 compared to $890 for 2014. We experienced a decrease in rental income of $156, a decrease of approximately $132 in management fee income that we earned for operating natural gas facilities for third parties, and interest income decreased by $150 due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $1,920 to $1,741 for 2015 compared to $3,661 for 2014, primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income in 2015 compared to the 2014 period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013\nHeating Degree Days\nA heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent (Warmer) Colder </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 Compared to </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Normal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Normal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Great Falls, MT </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bangor, ME </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Elkin, NC </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Youngstown, OH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Jackson, KY </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues increased by $25,820 to $123,053 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $97,233 for the same period in 2013.

The increase in the volumes from customer growth was offset by the loss of a large customer in our Maine market in the last half of 2014.

The increase is due to higher prices for natural gas in 2014 compared to 2013 combined with the higher volume throughput for our full service distribution customers. Related to the in-progress PUCO audit of our gas cost recovery mechanisms in Ohio, included in the 2014 results is a true-up of $(301) to the accrual contained in the 2013 disallowance amount, offset by additional disallowed gas costs in 2014 of $987 for a net charge of $686. Included in the 2013 results is a charge of $1,502 for the disallowance of gas costs resulting from a previous gas cost recovery audit by the PUCO.\nGross margin increased by $2,700 to $43,956 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $41,256 for the same period in 2013 due to customer growth in our Maine, North Carolina and Ohio markets and colder weather in all of our service territories. Ohio accounted for $2,188 of the increase, Maine and North Carolina for $862, and Kentucky for $131. These increases in margin were offset partially by a decrease in margin in our Montana natural gas operations of $481.\nEarnings\nThe natural gas operations segment's income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $6,492, or $0.62 per share, compared to $6,821, or $0.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOperating expenses increased by $2,681 to $32,074 for 2014, compared to $29,393 for 2013. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,326 due primarily to the increases in allocations of corporate expenses related to the hiring of new corporate personnel and to improving and auditing our internal control environment. Depreciation expense increased $989 due to the increased capital expenditures and the amortization of the regulatory asset in Frontier of $245. Other taxes increased $279 due primarily to increased property and payroll taxes in our Ohio subsidiaries.\nOther income increased by $123 to $890 for 2014 compared to $767 for 2013. Interest income increased by $176 primarily due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market. Gains on disposal of property decreased $39 for 2014 compared to 2013. Income from service sales in 2014 decreased by $62 compared to 2013. Additionally, we had no acquisition related costs in 2014, compared to $47 related to the purchase of an office building asset in 2013.\nInterest expense increased by $53 to $2,619 for 2014 compared to $2,566 for 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased borrowing on the line of credit resulting in $134 of additional interest expense and $51 of increased interest expense related to the change in estimate of the recoverable purchased gas costs in our Ohio markets. Partially offsetting these increases, the payoff of the senior secured guaranteed floating rate note on May 3, 2014, resulted in $83 less interest. In addition, decreased principal balances on our debt and capital lease obligation resulted in $15 and $38 less interest, respectively, compared to 2013.\nIncome tax expense increased by $418 to $3,661 for 2014 compared to $3,243 for 2013 due primarily to the increase in pre-tax income. Both 2014 and 2013 included a true-up of the prior year's tax return for a benefit of $75 and $95, respectively. The 2013 period included a tax benefit related to a change in the state effective tax rates as discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketing & Production\nIncome Statement\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and production </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,167 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas purchased </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,114 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(177 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,582 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) before interest and taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,084 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(135 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(142 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,205 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax benefit (expense) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(586 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(113 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,433 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,036 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues decreased by $1,134 to $8,383 for 2015 compared to $9,517 for 2014.

Loss from our corporate and other segment from continuing operations decreased by $136, primarily as a result of a decrease in our operating expenses of $534 that occurred because distribution, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our EWW subsidiary were reallocated to corporate in 2014 when we reclassified that subsidiary as discontinued operations.\nResults of our corporate and other segment for the year ended December 31, 2014, include administrative costs of $3,201, interest expense of $486, a gain on marketable securities of $184, acquisition related costs of $7, corporate expenses of $171, offset by an income tax benefit of $1,341, and interest and other income of $10, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,330, or $0.22 per share.\nResults of corporate and other operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, include administrative costs of $1,724, acquisition related costs of $225, costs related to expenses for our former chief executive officer's stock sale of $309, corporate expenses of $98, interest expense of $468, offset by an income tax benefit of $805, and interest and other income of $14, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,005, or $0.21 per share.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the sale of our Independence subsidiary in 2013 and the sale of our EWW subsidiary and Glacier & Shoshone pipelines in 2015, the results of the operations for these items have been reclassified to discontinued operations in our corporate and other operating segment. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding these sales.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn the ordinary course of operations, we incur expenses for natural gas purchases, general and administrative expenses, and pipeline construction purchases from companies owned or controlled by Richard M.

For more information, see Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding all of our related party transactions.\nCapital Sources and Liquidity\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our operating and financing expenses and to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are:\nTable 122: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our cash balance; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our operating cash flow; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our revolving credit facility; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our potential to borrow from related parties, as further described below under the heading Financing Cash Flow\u201d; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our potential to issue debt and equity securities; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our potential to finance or sell assets we own. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are:\nTable 128: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our ability to refinance our credit facility that matures in April 2017; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>decreased demand for our natural gas as a result of competition in our markets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the negative impact on our working capital requirements of volatile natural gas prices and the potential for natural gas prices to increase; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>decreased demand for natural gas used for heating as a result of warmer than average temperatures; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>decreased demand for natural gas used for heating as a result of increased energy efficiency in new homes and appliances. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOperating activities provide our primary source of cash and are supplemented by our revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $2,728 and $1,586 of cash on hand, respectively. The results of our EWW and Independence subsidiaries and Glacier & Shoshone pipeline operations are presented separately as discontinued operations. We do not expect the disposition of these subsidiaries and assets to have a material negative impact on our liquidity.\nOur ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), which had a balance of $15,750 and $28,761 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the balance of our revolving line of credit is primarily a result of our cash proceeds from the sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, as well as decreased capital expenditures in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nDuring 2015, we entered into two short term loan agreements with NIL Funding. On October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments to NIL Funding and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity. We made a principal payment of $1,000 on the note during December 2015. On April 6, 2015, we entered into a $5,000 loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding that had a maturity date of October 3, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished. NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nWe made capital expenditures of $9,567, $21,613 and $23,517 for 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively. We finance our capital expenditures by the use of our operating cash flow and our Bank of America revolving line of credit. Long-term debt was $39,721 and $40,263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including the amounts due within one year.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash Flows from Continuing Operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,195 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,679 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,192 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,303 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,003 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,485 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase (decrease) in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,536 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(511 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(590 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash provided by operating activities was $9,424, $11,146 and $15,439 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in the price of natural gas and lower sales volumes, which caused a $6,482 decrease in cash outflows from accounts payable as a result of less accounts payable outstanding at the end of 2015, compared to 2014, partially offset by a $2,184 increase in cash received from accounts receivable and $1,697 increase in cash received from natural gas and propane inventory as a result of lower balances outstanding at the end of 2015, compared to 2014. Major items affecting operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 include: a decrease in income from continuing operations of $3,123, a $2,977 increase in our net regulatory assets and liabilities, a $2,528 decrease in unbilled revenue, a $1,458 increase in payments of other liabilities, a $1,296 increase in accounts receivable collections, a $1,294 increase in accounts payable payments, and a $1,100 increase in prepayments.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $4,195, $18,679 and $20,192 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The changes in our cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by our cash used for capital expenditures and partially offset by cash provided by contributions in aid of construction.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures totaled $9,567, $21,613 and $23,517 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of our capital spending is focused on the growth of our natural gas operations segment. We conduct ongoing construction activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion, maintenance, and enhancement of our gas pipeline systems. We are actively expanding our systems in North Carolina and Maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service in those service areas. Capital expenditures for 2015 and 2014 included $1,482 and $948 in capital expenditures related to our new ERP system that were not financed under a lease agreement. Additionally, in 2013 we purchased an office building in Mentor, Ohio for $1,853, which amount is included in our capital expenditures.\nThe table below presents our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and provides our estimate of cash requirements for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing & production </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate & other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,517 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have budgeted for $4,707 of capital expenditures in 2016 in our natural gas operations segment, which will primarily focus on the continued expansion of our natural gas utilities service areas. These expenditures will have an emphasis on our Maine, North Carolina and Ohio markets.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nCash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $19,303 and $5,003, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities was $12,485 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Major items affecting financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 include: a net increase of $17,242 in the repayment of our line of credit, a net increase in borrowings from notes payable of $4,921, and an increase of $1,667 in payments of capital lease obligations. Major items affecting financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 include: a $16,721 decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common shares, a $3,561 net increase in proceeds from the line of credit, a $2,830 net increase in the repayment of our notes payable, a $653 increase in payments of dividends, and $617 decrease in the release of restricted cash balances.\nHistorically, to the extent that cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our expenditure requirements, including costs of gas purchased and capital expenditures, we have used our revolving line of credit. In general, our short-term borrowing needs for purchases of gas inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short-term borrowing needs for financing customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months. The cash flow from our business is seasonal and the line of credit balance in December normally represents the high point of borrowings in our annual cash flow cycle. Generally, our cash flow increases and our borrowings decrease, beginning in January, as monthly heating bills are paid and the gas we paid for and placed in storage in the summer months is used to supply our customers. Our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, which had a balance of $15,750 and $28,761 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, we had a short-term note payable with a principal balance of $2,000 with NIL Funding. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short term borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, was 2.95%, 2.45%, and 2.42%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on our current borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 2.71% and 2.44%, respectively. We periodically repay our short-term borrowings under the Bank of America revolving line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long-term debt and equity securities. Long-term debt was $39,721 and $40,263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including the amounts due within one year.\nBank of America Credit Agreement and Line of Credit\nOur Energy West subsidiary has a credit facility with the Bank of America ( Credit Facility\u201d) that provides for a revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of $30,000, due April 1, 2017. On November 26, 2014, we entered into an amendment temporarily increasing the borrowing capacity by $10,000 to a maximum of $40,000 until July 1, 2015, and the additional capacity was repaid prior to that date. The MPSC restricted draws on the line of credit to only Energy West and its subsidiary companies. This revolving credit facility includes an annual commitment fee ranging from 25 to 45 basis points of the unused portion of the facility and accrues interest based on our option of two indices - a base rate, which is defined as a daily rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or the daily LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, or LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points. At December 31, 2015, we did not have any base rate borrowings.\nOur average borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $19,838 and $23,397, respectively. The maximum borrowings were $30,911 and $31,061 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which balances occurred during the first and fourth quarters of the year, respectively. The minimum borrowings were $15,750 and $19,061 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which balances occurred during the third and second quarters of the year, respectively. Total borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $15,750 and $28,761, and bore interest at a weighted average outstanding rate of 2.17% and 2.44%, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. After considering outstanding letters of credit of $155, a total of $14,095 was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, Energy West has a $10,000 term loan with Bank of America with a maturity date of April 1, 2017 (the \"Term Loan\"). The Term Loan portion of the Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points and contains an interest rate swap provision that allows for the interest rate to be fixed in the future, but we have not exercised that provision. The Term Loan amortizes at a rate of $125 per quarter. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Term Loan bore interest at 2.17%, and had a balance of $8,375 and $8,875, respectively.\nThe Bank of America revolving credit agreement and term loan contain various covenants, which include limitations on total dividends and distributions, limitations on investments in other entities, maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios, and restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined below.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe credit facility restricts Energy West's ability to pay dividends and make distributions, redemptions and repurchases of stock during the preceding 60-month period to 80% of its net income over that period. In addition, no event of default may exist at the time such dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase is made.\nThe credit facility limits investments in another entity by acquisition of any debt or equity securities or assets or by making loans or advances to such entity. Energy West is also prohibited from consummating a merger or consolidation or selling all or substantially all of its assets or stock except for (i) any merger, consolidation or sale by or with certain of its subsidiaries, (ii) any such purchase or other acquisition by Energy West or certain of its subsidiaries and (iii) sales and dispositions of assets for at least fair market value so long as the net book value of all assets sold or otherwise disposed of in any fiscal year does not exceed 5% of the net book value of Energy West's assets as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year.\nEnergy West must maintain a total debt-to-capital ratio of not more than .55-to-1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.0-to-1.0. The credit facility restricted Energy West's ability to create, incur or assume indebtedness except (i) indebtedness under the credit facility (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases including the capital lease related to the Loring pipeline, and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500, (iii) certain indebtedness of Energy West's subsidiaries, (iv) certain subordinated indebtedness, (v) certain hedging obligations and (vi) other indebtedness not to exceed $1,000.\nNIL Funding\nOn October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. The note bears interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and matures on April 20, 2016. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments to NIL Funding and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity. We made a principal payment of $1,000 on the note during December 2015. Our loan agreement with NIL Funding restricts our ability to incur additional borrowings, make new investments, consummate a merger or acquisition and dispose of assets. In an event of default, as defined under the loan agreement, NIL Funding may, at its option, require us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the note as well as any and all interest and other payments due or convert any part of the amounts due and unpaid to shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 95% of the previous day's closing price on the NYSE MKT. NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nOn April 6, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding. Pursuant to the note and loan agreement, NIL Funding loaned Gas Natural $5,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 7.5%, and a maturity date of October 3, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished.\nSenior Unsecured Notes of Energy West\nOn June 29, 2007, Energy West authorized the sale of $13,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.16% Senior Unsecured Notes with Allstate/CUNA, due June 29, 2017. In connection with our sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to repay the portion of notes payable to Allstate/CUNA that was allocated to EWW and EWD on February 12, 2016, including a prepayment penalty of $310. Additionally, we wrote off the unamortized debt issue costs that were allocated to EWW and EWD's portion of the debt, totaling $103. These amounts were recognized within discontinued operations, net of tax on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our discontinued operations.\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes contain various covenants, which include limitations on Energy West's total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined below, maintenance of certain interest coverage ratios, and limitations on asset sales as outlined below.\nThe credit facility limits Energy West's total dividends and distributions made in the immediately preceding 60-month period to 100% of aggregate consolidated net income for such period.\nThe notes restrict Energy West from incurring additional senior indebtedness in excess of 65% of capitalization at any time.\nThe credit facility also requires Energy West to maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than 150% of the pro forma annual interest charges on a consolidated basis in two of the three preceding fiscal years.\nEnergy West is prohibited from selling or otherwise disposing of any of its property or assets except (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) property or assets that are no longer usable in its business or (iii) property or assets transferred between Energy West and its subsidiaries if the aggregate net book value of all properties and assets so disposed of during the twelve month period next preceding the date of such sale or disposition would constitute more than 15% of the aggregate book value of all Energy West's tangible assets. In addition, Energy West may only consummate a merger or consolidation, dissolve or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets (i) if there is no event of default, (ii) the provisions of the notes are assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation and such entity further agrees that it will continue to operate its facilities as part of a system comprising a public utility regulated by the MPSC or another federal or state agency or authority and (iii) the surviving or continuing corporation has a net worth immediately subsequent to such acquisition, consolidation or merger equal to or greater than $10,000.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSun Life Assurance Company of Canada\nOn May 2, 2011, we and our Ohio subsidiaries, NEO, Orwell and Brainard, issued a $15,334, 5.38% Senior Secured Guaranteed Fixed Rate Note due June 1, 2017 (\"Fixed Rate Note\"). Additionally, Great Plains issued a $3,000, Senior Secured Guaranteed Floating Rate Note that was repaid on May 3, 2014. Payments for these notes prior to maturity are interest-only.\nEach of the notes is governed by a Note Purchase Agreement ( NPA\u201d). Concurrent with the funding and closing of the notes, which occurred on May 3, 2011, the parties executed amended note purchase agreements.\nThe Fixed Rate Note is a joint obligation of our holding company and our Ohio subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by Gas Natural Inc., Lightning Pipeline and Great Plains (together with the Ohio subsidiaries, the Obligors\u201d). Prepayment of this note prior to maturity is subject to a 50 basis point make-whole premium. This note received approval from the PUCO on March 30, 2011. The note is governed by a note purchase agreement. Under the note purchase agreement, we are required to make monthly interest payments and the principal is due at maturity.\nOn October 24, 2012, Orwell, NEO, and Brainard issued a Senior Secured Guaranteed Note ( Senior Note\u201d) in the amount of $2,990. The Senior Note was placed pursuant to a third amendment to the original NPA dated as of November 1, 2010, by and among Orwell, NEO, and Brainard, and Great Plains, Lightning Pipeline, Gas Natural and Sun Life. The Senior Note has an interest rate of 4.15%, compounded semi-annually, and matures on June 1, 2017. The Senior Note is a joint obligation of the Ohio subsidiaries and is guaranteed by our non-regulated Ohio subsidiaries.\nThe Sun Life covenants restrict certain cash balances and requires a debt service reserve account to be maintained to cover approximately one year of interest payments. The total balance in the debt service reserve accounts was $948 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is included in restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt service reserve account cannot be used for operating cash needs.\nThe Fixed Rate Note and Senior Note contain various covenants, which include, among others, limitations on total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness, limitations on asset sales, and maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios as outlined below.\nThe amendments provide that any cash dividends, distributions, redemptions or repurchases of common stock may be made by the obligors to the holding company only if (i) the aggregate amount of all such dividends, distributions, redemptions and repurchases for the fiscal year do not exceed 70% of net income of the obligors for the four fiscal quarters then ending determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending, and (ii) there exists no other event of default at the time the dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase is made.\nThe Ohio subsidiaries are prohibited from creating, assuming or incurring additional indebtedness except for (i) obligations under certain financing agreements, (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500,000 at any one time outstanding, (iii) indebtedness outstanding as of March 31, 2011, (iv) certain unsecured intercompany indebtedness and (v) certain other indebtedness permitted under the notes.\nThe notes prohibit us from selling or otherwise transferring assets except in the ordinary course of business and to the extent such sales or transfers, in the aggregate, over each rolling twelve month period, do not exceed 1% of our total assets. Generally, we may consummate a merger or consolidation if there is no event of default and the provisions of the notes are assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation. We are also generally limited in making acquisitions in excess of 10% of our total assets. An event of default, if not cured, would require us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the notes as well as any and all interest and other payments due. An event of default would also entitle Sun Life to exercise certain rights with respect to the collateral that secures the indebtedness incurred under the notes.\nThe Fixed Rate Note requires an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis. The interest coverage ratio is measured with respect to the Obligors on a consolidated basis and also with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. The note generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA to gross interest expense. The note defines EBITDA as net income plus the sum of interest expense, any provision for federal, state, and local taxes, depreciation, and amortization determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but excluding any extraordinary non-operating income or loss and any gain or loss from non-operating transactions. The notes also require that we do not permit indebtedness to exceed 60% of capitalization at any time. Like the interest coverage ratio, the ratio of debt to capitalization is measured on a consolidated basis for the Obligors, and again on a consolidated basis with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRing Fencing Restrictions\nIn addition to the financial covenants under our credit facilities, the ring fencing provisions required by our regulatory commissions impose additional limitations on our liquidity. Specifically, usage of the Bank of America line of credit is regulated by ring fencing provisions from the MPSC, MPUC and NCUC. One of the ring fencing provisions issued by the MPSC requires that of the $30,000 line of credit available, $11,200 must be used or available to be used exclusively by Energy West Montana. The remaining $18,800 balance of the line of credit is available for use by Energy West and its other Montana, North Carolina and Maine subsidiaries. Energy West and Energy West Montana are required to provide monthly financial reports to the MPSC. We continue to monitor our compliance under these ring fencing provisions on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2015, we had available $9,168 to be drawn on the Bank of America line of credit after giving effect to the $11,200 allocation to Energy West Montana.\nOn November 24, 2014, the MPSC issued an order directing, in part, that Energy West require Gas Natural to repay an intercompany payable to Energy West by December 24, 2014. In addition, the MPSC order restricted Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries from paying dividends to Gas Natural until persuasive evidence could be presented that Energy West was on a sound financial footing and that effect had been given to the MPSC's ring-fencing conditions; the strongest indication being the absence of ongoing balances owed to Energy West by Gas Natural. On April 9, 2015, Energy West filed a request to reinstate Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to Gas Natural. On July 22, 2015, the MPSC issued an order allowing for the reinstatement of the dividends. They also approved a special dividend to be declared from the proceeds from the sale of Energy West's subsidiaries EWW and Pipeline assets.\nRing fencing provisions also subject us to certain restrictions on our capital structure. The MPSC requires Energy West to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than 52%. The total restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries related to debt covenants and the ring fencing is $76,233, or 79.8% of our net assets of $95,489 as of December 31, 2015. We believe we are in compliance with all ring fencing provisions.\nCorporate Structural Revisions and Pending Financing Agreements\nIn February 2016, we proposed to create a wholly-owned subsidiary under which each of our nine regulated entities will be held. This will streamline our corporate structure to facilitate greater focus on the four regulatory jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as to simplify our financing arrangements. With the new structure, which is subject to regulatory approval, the regulated entities will be segregated from non-regulated operations. We also announced that we reached an agreement with our lenders to refinance and consolidate our debt within our parent company. The long-term debt agreements include proposed issuance of up to $50,000 of senior notes, with maturities and interest rates to be determined upon closing, subject to prevailing market conditions at that time. Additionally, we will establish a $42,000 five-year revolving credit facility and finance a lease buyout of approximately $7,000 over a term of four years. Closing on the debt agreements is subject to negotiation of terms, requested regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Upon closing, proceeds from the new debt facilities will replace our five existing loan facilities and provide additional cash for operational purposes.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations that require cash payment over future periods at December 31, 2015, were as follows:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due in years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 - 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 - 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Line of credit (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Related party note payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Build-to-suit lease (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas purchase obligations (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Pipeline & storage capacity obligations (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The principle balance on our line of credit is not due until 2017, however due to its classification as a current liability it has been included as a contractual obligation due in 2016.\n(2) Build-to-suit lease is related to the third phase of our new ERP system, and will be evaluated for sale leaseback treatment upon its completion in 2016.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future performance. However, future performance involves risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a natural gas company, primarily operating local distribution companies in four states and serving approximately 67,800 customers in total. Our natural gas utility subsidiaries are Bangor Gas Company (Maine), Brainard Gas Corp. (Ohio), Cut Bank Gas Company (Montana), Energy West Montana (Montana), Frontier Natural Gas (North Carolina), Northeast Ohio Natural Gas Corporation (Ohio) and Orwell Natural Gas Company (Ohio). Each of these entities is regulated in their respective states and operates under tariffs which allow them to collect revenue sufficient to recover their operating costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their rate base. Approximately 93%, 93% and 89%, of our revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were derived from our natural gas utility operations.\nOur operations also include the marketing and production of natural gas. Our marketing and production subsidiaries are Energy West Resources (Montana and Wyoming) and Gas Natural Resources (Ohio). Our marketing and production subsidiaries obtain gas from interstate pipelines, local producers, and from small production wells in which it owns an interest. This gas is then sold to regulated utilities, commercial and industrial customers that are the end users of the commodity. In 2015, our marketing and production subsidiaries marketed approximately 1.5 Bcf of natural gas in three states.\nAs part of this discussion and analysis of our operating results we refer to increases and decreases in heating degree days. A heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit. In any given period, sales volumes reflect the impact of weather, in addition to other factors. We do not have a weather normalization adjustment in our rates and as a result, our revenue is sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Colder temperatures generally result in increased sales, while warmer temperatures generally result in reduced sales.\nWe recorded gains on our discontinued operations during 2015 related to the sale of EWW of $4,869 and the sale of the Pipeline Assets of $499. The following summarizes the critical events that impacted our results of continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2015:\nGross margin decreased due to:\n \u00b7 the executed stipulation with the PUCO Staff in the second quarter of 2015, which related to the most recent gas cost recovery audits in Ohio and specified a disallowance of gas costs of $693 over amounts previously accrued, \n \u00b7 the lower sales volumes in our Montana market caused lower gross margin in 2015, compared to 2014, \n \u00b7 volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation in our North Carolina market were adjusted downward $234 in 2015, compared to 2014, \n \u00b7 an adjustment to deferred gas costs in our Clarion River and Walker Gas divisions in Ohio lowered gross margin by $184 in the third quarter of 2015, and \n \u00b7 a partially offsetting increase in gross margin in our Maine market due to the activation of the Loring pipeline and the higher sales volumes in 2015, compared to 2014. \nOperating expenses increased as a result of the following:\n \u00b7 increases related to personnel costs of $764, legal fees of $675, depreciation, amortization and accretion of $600, and property taxes of $192 in 2015 compared to 2014, \n \u00b7 we incurred operating expenses related to the implementation of our new ERP system, including general and administrative expense of $606, maintenance expense of $265 depreciation of $163 and interest expense of $237, and \n \u00b7 our provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $834 in 2015 compared to 2014, offsetting the increases in operating expenses listed above. In 2014 we wrote-off of uncollectible accounts of $1,056 related to the unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. \nIn addition, we recorded a net charge to other income of $335 for our loss on the disposals of assets at our Clarion, Walker and PGC utilities, and the sale of an office building in Mentor, Ohio.\n 23 \nWe are focused on building rate base profitably in all of our jurisdictions, maintaining cost discipline, adherence to safety standards, and generating recurring streams of earnings and cash flow that support our continued investment in fixed assets, as well as a return on capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\nGas Prices and Revenues\nDue to the price volatility of gas and our ability to pass our cost of gas on to our customers, we believe that revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in gas prices, our revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in sales volumes or gross margin. We consider gross margin to be a better measure of comparative performance than revenues. However, gas prices and revenues can impact our working capital requirements; see \"Operating Cash Flow\" below.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements. We analyze our estimates, including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process. Our regulated natural gas segment continues to be cost-of-service rate regulated, and we believe the application of ASC 980 - Regulated Operations to that segment continues to be appropriate. We must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date. If, as a result of a change in circumstances, we determine that the regulated natural gas segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under ASC 980, that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities.\nThe application of ASC 980 results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before we have received approval for recovery from the state regulatory agencies. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base this conclusion on certain factors, including changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies, and the status of any potential new legislation. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers. At December 31, 2015, our total regulatory assets were $3,992 and our total regulatory liabilities were $1,738. A write-off of our regulatory assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur natural gas segment contains regulated utility businesses in the states of Maine, Montana, North Carolina and Ohio, and the regulation varies from state to state. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, we would be required to charge these assets to current earnings. However, there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets. In addition, deregulation would be a change that occurs over time, due to legal processes and procedures, which could moderate the impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nA significant regulatory asset/liability relates to the recoverable/refundable costs of gas purchases. We account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies, under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes.\nOur gas cost recoveries are monitored closely by the regulatory commissions in all of the states in which we operate. The gas cost recoveries are adjusted monthly in three of the four states in which we operate, and semi-annually in the other one. In addition, all of the states in which we operate require us to submit gas procurement plans, which we closely follow. These plans are reviewed annually by each of the regulatory commissions. The adjustment of gas cost recoveries and the gas procurement plans reduce the risk of disallowance of recoverable gas costs. Based on our experience, we believe it is highly probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded.\n 24 \nWe use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory commissions, however, can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccumulated Provisions for Doubtful Accounts\nWe encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable. As such, we record a provision for those accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, we primarily utilize current conditions as well as historical bad debt write-offs as a percentage of aged receivables. The underlying assumptions used for the provision can change from period to period and the provision could potentially cause a material impact to our financial statements by overstating liquidity and over-valuing net worth. The actual weather, commodity prices, and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact our operating income.\nUnbilled Revenue and Gas Costs\nWe estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each meter reading cycle to the month end. This estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period. Unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end.\nEach month we record the estimated unbilled revenue amounts as revenue and a receivable, and we reverse the prior month's estimate. Likewise, we record associated gas costs as cost of revenue and a payable, and we reverse prior month's estimate. Actual price and usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact revenues recognized and costs recorded. The critical component of calculating unbilled revenue is estimating the usage on a calendar month basis. Our estimated volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation have varied from our actual monthly metered volumes by less than plus or minus 10% on December 31, 2015 and 2014. A 10% change in our unbilled revenue at December 31, 2015, would have impacted our gross margin by $177.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair values of marketable securities are estimated based on the closing share price on the quoted market price for those investments. The fair values of our derivative instruments are estimated based on the difference between the fixed commodity price designated in the agreement and the commodity futures price for the settlement period at the measurement date. The fair value measure of our contingent consideration liability has significant unobservable inputs, including our weighted average cost of capital, our credit spread above the risk free rate and our forecasted future cash flows. A significant increase (decrease) in these inputs could result in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value measure.\nDeferred Tax Asset and Income Tax Accruals\nJudgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes, regulations, and income tax examinations require that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process.\nWe have a deferred tax asset of approximately $5,700 as of December 31, 2015, related to the carryover tax basis of Frontier Utilities and Penobscot Natural Gas, which we acquired in 2007. The carryover tax basis is subject to the limitations in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limited our tax depreciation in tax years 2007 through 2012. We have approximately $14,676 of carryover tax basis remaining as of December 31, 2015, and will recognize potential future federal and state income tax benefits of approximately $5,700 over the remaining life of the carryover tax basis of the assets. For federal income tax purposes, we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will be realized in future reporting periods based on future taxable income projections. For state income tax purposes, we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will not be realized, due to state net operating loss carryovers and future state taxable income projections. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $1,564 on the state deferred tax assets associated with the carryover tax basis of our subsidiaries acquired in 2007.\nManagement reevaluates the valuation allowance annually based on future taxable income projections and adjusts our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets. If the projections indicate that we are unable to use all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, we will adjust the valuation allowance to income tax expense. Our valuation allowance is based on projections of our taxable income in future reporting years. Based on future taxable income projections, our state net operating losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $4,913 on our state deferred tax asset associated with state net operating losses.\n 25 \nFor the federal tax portion, the five year Internal Revenue Code limitation period discussed above expired in 2012. Based on our estimates of taxable income, we project that we will recover approximately 98% of the remaining benefit in the next eight years, with 2% recovered in small increments in the remaining years. Based on this analysis, we believe that a valuation allowance on the federal portion of the benefit is not necessary. Failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a write-down in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected and could also lead to the expiration of the deferred tax asset between now and 2029, either of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, rather, the goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, which we perform in the fourth quarter, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We test for goodwill impairment using a two-step approach. A recoverability test at the reporting unit level must be performed during the first step. If the asset is not recoverable, the second step calculates the impairment loss, if any. Our impairment evaluations as of December 31, 2015, indicated that our goodwill is fully recoverable. During 2015, we sold the assets of our PGC subsidiary and recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $284 based on the carrying value of our assets and our estimated costs to sell the assets, which is included in the computation of our loss on the sale of PGC. See Note 6- Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nThe schedule below shows the goodwill balances allocated to our Ohio and GNR subsidiaries as well as the excess of their fair values over their carrying values as of December 31, 2015, if any:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Enterprise </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect on enterprise fair value of: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Enterprise </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% increase in weighted </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% decline in </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Unit </td> <td> </td> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>average cost of capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>residual growth rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ohio subsidiaries </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,450 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,400 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>GNR subsidiary </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cut Bank subsidiary </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is a degree of uncertainty related to assumptions used to determine fair value. There are estimates and assumptions for organic growth, market equity risk, realized return on equity investments, market multiples, risk premium for size, weighted average cost of capital, capital structure, and tax rate. Weather can negatively impact our key assumptions and results.\nWhen testing goodwill impairment of our subsidiaries, the enterprise value calculations were determined by putting an equal emphasis on a discounted cash flow method and a guideline public company method. The key assumptions made for each approach used in the impairment testing were (1) weighted average cost of capital of 7.0-13.5%; (2) perpetuity growth rate of 2.5%; and (3) operating EBITDA forecasts. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from these impairment tests.\nLease Commitments\nEach time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects whether and how the transaction is reflected in our balance sheet, as well as our recognition of rental payments as rent or interest expense. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and residual value of leased properties, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows that may be realized from the leased properties. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. Other aspects of our lease accounting policies relate to the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions, including the appropriate amortization any deferred gains or losses. Our lease accounting policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations and estimated useful lives. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not known at the time of our previous assessments, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties that we lease, result in a change in classification of some of our leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets.\n 26 \nResults of

</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax -The 2015 and 2014 results of our EWW subsidiary, historically included in the Natural Gas Operations segment, and the results of our pipeline operations segment have also been classified as discontinued operations as a result of a sale agreement executed on October 10, 2014. In addition, the 2015 and 2014 results of our propane operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the assets of Independence in November 2013. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail. Our income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 was $3,519 or $0.34 per share, compared to $1,033 or $0.10 per share for 2014. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2015 primarily consisted of a net gain recorded on the sale of EWW of $4,869 and the net gain for the sale of the Pipeline Assets of $499.\nIncome from continuing operations - Income from continuing operations for 2015 was $1,169, or $0.11 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $2,729 or $0.26 per share for 2014. Income from continuing operations decreased by $1,560 primarily due to: 1) increases in personnel related costs of $764 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor; 2) increased legal fees of $675 related to our ongoing legal matters; 3) increases in our expenses related to the implementation of our new ERP system, including operating expenses of $871, depreciation of $163 and interest expense of $237; 4) a charge of $693 in the second quarter of 2015 for additional disallowed gas cost beyond amounts accrued from the stipulation with the PUCO Staff in the most recent gas cost recovery audit in Ohio; and 5) an offsetting increase to revenues from the Loring pipeline, customer growth and colder weather in our Maine market. Loss from our gas marketing and production operations decreased by $1,320, primarily as a result of a decrease in bad debt expense of $834 during 2015 because during the 2014 period because our marketing operation in Montana wrote-off $1,056 of uncollectible receivables resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, we experienced a decrease of $1,131 in our income tax expenses based on our income before taxes, which declined for the reasons listed above. Loss from our corporate and other segment decreased by $136, primarily as a result of a decrease in our operating expenses of $534 that occurred because distribution, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our EWW subsidiary were reallocated to corporate in 2014 when we reclassified that subsidiary as discontinued operations.\n 27 \nRevenues - Revenues decreased by $20,209 to $112,361 during 2015 compared to $132,570 during 2014. Revenue from natural gas operations decreased by $19,075 due primarily to: 1) a decrease in the price of natural gas passed through to our customers in our Ohio, North Carolina and Montana markets; 2) decreased sales volumes due to warmer weather in our Montana market; 3) a decrease of $534 related to a downward adjustment to volumes used to calculate unbilled revenue in our North Carolina market in 2015, and partially offset by; 4) increases in revenue in Maine of $1,775 and $527 for transportation services to customers and the Loring pipeline, respectively. Our Loring pipeline began transportation services in September 2014. Revenue from our marketing and production operation decreased by $1,134 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition and significantly lower prices for volumes produced in our production operation.\nGross margin - Gross margin decreased by $617 to $44,235 for 2015 compared to $44,852 for 2014. Our natural gas operation's margins decreased $358, due primarily to: 1) a charge of $693 recorded in the second quarter of 2015 for additional disallowed gas cost beyond amounts accrued from the PUCO Staff stipulation in the gas cost recovery audit in Ohio; 2) lower sales in our Montana market due to warmer weather; 3) volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation in our North Carolina market were adjusted downward $234 in 2015, compared to 2014, and partially offset by; 4) increased margin from the Loring pipeline and customer growth and colder weather in our Maine market. Gross margin from our marketing & production operations decreased $259, primarily due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition and the lower prices for volumes produced in our production operation.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses increased by $1,474 to $39,227 for 2015 compared to $37,753 for the same period in 2014. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased $1,456 primarily due an increases in personnel related costs of $764 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor, and we experienced increased legal fees of $675. Additionally, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $248 for training related to our new ERP system and we recorded amortization of a deferred loss on the sale-leaseback transaction for our ERP system of $358. These increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease of $824 in other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $600 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $245 related to our regulatory asset in Frontier and as a result of an increase of $163 related to our ERP system assets placed in service during 2015. Taxes other than income increased by $192 due to property tax increases. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased $834 during 2015 because during the 2014 period, our marketing operation in Montana wrote-off $1,056 of uncollectible receivables resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nOther income (expense) - Other income (expense) decreased by $222 to $182 for 2015 compared to $404 for 2014. During 2015, changes in other income were the result of: 1) a net loss on the disposals of our Clarion, Walker, PGC and 8500 Station Street assets of $335; 2) a decrease in rental income of $156; 3) a decrease of approximately $132 in management fee income that we earned for operating natural gas facilities for third parties, and; 4) a decrease in interest income of $150 due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market in 2014 that did not recur in 2015. These decreases in other income (expense) were partially offset by a charge in 2014 to impair our investment in Kykuit, which did not recur in 2015, and as a result in unrealized gains on our commodity swap contracts.\nInterest expense - The following table presents changes in our interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our interest expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the completion and implementation of our build-to-suit ERP system and the related capital lease payments, and as a result of debt issue costs related to our short term loans with NIL Funding.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest related to current borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest related to long-term notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest related to capital leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt issue costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense decreased by $1,131 to $417 for 2015 compared to $1,548 for 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in our income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% for 2015 compared to 39.3% for 2014 as a result of a change in the proportion of our pre-tax income by state.\n 28 \nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared

to $109,400 for 2013. In our natural gas operation segment, the $25,820 increase was attributable to 1) colder weather in the majority of the markets we serve leading to a higher consumption of natural gas, 2) higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers of our regulated subsidiaries, and 3) growth in our customer base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $2,650 from our marketing and production segment. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $4,778 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in April 2014. Revenue from our western marketing operations decreased by $293 due to lower sales volumes. Offsetting these is the increase in revenue from our GNR subsidiary of $2,341 representing a full year of operations and the revenue increase from our production operation of $80.\nGross margin - Gross margin increased by $1,482 to $44,852 for 2014 compared to $43,370 for 2013. Our natural gas operations segment's margin increased $2,700 due to increased sales volumes from continued customer growth in Maine, North Carolina and Ohio, amplified by colder weather in all of our markets. Gross margin from our marketing and production segment decreased $1,218 primarily due to higher costs of natural gas used to supply fixed price sales contracts, the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline completion, and the loss of NEO and Orwell as customers. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses increased by $6,135 to $37,753 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $31,618 for the prior year period. Distribution, general and administrative expense increased by $3,462 due to 1) increased legal fees of $1,868 stemming primarily from the legal proceedings discussed in Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report; 2) an increase of $569 in consulting and auditing fees related to improving and testing our internal control environment; 3) increases in corporate payroll and benefits of $564; and 4) the write-off of $336 of construction work in progress relating to a software conversion project that has been terminated. Depreciation expense increased by $1,048 due to higher capital expenditures and the amortization of the regulatory asset by Frontier of $245. Taxes other than income increased by $255 primarily due to higher property, payroll and other taxes in our Ohio subsidiaries. The 2014 period included $1,056 in the provision for doubtful accounts resulting from a ruling against us in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Receivables in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail. The 2014 period included a net unrealized holding loss of $62 related to the earn-out provision in the JDOG Marketing purchase, compared to a net unrealized holding gain of $1,565 in 2013. These increases were partially offset by a $726 impairment to goodwill in the 2013 period.\n 29 \nOther income (expense) - Other income (expense) increased by $104 to $404 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $300 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $184 gain on the sale of marketable securities, a decrease in acquisition expense of $265 year over year, a decrease of $309 in S-3 costs and an increase in interest income of $172. This was partially offset by a $350 loss related to the impairment of our Kykuit investment and a $151 loss on derivative assets.\nInterest expense - Interest expense increased $50 to $3,226 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $3,176 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This change was primarily due to an increase of $4,410 in the average outstanding principle balances on our line of credit that is almost entirely offset by a decrease of $2,472 in the average outstanding principle balances on our notes payable and a decrease in average LIBOR, the basis for our floating interest rates, during the year.\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense decreased by $1,476 to $1,548 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3,024 for the same period in 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income from continuing operations. In addition, the 2014 and 2013 periods each included a tax benefit from the true-up to the prior year's tax return of $71 and $103, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 39.3% for 2014 and 37.5% for 2013. The 2013 period included a tax benefit of $336 related to a change in the state effective tax rates as discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax - The 2014 and 2013 results of our EWW subsidiary, pipeline operations segment, and propane operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding this topic.\n 30 \nNATURAL GAS

compared to $123,053 for 2014. This decrease is the result of the following factors:\n 1) Revenues from our Ohio market decreased $8,046. Revenue to full service customers decreased $7,942, primarily due to lower prices paid for natural gas passed on to our customers, along with a decrease of volumes sold to full service customers of 222 MMcf due to warmer weather. \n 2) Revenue from our Montana market decreased $6,533 primarily caused by a volume decrease of 474 MMcf during 2015 compared to 2014, due to warmer weather in 2015. A decrease in prices paid for natural gas passed on to our customers also contributed to the decreased revenue. \n 3) Revenue from our North Carolina market decreased by $3,332 due to 1) the $534 decrease from the adjustment to sales volumes used in our unbilled revenue calculation in the second quarter of 2015; 2) lower prices paid for natural gas passed through to customers; and 3) a decrease in sales volumes of 192 MMcf due to warmer weather. \n 4) We sold our PGC assets during 2015, and revenue from our Kentucky market where PGC operated decreased $466 during 2015 compared to 2014. \n 5) Revenue from our Maine market decreased $698. The decrease from 2014 is due to price decreases and a volume decrease of 59 MMcf, or $3,000 from full service customers. This decrease was offset by an increase of $1,775 for transportation services to customers and an increase in revenue of $527 from the Loring pipeline, which began transportation services in September 2014. \nGas purchases decreased by $18,717 to $60,380 for 2015, compared to $79,097 for 2014. This decrease is primarily due to lower gas costs passed through to customers in our Ohio, North Carolina and Montana markets as well as decreases in sales volumes in our Montana markets. In addition to lower gas costs, the following items impacted our 2015 gas purchases: 1) in the second quarter of 2015, we recorded $693 for additional disallowed gas costs over amounts previously accrued from the PUCO Staff stipulation in the gas cost recovery audit in Ohio, and 2) in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a $184 adjustment to gas costs in our Clarion River and Walker Gas divisions. Our gas costs are passed on dollar for dollar to our customers under tariffs regulated by the various commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gas costs are subject to periodic audits and prudency reviews in all of these jurisdictions.\nGross margin decreased by $358 to $43,598 for 2015 compared to $43,956 for 2014. Gross margin in our Ohio market decreased by $546, as a result of an adjustment for $693 of additional disallowed gas cost in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin in our Montana markets decreased by $352 due to lower sales volumes caused by warmer weather. Gross margin in our North Carolina market decreased by $442 due to the $234 adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 to decrease the lower volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation and as a result of lower sales volumes noted above. Kentucky decreased gross margin by $179. Partially offsetting these, gross margin in our Maine market increased by $1,161 due to the startup of the Loring pipeline and more favorable pricing arrangements.\n 32 \nEarnings\nThe natural gas operations segment's net income for 2015 was $3,476 or $0.33 per share, compared to earnings of $6,492, or $0.62 per share for 2014.\nOperating expenses increased by $3,672 to $35,746 for 2015 compared to $32,074 for 2014. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased by $2,576 due to: 1) increases in personnel related expenses of $1,029 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor; and 2) increases in expenses of $248 for training related to our new ERP system and we recorded amortization of a deferred loss on the sale-leaseback transaction for our ERP system of $354. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $699, of which $245 was a result of increased amortization of a regulatory asset at Frontier and $161 was a result of our ERP system placed in service during 2015. Taxes other than income increased by $206 due to increased property taxes. Increases in our depreciation and property taxes are a result of additions to our plant, property and equipment during 2014 and 2015.\nOther income decreased by $743 to $147 for 2015 compared to $890 for 2014. We experienced a decrease in rental income of $156, a decrease of approximately $132 in management fee income that we earned for operating natural gas facilities for third parties, and interest income decreased by $150 due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $1,920 to $1,741 for 2015 compared to $3,661 for 2014, primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income in 2015 compared to the 2014 period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013\nHeating Degree Days\nA heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent (Warmer) Colder </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 Compared to </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Normal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Normal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Great Falls, MT </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bangor, ME </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Elkin, NC </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Youngstown, OH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Jackson, KY </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues increased by $25,820 to $123,053 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $97,233 for the same period in 2013. This increase is the result of the following factors:\n 1) Revenue from our Montana market increased $4,740 on a volume increase of 298 MMcf in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to colder weather and higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers. \n 2) Revenue from our Ohio market increased by $6,240. Revenue from full service customers increased $6,011 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers and a volume increase of 492 MMcf resulting from a 5% increase in customers and colder weather. \n 3) Revenue from our Maine and North Carolina markets increased $14,527 on a volume increase from full service and transportation customers of 153 MMcf in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers and customer growth of 20%. The increase in the volumes from customer growth was offset by the loss of a large customer in our Maine market in the last half of 2014. The Loring pipeline, which began serving customers in October 2014 added $145 of additional revenue. \n 4) Revenue from our Kentucky markets increased $311 on a volume increase from full service residential customers of 30 MMcf in 2014 compared to 2013 due to colder weather and 4.5% customer growth. \n 33 \nGas purchased increased by $23,120 to $79,097 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $55,977 in 2013. The increase is due to higher prices for natural gas in 2014 compared to 2013 combined with the higher volume throughput for our full service distribution customers. Related to the in-progress PUCO audit of our gas cost recovery mechanisms in Ohio, included in the 2014 results is a true-up of $(301) to the accrual contained in the 2013 disallowance amount, offset by additional disallowed gas costs in 2014 of $987 for a net charge of $686. Included in the 2013 results is a charge of $1,502 for the disallowance of gas costs resulting from a previous gas cost recovery audit by the PUCO.\nGross margin increased by $2,700 to $43,956 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $41,256 for the same period in 2013 due to customer growth in our Maine, North Carolina and Ohio markets and colder weather in all of our service territories. Ohio accounted for $2,188 of the increase, Maine and North Carolina for $862, and Kentucky for $131. These increases in margin were offset partially by a decrease in margin in our Montana natural gas operations of $481.\nEarnings\nThe natural gas operations segment's income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $6,492, or $0.62 per share, compared to $6,821, or $0.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOperating expenses increased by $2,681 to $32,074 for 2014, compared to $29,393 for 2013. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,326 due primarily to the increases in allocations of corporate expenses related to the hiring of new corporate personnel and to improving and auditing our internal control environment. Depreciation expense increased $989 due to the increased capital expenditures and the amortization of the regulatory asset in Frontier of $245. Other taxes increased $279 due primarily to increased property and payroll taxes in our Ohio subsidiaries.\nOther income increased by $123 to $890 for 2014 compared to $767 for 2013. Interest income increased by $176 primarily due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market. Gains on disposal of property decreased $39 for 2014 compared to 2013. Income from service sales in 2014 decreased by $62 compared to 2013. Additionally, we had no acquisition related costs in 2014, compared to $47 related to the purchase of an office building asset in 2013.\nInterest expense increased by $53 to $2,619 for 2014 compared to $2,566 for 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased borrowing on the line of credit resulting in $134 of additional interest expense and $51 of increased interest expense related to the change in estimate of the recoverable purchased gas costs in our Ohio markets. Partially offsetting these increases, the payoff of the senior secured guaranteed floating rate note on May 3, 2014, resulted in $83 less interest. In addition, decreased principal balances on our debt and capital lease obligation resulted in $15 and $38 less interest, respectively, compared to 2013.\nIncome tax expense increased by $418 to $3,661 for 2014 compared to $3,243 for 2013 due primarily to the increase in pre-tax income. Both 2014 and 2013 included a true-up of the prior year's tax return for a benefit of $75 and $95, respectively. The 2013 period included a tax benefit related to a change in the state effective tax rates as discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\n 34 \nMarketing & Production\nIncome Statement\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and production </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,167 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas purchased </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,114 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(177 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,582 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) before interest and taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,084 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(135 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(142 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,205 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax benefit (expense) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(586 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(113 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,433 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,036 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues decreased by $1,134 to $8,383 for 2015 compared to $9,517 for 2014. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $1,389 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in 2014. Our GNR subsidiary contributed revenue of $3,222, which is a decrease of $1,067 from 2014 due primarily to lower prices charged to customers. Revenue from our production operation decreased by $501 due to significantly lower prices for volumes produced. Offsetting these is an increase in revenue from our EWR marketing operation by $1,823 due primarily to the sales of gas to EWW after that entity was sold to Cheyenne.\nGross margin decreased by $259 to $637 for 2015 compared to $896 for 2014. Gross margin from our LNG business decreased by $213 as a result of the loss of our LNG customer. Gross margin from our EWR production operation decreased by $180 due the lower prices on volumes produced. Gross margin on EWR marketing operations increased by $69 due to higher margins per unit on volumes sold.\nEarnings\nThe marketing and production segment's loss for 2015 was $113, or $0.01 per share, compared to a loss of $1,433, or $0.14 per share for 2014.\nOperating expenses decreased by $1,664 to $814 for 2015 compared to $2,478 for 2014. Our professional fees expenses declined by $261 during 2015, as compared to 2014. Additionally, during 2014, we wrote off $1,056 in uncollectible accounts expense resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nOther income (expense) increased by $605 to income of $103 for 2015 compared to expense of $502 for 2014, because in 2014 we impaired our investment in Kykuit, which did not recur in 2015, and as a result of an increase in unrealized gains on our commodity swap contracts.\nIncome tax benefit decreased by $676 to $96 for 2015 compared to $772 for 2014, primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income in 2015, compared to 2014.\n 35 \nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues decreased by $2,650 to $9,517 for 2014 compared to $12,167 for 2013. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $4,778 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in 2014. Revenues from our existing gas marketing operation decreased by $294, due primarily to lower sales volumes. Offsetting these, our GNR subsidiary's revenue increased by $2,342 as a result of its first full year in operation and revenue from our production operation increased by $80.\nGross margin decreased by $1,218 to $896 for 2014 compared to $2,114 for 2013. Gross margin from our gas marketing operation decreased by $630 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher costs of natural gas used to supply fixed price sales contracts, and the lower sales volumes. Gross margin from our LNG business decreased by $329 and GNR's margin decreased by $250 in 2014 due to the loss NEO and Orwell as customers. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details. Margin from our production operation decreased by $9.\nEarnings\nThe marketing and production segment's loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1,433, or $0.14 per share, compared to income of $1,036, or $0.12 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOperating expenses increased by $1,977 to $2,478 for 2014, compared to $501 for 2013. Our GNR subsidiary was responsible for $1,053 of increased expenses in 2014, compared to 2013. The 2014 period included a full year of operating results, compared to seven months of 2013. The year ended December 31, 2013, included an unrealized holding gain on the contingent consideration liability of $1,565, partially offset by a goodwill impairment expense of $726. Expenses from our existing western marketing and production operations increased by $925 due primarily to the increase in bad debt expense of $1,056, resulting from a ruling against us in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Receivables in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail.\nOther income decreased by $653 to a loss of $502 for 2014, compared to income of $151 for 2013. During 2014, we recorded an expense of $350 related to the impairment of our investment in Kykuit. See Note 7 - Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. During 2014, we also recorded a mark to market loss of $151 related to natural gas swap contracts and the 2013 period includes a gain on the sale of compressed natural gas equipment of $154.\nInterest expense decreased by $21 to an expense of $121 for 2014 compared to expense of $142 for 2013.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $1,358 to a benefit of $772 for 2014 compared to expense of $586 for the same period in 2013. Both 2014 and 2013 each included a tax benefit from the true-up to the prior year's tax return of $8 and $6 respectively, accounting for a decrease in expense of $2. The remaining decrease is due primarily to the decrease in pre-tax income.\n 36 \nCorporate & Other\nOur corporate and other reporting segment is intended primarily to encompass the results of corporate acquisitions, other equity transactions, and certain other income and expense items associated with our holding company functions as well as the results of our discontinued operations. Therefore, it does not have standard revenues, gas purchase costs, or gross margin.\nIncome Statement\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas purchased </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,667 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,201 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,724 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(618 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before interest and taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,735 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,342 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(687 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(486 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(468 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,422 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,671 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,810 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,194 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,330 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,005 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discontinued operations, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,297 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,186 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nResults of our corporate and other segment for the year ended December 31, 2015, include administrative costs of $2,667, interest expense of $687, corporate expenses of $68, offset by an income tax benefit of $1,228, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,194, or $0.21 per share. Loss from our corporate and other segment from continuing operations decreased by $136, primarily as a result of a decrease in our operating expenses of $534 that occurred because distribution, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our EWW subsidiary were reallocated to corporate in 2014 when we reclassified that subsidiary as discontinued operations.\nResults of our corporate and other segment for the year ended December 31, 2014, include administrative costs of $3,201, interest expense of $486, a gain on marketable securities of $184, acquisition related costs of $7, corporate expenses of $171, offset by an income tax benefit of $1,341, and interest and other income of $10, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,330, or $0.22 per share.\nResults of corporate and other operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, include administrative costs of $1,724, acquisition related costs of $225, costs related to expenses for our former chief executive officer's stock sale of $309, corporate expenses of $98, interest expense of $468, offset by an income tax benefit of $805, and interest and other income of $14, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,005, or $0.21 per share.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the sale of our Independence subsidiary in 2013 and the sale of our EWW subsidiary and Glacier & Shoshone pipelines in 2015, the results of the operations for these items have been reclassified to discontinued operations in our corporate and other operating segment. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding these sales.\n 37 \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn the ordinary course of operations, we incur expenses for natural gas purchases, general and administrative expenses, and pipeline construction purchases from companies owned or controlled by Richard M. Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer. For more information, see Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding all of our related party transactions.\nCapital Sources and Liquidity\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our operating and financing expenses and to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are:\n \u00b7 our cash balance; \n \u00b7 our operating cash flow; \n \u00b7 our revolving credit facility; \n \u00b7 our potential to borrow from related parties, as further described below under the heading Financing Cash Flow\u201d; \n \u00b7 our potential to issue debt and equity securities; and \n \u00b7 our potential to finance or sell assets we own. \nWe believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are:\n \u00b7 our ability to refinance our credit facility that matures in April 2017; \n \u00b7 decreased demand for our natural gas as a result of competition in our markets; \n \u00b7 the negative impact on our working capital requirements of volatile natural gas prices and the potential for natural gas prices to increase; \n \u00b7 decreased demand for natural gas used for heating as a result of warmer than average temperatures; and \n \u00b7 decreased demand for natural gas used for heating as a result of increased energy efficiency in new homes and appliances. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nOperating activities provide our primary source of cash and are supplemented by our revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $2,728 and $1,586 of cash on hand, respectively. The results of our EWW and Independence subsidiaries and Glacier & Shoshone pipeline operations are presented separately as discontinued operations. We do not expect the disposition of these subsidiaries and assets to have a material negative impact on our liquidity.\nOur ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), which had a balance of $15,750 and $28,761 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the balance of our revolving line of credit is primarily a result of our cash proceeds from the sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, as well as decreased capital expenditures in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nDuring 2015, we entered into two short term loan agreements with NIL Funding. On October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments to NIL Funding and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity. We made a principal payment of $1,000 on the note during December 2015. On April 6, 2015, we entered into a $5,000 loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding that had a maturity date of October 3, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished. NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nWe made capital expenditures of $9,567, $21,613 and $23,517 for 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively. We finance our capital expenditures by the use of our operating cash flow and our Bank of America revolving line of credit. Long-term debt was $39,721 and $40,263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including the amounts due within one year.\n 38 \nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash Flows from Continuing Operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,195 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,679 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,192 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,303 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,003 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,485 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase (decrease) in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,536 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(511 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(590 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash provided by operating activities was $9,424, $11,146 and $15,439 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in the price of natural gas and lower sales volumes, which caused a $6,482 decrease in cash outflows from accounts payable as a result of less accounts payable outstanding at the end of 2015, compared to 2014, partially offset by a $2,184 increase in cash received from accounts receivable and $1,697 increase in cash received from natural gas and propane inventory as a result of lower balances outstanding at the end of 2015, compared to 2014. Major items affecting operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 include: a decrease in income from continuing operations of $3,123, a $2,977 increase in our net regulatory assets and liabilities, a $2,528 decrease in unbilled revenue, a $1,458 increase in payments of other liabilities, a $1,296 increase in accounts receivable collections, a $1,294 increase in accounts payable payments, and a $1,100 increase in prepayments.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $4,195, $18,679 and $20,192 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The changes in our cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by our cash used for capital expenditures and partially offset by cash provided by contributions in aid of construction.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures totaled $9,567, $21,613 and $23,517 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of our capital spending is focused on the growth of our natural gas operations segment. We conduct ongoing construction activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion, maintenance, and enhancement of our gas pipeline systems. We are actively expanding our systems in North Carolina and Maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service in those service areas. Capital expenditures for 2015 and 2014 included $1,482 and $948 in capital expenditures related to our new ERP system that were not financed under a lease agreement. Additionally, in 2013 we purchased an office building in Mentor, Ohio for $1,853, which amount is included in our capital expenditures.\nThe table below presents our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and provides our estimate of cash requirements for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing & production </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate & other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,517 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 39 \nWe have budgeted for $4,707 of capital expenditures in 2016 in our natural gas operations segment, which will primarily focus on the continued expansion of our natural gas utilities service areas. These expenditures will have an emphasis on our Maine, North Carolina and Ohio markets.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nCash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $19,303 and $5,003, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities was $12,485 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Major items affecting financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 include: a net increase of $17,242 in the repayment of our line of credit, a net increase in borrowings from notes payable of $4,921, and an increase of $1,667 in payments of capital lease obligations. Major items affecting financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 include: a $16,721 decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common shares, a $3,561 net increase in proceeds from the line of credit, a $2,830 net increase in the repayment of our notes payable, a $653 increase in payments of dividends, and $617 decrease in the release of restricted cash balances.\nHistorically, to the extent that cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our expenditure requirements, including costs of gas purchased and capital expenditures, we have used our revolving line of credit. In general, our short-term borrowing needs for purchases of gas inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short-term borrowing needs for financing customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months. The cash flow from our business is seasonal and the line of credit balance in December normally represents the high point of borrowings in our annual cash flow cycle. Generally, our cash flow increases and our borrowings decrease, beginning in January, as monthly heating bills are paid and the gas we paid for and placed in storage in the summer months is used to supply our customers. Our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, which had a balance of $15,750 and $28,761 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, we had a short-term note payable with a principal balance of $2,000 with NIL Funding. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short term borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, was 2.95%, 2.45%, and 2.42%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on our current borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 2.71% and 2.44%, respectively. We periodically repay our short-term borrowings under the Bank of America revolving line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long-term debt and equity securities. Long-term debt was $39,721 and $40,263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including the amounts due within one year.\nBank of America Credit Agreement and Line of Credit\nOur Energy West subsidiary has a credit facility with the Bank of America ( Credit Facility\u201d) that provides for a revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of $30,000, due April 1, 2017. On November 26, 2014, we entered into an amendment temporarily increasing the borrowing capacity by $10,000 to a maximum of $40,000 until July 1, 2015, and the additional capacity was repaid prior to that date. The MPSC restricted draws on the line of credit to only Energy West and its subsidiary companies. This revolving credit facility includes an annual commitment fee ranging from 25 to 45 basis points of the unused portion of the facility and accrues interest based on our option of two indices - a base rate, which is defined as a daily rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or the daily LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, or LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points. At December 31, 2015, we did not have any base rate borrowings.\nOur average borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $19,838 and $23,397, respectively. The maximum borrowings were $30,911 and $31,061 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which balances occurred during the first and fourth quarters of the year, respectively. The minimum borrowings were $15,750 and $19,061 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which balances occurred during the third and second quarters of the year, respectively. Total borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $15,750 and $28,761, and bore interest at a weighted average outstanding rate of 2.17% and 2.44%, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. After considering outstanding letters of credit of $155, a total of $14,095 was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, Energy West has a $10,000 term loan with Bank of America with a maturity date of April 1, 2017 (the \"Term Loan\"). The Term Loan portion of the Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points and contains an interest rate swap provision that allows for the interest rate to be fixed in the future, but we have not exercised that provision. The Term Loan amortizes at a rate of $125 per quarter. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Term Loan bore interest at 2.17%, and had a balance of $8,375 and $8,875, respectively.\nThe Bank of America revolving credit agreement and term loan contain various covenants, which include limitations on total dividends and distributions, limitations on investments in other entities, maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios, and restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined below.\n 40 \nThe credit facility restricts Energy West's ability to pay dividends and make distributions, redemptions and repurchases of stock during the preceding 60-month period to 80% of its net income over that period. In addition, no event of default may exist at the time such dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase is made.\nThe credit facility limits investments in another entity by acquisition of any debt or equity securities or assets or by making loans or advances to such entity. Energy West is also prohibited from consummating a merger or consolidation or selling all or substantially all of its assets or stock except for (i) any merger, consolidation or sale by or with certain of its subsidiaries, (ii) any such purchase or other acquisition by Energy West or certain of its subsidiaries and (iii) sales and dispositions of assets for at least fair market value so long as the net book value of all assets sold or otherwise disposed of in any fiscal year does not exceed 5% of the net book value of Energy West's assets as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year.\nEnergy West must maintain a total debt-to-capital ratio of not more than .55-to-1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.0-to-1.0. The credit facility restricted Energy West's ability to create, incur or assume indebtedness except (i) indebtedness under the credit facility (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases including the capital lease related to the Loring pipeline, and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500, (iii) certain indebtedness of Energy West's subsidiaries, (iv) certain subordinated indebtedness, (v) certain hedging obligations and (vi) other indebtedness not to exceed $1,000.\nNIL Funding\nOn October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. The note bears interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and matures on April 20, 2016. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments to NIL Funding and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity. We made a principal payment of $1,000 on the note during December 2015. Our loan agreement with NIL Funding restricts our ability to incur additional borrowings, make new investments, consummate a merger or acquisition and dispose of assets. In an event of default, as defined under the loan agreement, NIL Funding may, at its option, require us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the note as well as any and all interest and other payments due or convert any part of the amounts due and unpaid to shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 95% of the previous day's closing price on the NYSE MKT. NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nOn April 6, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding. Pursuant to the note and loan agreement, NIL Funding loaned Gas Natural $5,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 7.5%, and a maturity date of October 3, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished.\nSenior Unsecured Notes of Energy West\nOn June 29, 2007, Energy West authorized the sale of $13,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.16% Senior Unsecured Notes with Allstate/CUNA, due June 29, 2017. In connection with our sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to repay the portion of notes payable to Allstate/CUNA that was allocated to EWW and EWD on February 12, 2016, including a prepayment penalty of $310. Additionally, we wrote off the unamortized debt issue costs that were allocated to EWW and EWD's portion of the debt, totaling $103. These amounts were recognized within discontinued operations, net of tax on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our discontinued operations.\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes contain various covenants, which include limitations on Energy West's total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined below, maintenance of certain interest coverage ratios, and limitations on asset sales as outlined below.\nThe credit facility limits Energy West's total dividends and distributions made in the immediately preceding 60-month period to 100% of aggregate consolidated net income for such period.\nThe notes restrict Energy West from incurring additional senior indebtedness in excess of 65% of capitalization at any time.\nThe credit facility also requires Energy West to maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than 150% of the pro forma annual interest charges on a consolidated basis in two of the three preceding fiscal years.\nEnergy West is prohibited from selling or otherwise disposing of any of its property or assets except (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) property or assets that are no longer usable in its business or (iii) property or assets transferred between Energy West and its subsidiaries if the aggregate net book value of all properties and assets so disposed of during the twelve month period next preceding the date of such sale or disposition would constitute more than 15% of the aggregate book value of all Energy West's tangible assets. In addition, Energy West may only consummate a merger or consolidation, dissolve or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets (i) if there is no event of default, (ii) the provisions of the notes are assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation and such entity further agrees that it will continue to operate its facilities as part of a system comprising a public utility regulated by the MPSC or another federal or state agency or authority and (iii) the surviving or continuing corporation has a net worth immediately subsequent to such acquisition, consolidation or merger equal to or greater than $10,000.\n 41 \nSun Life Assurance Company of Canada\nOn May 2, 2011, we and our Ohio subsidiaries, NEO, Orwell and Brainard, issued a $15,334, 5.38% Senior Secured Guaranteed Fixed Rate Note due June 1, 2017 (\"Fixed Rate Note\"). Additionally, Great Plains issued a $3,000, Senior Secured Guaranteed Floating Rate Note that was repaid on May 3, 2014. Payments for these notes prior to maturity are interest-only.\nEach of the notes is governed by a Note Purchase Agreement ( NPA\u201d). Concurrent with the funding and closing of the notes, which occurred on May 3, 2011, the parties executed amended note purchase agreements.\nThe Fixed Rate Note is a joint obligation of our holding company and our Ohio subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by Gas Natural Inc., Lightning Pipeline and Great Plains (together with the Ohio subsidiaries, the Obligors\u201d). Prepayment of this note prior to maturity is subject to a 50 basis point make-whole premium. This note received approval from the PUCO on March 30, 2011. The note is governed by a note purchase agreement. Under the note purchase agreement, we are required to make monthly interest payments and the principal is due at maturity.\nOn October 24, 2012, Orwell, NEO, and Brainard issued a Senior Secured Guaranteed Note ( Senior Note\u201d) in the amount of $2,990. The Senior Note was placed pursuant to a third amendment to the original NPA dated as of November 1, 2010, by and among Orwell, NEO, and Brainard, and Great Plains, Lightning Pipeline, Gas Natural and Sun Life. The Senior Note has an interest rate of 4.15%, compounded semi-annually, and matures on June 1, 2017. The Senior Note is a joint obligation of the Ohio subsidiaries and is guaranteed by our non-regulated Ohio subsidiaries.\nThe Sun Life covenants restrict certain cash balances and requires a debt service reserve account to be maintained to cover approximately one year of interest payments. The total balance in the debt service reserve accounts was $948 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is included in restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt service reserve account cannot be used for operating cash needs.\nThe Fixed Rate Note and Senior Note contain various covenants, which include, among others, limitations on total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness, limitations on asset sales, and maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios as outlined below.\nThe amendments provide that any cash dividends, distributions, redemptions or repurchases of common stock may be made by the obligors to the holding company only if (i) the aggregate amount of all such dividends, distributions, redemptions and repurchases for the fiscal year do not exceed 70% of net income of the obligors for the four fiscal quarters then ending determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending, and (ii) there exists no other event of default at the time the dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase is made.\nThe Ohio subsidiaries are prohibited from creating, assuming or incurring additional indebtedness except for (i) obligations under certain financing agreements, (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500,000 at any one time outstanding, (iii) indebtedness outstanding as of March 31, 2011, (iv) certain unsecured intercompany indebtedness and (v) certain other indebtedness permitted under the notes.\nThe notes prohibit us from selling or otherwise transferring assets except in the ordinary course of business and to the extent such sales or transfers, in the aggregate, over each rolling twelve month period, do not exceed 1% of our total assets. Generally, we may consummate a merger or consolidation if there is no event of default and the provisions of the notes are assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation. We are also generally limited in making acquisitions in excess of 10% of our total assets. An event of default, if not cured, would require us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the notes as well as any and all interest and other payments due. An event of default would also entitle Sun Life to exercise certain rights with respect to the collateral that secures the indebtedness incurred under the notes.\nThe Fixed Rate Note requires an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis. The interest coverage ratio is measured with respect to the Obligors on a consolidated basis and also with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. The note generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA to gross interest expense. The note defines EBITDA as net income plus the sum of interest expense, any provision for federal, state, and local taxes, depreciation, and amortization determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but excluding any extraordinary non-operating income or loss and any gain or loss from non-operating transactions. The notes also require that we do not permit indebtedness to exceed 60% of capitalization at any time. Like the interest coverage ratio, the ratio of debt to capitalization is measured on a consolidated basis for the Obligors, and again on a consolidated basis with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries.\n 42 \nRing Fencing Restrictions\nIn addition to the financial covenants under our credit facilities, the ring fencing provisions required by our regulatory commissions impose additional limitations on our liquidity. Specifically, usage of the Bank of America line of credit is regulated by ring fencing provisions from the MPSC, MPUC and NCUC. One of the ring fencing provisions issued by the MPSC requires that of the $30,000 line of credit available, $11,200 must be used or available to be used exclusively by Energy West Montana. The remaining $18,800 balance of the line of credit is available for use by Energy West and its other Montana, North Carolina and Maine subsidiaries. Energy West and Energy West Montana are required to provide monthly financial reports to the MPSC. We continue to monitor our compliance under these ring fencing provisions on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2015, we had available $9,168 to be drawn on the Bank of America line of credit after giving effect to the $11,200 allocation to Energy West Montana.\nOn November 24, 2014, the MPSC issued an order directing, in part, that Energy West require Gas Natural to repay an intercompany payable to Energy West by December 24, 2014. In addition, the MPSC order restricted Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries from paying dividends to Gas Natural until persuasive evidence could be presented that Energy West was on a sound financial footing and that effect had been given to the MPSC's ring-fencing conditions; the strongest indication being the absence of ongoing balances owed to Energy West by Gas Natural. On April 9, 2015, Energy West filed a request to reinstate Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to Gas Natural. On July 22, 2015, the MPSC issued an order allowing for the reinstatement of the dividends. They also approved a special dividend to be declared from the proceeds from the sale of Energy West's subsidiaries EWW and Pipeline assets.\nRing fencing provisions also subject us to certain restrictions on our capital structure. The MPSC requires Energy West to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than 52%. The total restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries related to debt covenants and the ring fencing is $76,233, or 79.8% of our net assets of $95,489 as of December 31, 2015. We believe we are in compliance with all ring fencing provisions.\nCorporate Structural Revisions and Pending Financing Agreements\nIn February 2016, we proposed to create a wholly-owned subsidiary under which each of our nine regulated entities will be held. This will streamline our corporate structure to facilitate greater focus on the four regulatory jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as to simplify our financing arrangements. With the new structure, which is subject to regulatory approval, the regulated entities will be segregated from non-regulated operations. We also announced that we reached an agreement with our lenders to refinance and consolidate our debt within our parent company. The long-term debt agreements include proposed issuance of up to $50,000 of senior notes, with maturities and interest rates to be determined upon closing, subject to prevailing market conditions at that time. Additionally, we will establish a $42,000 five-year revolving credit facility and finance a lease buyout of approximately $7,000 over a term of four years. Closing on the debt agreements is subject to negotiation of terms, requested regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Upon closing, proceeds from the new debt facilities will replace our five existing loan facilities and provide additional cash for operational purposes.\n 43 \nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations that require cash payment over future periods at December 31, 2015, were as follows:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due in years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 - 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 - 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Line of credit (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Related party note payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Build-to-suit lease (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas purchase obligations (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Pipeline & storage capacity obligations (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The principle balance on our line of credit is not due until 2017, however due to its classification as a current liability it has been included as a contractual obligation due in 2016.\n(2) Build-to-suit lease is related to the third phase of our new ERP system, and will be evaluated for sale leaseback treatment upon its completion in 2016. The asset to be leased is not yet complete and as such actual amounts due may vary from the amounts presented.\n(3) Some of our natural gas purchase and capacity obligations are based on future market pricing. Cash payment estimates for these obligations are based on our price in effect as of December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOur recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future performance. However, future performance involves risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a natural gas company, primarily operating local distribution companies in four states and serving approximately 67,800 customers in total. Our natural gas utility subsidiaries are Bangor Gas Company (Maine), Brainard Gas Corp. (Ohio), Cut Bank Gas Company (Montana), Energy West Montana (Montana), Frontier Natural Gas (North Carolina), Northeast Ohio Natural Gas Corporation (Ohio) and Orwell Natural Gas Company (Ohio). Each of these entities is regulated in their respective states and operates under tariffs which allow them to collect revenue sufficient to recover their operating costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their rate base. Approximately 93%, 93% and 89%, of our revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were derived from our natural gas utility operations.\nOur operations also include the marketing and production of natural gas. Our marketing and production subsidiaries are Energy West Resources (Montana and Wyoming) and Gas Natural Resources (Ohio). Our marketing and production subsidiaries obtain gas from interstate pipelines, local producers, and from small production wells in which it owns an interest. This gas is then sold to regulated utilities, commercial and industrial customers that are the end users of the commodity. In 2015, our marketing and production subsidiaries marketed approximately 1.5 Bcf of natural gas in three states.\nAs part of this discussion and analysis of our operating results we refer to increases and decreases in heating degree days. A heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit. In any given period, sales volumes reflect the impact of weather, in addition to other factors. We do not have a weather normalization adjustment in our rates and as a result, our revenue is sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Colder temperatures generally result in increased sales, while warmer temperatures generally result in reduced sales.\nWe recorded gains on our discontinued operations during 2015 related to the sale of EWW of $4,869 and the sale of the Pipeline Assets of $499. The following summarizes the critical events that impacted our results of continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2015:\nGross margin decreased due to:\n \u00b7 the executed stipulation with the PUCO Staff in the second quarter of 2015, which related to the most recent gas cost recovery audits in Ohio and specified a disallowance of gas costs of $693 over amounts previously accrued, \n \u00b7 the lower sales volumes in our Montana market caused lower gross margin in 2015, compared to 2014, \n \u00b7 volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation in our North Carolina market were adjusted downward $234 in 2015, compared to 2014, \n \u00b7 an adjustment to deferred gas costs in our Clarion River and Walker Gas divisions in Ohio lowered gross margin by $184 in the third quarter of 2015, and \n \u00b7 a partially offsetting increase in gross margin in our Maine market due to the activation of the Loring pipeline and the higher sales volumes in 2015, compared to 2014. \nOperating expenses increased as a result of the following:\n \u00b7 increases related to personnel costs of $764, legal fees of $675, depreciation, amortization and accretion of $600, and property taxes of $192 in 2015 compared to 2014, \n \u00b7 we incurred operating expenses related to the implementation of our new ERP system, including general and administrative expense of $606, maintenance expense of $265 depreciation of $163 and interest expense of $237, and \n \u00b7 our provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $834 in 2015 compared to 2014, offsetting the increases in operating expenses listed above. In 2014 we wrote-off of uncollectible accounts of $1,056 related to the unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. \nIn addition, we recorded a net charge to other income of $335 for our loss on the disposals of assets at our Clarion, Walker and PGC utilities, and the sale of an office building in Mentor, Ohio.\n 23 \nWe are focused on building rate base profitably in all of our jurisdictions, maintaining cost discipline, adherence to safety standards, and generating recurring streams of earnings and cash flow that support our continued investment in fixed assets, as well as a return on capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\nGas Prices and Revenues\nDue to the price volatility of gas and our ability to pass our cost of gas on to our customers, we believe that revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in gas prices, our revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in sales volumes or gross margin. We consider gross margin to be a better measure of comparative performance than revenues. However, gas prices and revenues can impact our working capital requirements; see \"Operating Cash Flow\" below.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements. We analyze our estimates, including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process. Our regulated natural gas segment continues to be cost-of-service rate regulated, and we believe the application of ASC 980 - Regulated Operations to that segment continues to be appropriate. We must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date. If, as a result of a change in circumstances, we determine that the regulated natural gas segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under ASC 980, that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities.\nThe application of ASC 980 results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before we have received approval for recovery from the state regulatory agencies. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base this conclusion on certain factors, including changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies, and the status of any potential new legislation. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers. At December 31, 2015, our total regulatory assets were $3,992 and our total regulatory liabilities were $1,738. A write-off of our regulatory assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur natural gas segment contains regulated utility businesses in the states of Maine, Montana, North Carolina and Ohio, and the regulation varies from state to state. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, we would be required to charge these assets to current earnings. However, there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets. In addition, deregulation would be a change that occurs over time, due to legal processes and procedures, which could moderate the impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nA significant regulatory asset/liability relates to the recoverable/refundable costs of gas purchases. We account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies, under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes.\nOur gas cost recoveries are monitored closely by the regulatory commissions in all of the states in which we operate. The gas cost recoveries are adjusted monthly in three of the four states in which we operate, and semi-annually in the other one. In addition, all of the states in which we operate require us to submit gas procurement plans, which we closely follow. These plans are reviewed annually by each of the regulatory commissions. The adjustment of gas cost recoveries and the gas procurement plans reduce the risk of disallowance of recoverable gas costs. Based on our experience, we believe it is highly probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded.\n 24 \nWe use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory commissions, however, can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccumulated Provisions for Doubtful Accounts\nWe encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable. As such, we record a provision for those accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, we primarily utilize current conditions as well as historical bad debt write-offs as a percentage of aged receivables. The underlying assumptions used for the provision can change from period to period and the provision could potentially cause a material impact to our financial statements by overstating liquidity and over-valuing net worth. The actual weather, commodity prices, and other internal and external economic conditions, such as the mix of the customer base between residential, commercial and industrial, may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact our operating income.\nUnbilled Revenue and Gas Costs\nWe estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each meter reading cycle to the month end. This estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period. Unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end.\nEach month we record the estimated unbilled revenue amounts as revenue and a receivable, and we reverse the prior month's estimate. Likewise, we record associated gas costs as cost of revenue and a payable, and we reverse prior month's estimate. Actual price and usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact revenues recognized and costs recorded. The critical component of calculating unbilled revenue is estimating the usage on a calendar month basis. Our estimated volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation have varied from our actual monthly metered volumes by less than plus or minus 10% on December 31, 2015 and 2014. A 10% change in our unbilled revenue at December 31, 2015, would have impacted our gross margin by $177.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair values of marketable securities are estimated based on the closing share price on the quoted market price for those investments. The fair values of our derivative instruments are estimated based on the difference between the fixed commodity price designated in the agreement and the commodity futures price for the settlement period at the measurement date. The fair value measure of our contingent consideration liability has significant unobservable inputs, including our weighted average cost of capital, our credit spread above the risk free rate and our forecasted future cash flows. A significant increase (decrease) in these inputs could result in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value measure.\nDeferred Tax Asset and Income Tax Accruals\nJudgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes, regulations, and income tax examinations require that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process.\nWe have a deferred tax asset of approximately $5,700 as of December 31, 2015, related to the carryover tax basis of Frontier Utilities and Penobscot Natural Gas, which we acquired in 2007. The carryover tax basis is subject to the limitations in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limited our tax depreciation in tax years 2007 through 2012. We have approximately $14,676 of carryover tax basis remaining as of December 31, 2015, and will recognize potential future federal and state income tax benefits of approximately $5,700 over the remaining life of the carryover tax basis of the assets. For federal income tax purposes, we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will be realized in future reporting periods based on future taxable income projections. For state income tax purposes, we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will not be realized, due to state net operating loss carryovers and future state taxable income projections. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $1,564 on the state deferred tax assets associated with the carryover tax basis of our subsidiaries acquired in 2007.\nManagement reevaluates the valuation allowance annually based on future taxable income projections and adjusts our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets. If the projections indicate that we are unable to use all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, we will adjust the valuation allowance to income tax expense. Our valuation allowance is based on projections of our taxable income in future reporting years. Based on future taxable income projections, our state net operating losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $4,913 on our state deferred tax asset associated with state net operating losses.\n 25 \nFor the federal tax portion, the five year Internal Revenue Code limitation period discussed above expired in 2012. Based on our estimates of taxable income, we project that we will recover approximately 98% of the remaining benefit in the next eight years, with 2% recovered in small increments in the remaining years. Based on this analysis, we believe that a valuation allowance on the federal portion of the benefit is not necessary. Failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a write-down in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected and could also lead to the expiration of the deferred tax asset between now and 2029, either of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, rather, the goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, which we perform in the fourth quarter, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We test for goodwill impairment using a two-step approach. A recoverability test at the reporting unit level must be performed during the first step. If the asset is not recoverable, the second step calculates the impairment loss, if any. Our impairment evaluations as of December 31, 2015, indicated that our goodwill is fully recoverable. During 2015, we sold the assets of our PGC subsidiary and recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $284 based on the carrying value of our assets and our estimated costs to sell the assets, which is included in the computation of our loss on the sale of PGC. See Note 6- Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nThe schedule below shows the goodwill balances allocated to our Ohio and GNR subsidiaries as well as the excess of their fair values over their carrying values as of December 31, 2015, if any:\n\nThere is a degree of uncertainty related to assumptions used to determine fair value. There are estimates and assumptions for organic growth, market equity risk, realized return on equity investments, market multiples, risk premium for size, weighted average cost of capital, capital structure, and tax rate. Weather can negatively impact our key assumptions and results.\nWhen testing goodwill impairment of our subsidiaries, the enterprise value calculations were determined by putting an equal emphasis on a discounted cash flow method and a guideline public company method. The key assumptions made for each approach used in the impairment testing were (1) weighted average cost of capital of 7.0-13.5%; (2) perpetuity growth rate of 2.5%; and (3) operating EBITDA forecasts. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from these impairment tests.\nLease Commitments\nEach time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects whether and how the transaction is reflected in our balance sheet, as well as our recognition of rental payments as rent or interest expense. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and residual value of leased properties, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows that may be realized from the leased properties. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. Other aspects of our lease accounting policies relate to the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions, including the appropriate amortization any deferred gains or losses. Our lease accounting policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations and estimated useful lives. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not known at the time of our previous assessments, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties that we lease, result in a change in classification of some of our leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets.\n 26 \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax -The 2015 and 2014 results of our EWW subsidiary, historically included in the Natural Gas Operations segment, and the results of our pipeline operations segment have also been classified as discontinued operations as a result of a sale agreement executed on October 10, 2014. In addition, the 2015 and 2014 results of our propane operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the assets of Independence in November 2013. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail. Our income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 was $3,519 or $0.34 per share, compared to $1,033 or $0.10 per share for 2014. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2015 primarily consisted of a net gain recorded on the sale of EWW of $4,869 and the net gain for the sale of the Pipeline Assets of $499.\nIncome from continuing operations - Income from continuing operations for 2015 was $1,169, or $0.11 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $2,729 or $0.26 per share for 2014. Income from continuing operations decreased by $1,560 primarily due to: 1) increases in personnel related costs of $764 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor; 2) increased legal fees of $675 related to our ongoing legal matters; 3) increases in our expenses related to the implementation of our new ERP system, including operating expenses of $871, depreciation of $163 and interest expense of $237; 4) a charge of $693 in the second quarter of 2015 for additional disallowed gas cost beyond amounts accrued from the stipulation with the PUCO Staff in the most recent gas cost recovery audit in Ohio; and 5) an offsetting increase to revenues from the Loring pipeline, customer growth and colder weather in our Maine market. Loss from our gas marketing and production operations decreased by $1,320, primarily as a result of a decrease in bad debt expense of $834 during 2015 because during the 2014 period because our marketing operation in Montana wrote-off $1,056 of uncollectible receivables resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, we experienced a decrease of $1,131 in our income tax expenses based on our income before taxes, which declined for the reasons listed above. Loss from our corporate and other segment decreased by $136, primarily as a result of a decrease in our operating expenses of $534 that occurred because distribution, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our EWW subsidiary were reallocated to corporate in 2014 when we reclassified that subsidiary as discontinued operations.\n 27 \nRevenues - Revenues decreased by $20,209 to $112,361 during 2015 compared to $132,570 during 2014. Revenue from natural gas operations decreased by $19,075 due primarily to: 1) a decrease in the price of natural gas passed through to our customers in our Ohio, North Carolina and Montana markets; 2) decreased sales volumes due to warmer weather in our Montana market; 3) a decrease of $534 related to a downward adjustment to volumes used to calculate unbilled revenue in our North Carolina market in 2015, and partially offset by; 4) increases in revenue in Maine of $1,775 and $527 for transportation services to customers and the Loring pipeline, respectively. Our Loring pipeline began transportation services in September 2014. Revenue from our marketing and production operation decreased by $1,134 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition and significantly lower prices for volumes produced in our production operation.\nGross margin - Gross margin decreased by $617 to $44,235 for 2015 compared to $44,852 for 2014. Our natural gas operation's margins decreased $358, due primarily to: 1) a charge of $693 recorded in the second quarter of 2015 for additional disallowed gas cost beyond amounts accrued from the PUCO Staff stipulation in the gas cost recovery audit in Ohio; 2) lower sales in our Montana market due to warmer weather; 3) volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation in our North Carolina market were adjusted downward $234 in 2015, compared to 2014, and partially offset by; 4) increased margin from the Loring pipeline and customer growth and colder weather in our Maine market. Gross margin from our marketing & production operations decreased $259, primarily due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition and the lower prices for volumes produced in our production operation.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses increased by $1,474 to $39,227 for 2015 compared to $37,753 for the same period in 2014. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased $1,456 primarily due an increases in personnel related costs of $764 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor, and we experienced increased legal fees of $675. Additionally, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $248 for training related to our new ERP system and we recorded amortization of a deferred loss on the sale-leaseback transaction for our ERP system of $358. These increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease of $824 in other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $600 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $245 related to our regulatory asset in Frontier and as a result of an increase of $163 related to our ERP system assets placed in service during 2015. Taxes other than income increased by $192 due to property tax increases. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased $834 during 2015 because during the 2014 period, our marketing operation in Montana wrote-off $1,056 of uncollectible receivables resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nOther income (expense) - Other income (expense) decreased by $222 to $182 for 2015 compared to $404 for 2014. During 2015, changes in other income were the result of: 1) a net loss on the disposals of our Clarion, Walker, PGC and 8500 Station Street assets of $335; 2) a decrease in rental income of $156; 3) a decrease of approximately $132 in management fee income that we earned for operating natural gas facilities for third parties, and; 4) a decrease in interest income of $150 due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market in 2014 that did not recur in 2015. These decreases in other income (expense) were partially offset by a charge in 2014 to impair our investment in Kykuit, which did not recur in 2015, and as a result in unrealized gains on our commodity swap contracts.\nInterest expense - The following table presents changes in our interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our interest expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the completion and implementation of our build-to-suit ERP system and the related capital lease payments, and as a result of debt issue costs related to our short term loans with NIL Funding.\n\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense decreased by $1,131 to $417 for 2015 compared to $1,548 for 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in our income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% for 2015 compared to 39.3% for 2014 as a result of a change in the proportion of our pre-tax income by state.\n 28 \nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013\n\nRevenues - Revenues increased by $23,170 to $132,570 for 2014 compared to $109,400 for 2013. In our natural gas operation segment, the $25,820 increase was attributable to 1) colder weather in the majority of the markets we serve leading to a higher consumption of natural gas, 2) higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers of our regulated subsidiaries, and 3) growth in our customer base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $2,650 from our marketing and production segment. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $4,778 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in April 2014. Revenue from our western marketing operations decreased by $293 due to lower sales volumes. Offsetting these is the increase in revenue from our GNR subsidiary of $2,341 representing a full year of operations and the revenue increase from our production operation of $80.\nGross margin - Gross margin increased by $1,482 to $44,852 for 2014 compared to $43,370 for 2013. Our natural gas operations segment's margin increased $2,700 due to increased sales volumes from continued customer growth in Maine, North Carolina and Ohio, amplified by colder weather in all of our markets. Gross margin from our marketing and production segment decreased $1,218 primarily due to higher costs of natural gas used to supply fixed price sales contracts, the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline completion, and the loss of NEO and Orwell as customers. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses increased by $6,135 to $37,753 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $31,618 for the prior year period. Distribution, general and administrative expense increased by $3,462 due to 1) increased legal fees of $1,868 stemming primarily from the legal proceedings discussed in Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report; 2) an increase of $569 in consulting and auditing fees related to improving and testing our internal control environment; 3) increases in corporate payroll and benefits of $564; and 4) the write-off of $336 of construction work in progress relating to a software conversion project that has been terminated. Depreciation expense increased by $1,048 due to higher capital expenditures and the amortization of the regulatory asset by Frontier of $245. Taxes other than income increased by $255 primarily due to higher property, payroll and other taxes in our Ohio subsidiaries. The 2014 period included $1,056 in the provision for doubtful accounts resulting from a ruling against us in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Receivables in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail. The 2014 period included a net unrealized holding loss of $62 related to the earn-out provision in the JDOG Marketing purchase, compared to a net unrealized holding gain of $1,565 in 2013. These increases were partially offset by a $726 impairment to goodwill in the 2013 period.\n 29 \nOther income (expense) - Other income (expense) increased by $104 to $404 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $300 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $184 gain on the sale of marketable securities, a decrease in acquisition expense of $265 year over year, a decrease of $309 in S-3 costs and an increase in interest income of $172. This was partially offset by a $350 loss related to the impairment of our Kykuit investment and a $151 loss on derivative assets.\nInterest expense - Interest expense increased $50 to $3,226 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $3,176 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This change was primarily due to an increase of $4,410 in the average outstanding principle balances on our line of credit that is almost entirely offset by a decrease of $2,472 in the average outstanding principle balances on our notes payable and a decrease in average LIBOR, the basis for our floating interest rates, during the year.\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense decreased by $1,476 to $1,548 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3,024 for the same period in 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income from continuing operations. In addition, the 2014 and 2013 periods each included a tax benefit from the true-up to the prior year's tax return of $71 and $103, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 39.3% for 2014 and 37.5% for 2013. The 2013 period included a tax benefit of $336 related to a change in the state effective tax rates as discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax - The 2014 and 2013 results of our EWW subsidiary, pipeline operations segment, and propane operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding this topic.\n 30 \nNATURAL GAS OPERATIONS\nIncome Statement\n\nOperating Revenues\n\nUtility throughput\n\n 31 \nYear Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nHeating Degree Days\nA heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues decreased by $19,075 to $103,978 for 2015 compared to $123,053 for 2014. This decrease is the result of the following factors:\n 1) Revenues from our Ohio market decreased $8,046. Revenue to full service customers decreased $7,942, primarily due to lower prices paid for natural gas passed on to our customers, along with a decrease of volumes sold to full service customers of 222 MMcf due to warmer weather. \n 2) Revenue from our Montana market decreased $6,533 primarily caused by a volume decrease of 474 MMcf during 2015 compared to 2014, due to warmer weather in 2015. A decrease in prices paid for natural gas passed on to our customers also contributed to the decreased revenue. \n 3) Revenue from our North Carolina market decreased by $3,332 due to 1) the $534 decrease from the adjustment to sales volumes used in our unbilled revenue calculation in the second quarter of 2015; 2) lower prices paid for natural gas passed through to customers; and 3) a decrease in sales volumes of 192 MMcf due to warmer weather. \n 4) We sold our PGC assets during 2015, and revenue from our Kentucky market where PGC operated decreased $466 during 2015 compared to 2014. \n 5) Revenue from our Maine market decreased $698. The decrease from 2014 is due to price decreases and a volume decrease of 59 MMcf, or $3,000 from full service customers. This decrease was offset by an increase of $1,775 for transportation services to customers and an increase in revenue of $527 from the Loring pipeline, which began transportation services in September 2014. \nGas purchases decreased by $18,717 to $60,380 for 2015, compared to $79,097 for 2014. This decrease is primarily due to lower gas costs passed through to customers in our Ohio, North Carolina and Montana markets as well as decreases in sales volumes in our Montana markets. In addition to lower gas costs, the following items impacted our 2015 gas purchases: 1) in the second quarter of 2015, we recorded $693 for additional disallowed gas costs over amounts previously accrued from the PUCO Staff stipulation in the gas cost recovery audit in Ohio, and 2) in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a $184 adjustment to gas costs in our Clarion River and Walker Gas divisions. Our gas costs are passed on dollar for dollar to our customers under tariffs regulated by the various commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gas costs are subject to periodic audits and prudency reviews in all of these jurisdictions.\nGross margin decreased by $358 to $43,598 for 2015 compared to $43,956 for 2014. Gross margin in our Ohio market decreased by $546, as a result of an adjustment for $693 of additional disallowed gas cost in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin in our Montana markets decreased by $352 due to lower sales volumes caused by warmer weather. Gross margin in our North Carolina market decreased by $442 due to the $234 adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 to decrease the lower volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation and as a result of lower sales volumes noted above. Kentucky decreased gross margin by $179. Partially offsetting these, gross margin in our Maine market increased by $1,161 due to the startup of the Loring pipeline and more favorable pricing arrangements.\n 32 \nEarnings\nThe natural gas operations segment's net income for 2015 was $3,476 or $0.33 per share, compared to earnings of $6,492, or $0.62 per share for 2014.\nOperating expenses increased by $3,672 to $35,746 for 2015 compared to $32,074 for 2014. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased by $2,576 due to: 1) increases in personnel related expenses of $1,029 that occurred because we had fewer projects under construction during 2015, and therefore capitalized less labor; and 2) increases in expenses of $248 for training related to our new ERP system and we recorded amortization of a deferred loss on the sale-leaseback transaction for our ERP system of $354. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $699, of which $245 was a result of increased amortization of a regulatory asset at Frontier and $161 was a result of our ERP system placed in service during 2015. Taxes other than income increased by $206 due to increased property taxes. Increases in our depreciation and property taxes are a result of additions to our plant, property and equipment during 2014 and 2015.\nOther income decreased by $743 to $147 for 2015 compared to $890 for 2014. We experienced a decrease in rental income of $156, a decrease of approximately $132 in management fee income that we earned for operating natural gas facilities for third parties, and interest income decreased by $150 due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $1,920 to $1,741 for 2015 compared to $3,661 for 2014, primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income in 2015 compared to the 2014 period.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013\nHeating Degree Days\nA heating degree day is a measure of coldness of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues increased by $25,820 to $123,053 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $97,233 for the same period in 2013. This increase is the result of the following factors:\n 1) Revenue from our Montana market increased $4,740 on a volume increase of 298 MMcf in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to colder weather and higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers. \n 2) Revenue from our Ohio market increased by $6,240. Revenue from full service customers increased $6,011 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers and a volume increase of 492 MMcf resulting from a 5% increase in customers and colder weather. \n 3) Revenue from our Maine and North Carolina markets increased $14,527 on a volume increase from full service and transportation customers of 153 MMcf in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher prices for natural gas passed through to customers and customer growth of 20%. The increase in the volumes from customer growth was offset by the loss of a large customer in our Maine market in the last half of 2014. The Loring pipeline, which began serving customers in October 2014 added $145 of additional revenue. \n 4) Revenue from our Kentucky markets increased $311 on a volume increase from full service residential customers of 30 MMcf in 2014 compared to 2013 due to colder weather and 4.5% customer growth. \n 33 \nGas purchased increased by $23,120 to $79,097 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $55,977 in 2013. The increase is due to higher prices for natural gas in 2014 compared to 2013 combined with the higher volume throughput for our full service distribution customers. Related to the in-progress PUCO audit of our gas cost recovery mechanisms in Ohio, included in the 2014 results is a true-up of $(301) to the accrual contained in the 2013 disallowance amount, offset by additional disallowed gas costs in 2014 of $987 for a net charge of $686. Included in the 2013 results is a charge of $1,502 for the disallowance of gas costs resulting from a previous gas cost recovery audit by the PUCO.\nGross margin increased by $2,700 to $43,956 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $41,256 for the same period in 2013 due to customer growth in our Maine, North Carolina and Ohio markets and colder weather in all of our service territories. Ohio accounted for $2,188 of the increase, Maine and North Carolina for $862, and Kentucky for $131. These increases in margin were offset partially by a decrease in margin in our Montana natural gas operations of $481.\nEarnings\nThe natural gas operations segment's income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $6,492, or $0.62 per share, compared to $6,821, or $0.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOperating expenses increased by $2,681 to $32,074 for 2014, compared to $29,393 for 2013. Distribution, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,326 due primarily to the increases in allocations of corporate expenses related to the hiring of new corporate personnel and to improving and auditing our internal control environment. Depreciation expense increased $989 due to the increased capital expenditures and the amortization of the regulatory asset in Frontier of $245. Other taxes increased $279 due primarily to increased property and payroll taxes in our Ohio subsidiaries.\nOther income increased by $123 to $890 for 2014 compared to $767 for 2013. Interest income increased by $176 primarily due to interest income allowed on deferred gas costs in our North Carolina market. Gains on disposal of property decreased $39 for 2014 compared to 2013. Income from service sales in 2014 decreased by $62 compared to 2013. Additionally, we had no acquisition related costs in 2014, compared to $47 related to the purchase of an office building asset in 2013.\nInterest expense increased by $53 to $2,619 for 2014 compared to $2,566 for 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased borrowing on the line of credit resulting in $134 of additional interest expense and $51 of increased interest expense related to the change in estimate of the recoverable purchased gas costs in our Ohio markets. Partially offsetting these increases, the payoff of the senior secured guaranteed floating rate note on May 3, 2014, resulted in $83 less interest. In addition, decreased principal balances on our debt and capital lease obligation resulted in $15 and $38 less interest, respectively, compared to 2013.\nIncome tax expense increased by $418 to $3,661 for 2014 compared to $3,243 for 2013 due primarily to the increase in pre-tax income. Both 2014 and 2013 included a true-up of the prior year's tax return for a benefit of $75 and $95, respectively. The 2013 period included a tax benefit related to a change in the state effective tax rates as discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\n 34 \nMarketing & Production\nIncome Statement\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues decreased by $1,134 to $8,383 for 2015 compared to $9,517 for 2014. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $1,389 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in 2014. Our GNR subsidiary contributed revenue of $3,222, which is a decrease of $1,067 from 2014 due primarily to lower prices charged to customers. Revenue from our production operation decreased by $501 due to significantly lower prices for volumes produced. Offsetting these is an increase in revenue from our EWR marketing operation by $1,823 due primarily to the sales of gas to EWW after that entity was sold to Cheyenne.\nGross margin decreased by $259 to $637 for 2015 compared to $896 for 2014. Gross margin from our LNG business decreased by $213 as a result of the loss of our LNG customer. Gross margin from our EWR production operation decreased by $180 due the lower prices on volumes produced. Gross margin on EWR marketing operations increased by $69 due to higher margins per unit on volumes sold.\nEarnings\nThe marketing and production segment's loss for 2015 was $113, or $0.01 per share, compared to a loss of $1,433, or $0.14 per share for 2014.\nOperating expenses decreased by $1,664 to $814 for 2015 compared to $2,478 for 2014. Our professional fees expenses declined by $261 during 2015, as compared to 2014. Additionally, during 2014, we wrote off $1,056 in uncollectible accounts expense resulting from an unfavorable ruling in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nOther income (expense) increased by $605 to income of $103 for 2015 compared to expense of $502 for 2014, because in 2014 we impaired our investment in Kykuit, which did not recur in 2015, and as a result of an increase in unrealized gains on our commodity swap contracts.\nIncome tax benefit decreased by $676 to $96 for 2015 compared to $772 for 2014, primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income in 2015, compared to 2014.\n 35 \nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nRevenues decreased by $2,650 to $9,517 for 2014 compared to $12,167 for 2013. Revenue from our LNG business decreased by $4,778 due to the loss of our LNG customer to pipeline competition in 2014. Revenues from our existing gas marketing operation decreased by $294, due primarily to lower sales volumes. Offsetting these, our GNR subsidiary's revenue increased by $2,342 as a result of its first full year in operation and revenue from our production operation increased by $80.\nGross margin decreased by $1,218 to $896 for 2014 compared to $2,114 for 2013. Gross margin from our gas marketing operation decreased by $630 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher costs of natural gas used to supply fixed price sales contracts, and the lower sales volumes. Gross margin from our LNG business decreased by $329 and GNR's margin decreased by $250 in 2014 due to the loss NEO and Orwell as customers. Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details. Margin from our production operation decreased by $9.\nEarnings\nThe marketing and production segment's loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1,433, or $0.14 per share, compared to income of $1,036, or $0.12 per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOperating expenses increased by $1,977 to $2,478 for 2014, compared to $501 for 2013. Our GNR subsidiary was responsible for $1,053 of increased expenses in 2014, compared to 2013. The 2014 period included a full year of operating results, compared to seven months of 2013. The year ended December 31, 2013, included an unrealized holding gain on the contingent consideration liability of $1,565, partially offset by a goodwill impairment expense of $726. Expenses from our existing western marketing and production operations increased by $925 due primarily to the increase in bad debt expense of $1,056, resulting from a ruling against us in a large industrial customer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Receivables in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further detail.\nOther income decreased by $653 to a loss of $502 for 2014, compared to income of $151 for 2013. During 2014, we recorded an expense of $350 related to the impairment of our investment in Kykuit. See Note 7 - Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. During 2014, we also recorded a mark to market loss of $151 related to natural gas swap contracts and the 2013 period includes a gain on the sale of compressed natural gas equipment of $154.\nInterest expense decreased by $21 to an expense of $121 for 2014 compared to expense of $142 for 2013.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $1,358 to a benefit of $772 for 2014 compared to expense of $586 for the same period in 2013. Both 2014 and 2013 each included a tax benefit from the true-up to the prior year's tax return of $8 and $6 respectively, accounting for a decrease in expense of $2. The remaining decrease is due primarily to the decrease in pre-tax income.\n 36 \nCorporate & Other\nOur corporate and other reporting segment is intended primarily to encompass the results of corporate acquisitions, other equity transactions, and certain other income and expense items associated with our holding company functions as well as the results of our discontinued operations. Therefore, it does not have standard revenues, gas purchase costs, or gross margin.\nIncome Statement\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nResults of our corporate and other segment for the year ended December 31, 2015, include administrative costs of $2,667, interest expense of $687, corporate expenses of $68, offset by an income tax benefit of $1,228, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,194, or $0.21 per share. Loss from our corporate and other segment from continuing operations decreased by $136, primarily as a result of a decrease in our operating expenses of $534 that occurred because distribution, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our EWW subsidiary were reallocated to corporate in 2014 when we reclassified that subsidiary as discontinued operations.\nResults of our corporate and other segment for the year ended December 31, 2014, include administrative costs of $3,201, interest expense of $486, a gain on marketable securities of $184, acquisition related costs of $7, corporate expenses of $171, offset by an income tax benefit of $1,341, and interest and other income of $10, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,330, or $0.22 per share.\nResults of corporate and other operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, include administrative costs of $1,724, acquisition related costs of $225, costs related to expenses for our former chief executive officer's stock sale of $309, corporate expenses of $98, interest expense of $468, offset by an income tax benefit of $805, and interest and other income of $14, for a loss from continuing operations of $2,005, or $0.21 per share.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the sale of our Independence subsidiary in 2013 and the sale of our EWW subsidiary and Glacier & Shoshone pipelines in 2015, the results of the operations for these items have been reclassified to discontinued operations in our corporate and other operating segment. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding these sales.\n 37 \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn the ordinary course of operations, we incur expenses for natural gas purchases, general and administrative expenses, and pipeline construction purchases from companies owned or controlled by Richard M. Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer. For more information, see Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding all of our related party transactions.\nCapital Sources and Liquidity\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our operating and financing expenses and to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are:\n \u00b7 our cash balance; \n \u00b7 our operating cash flow; \n \u00b7 our revolving credit facility; \n \u00b7 our potential to borrow from related parties, as further described below under the heading Financing Cash Flow\u201d; \n \u00b7 our potential to issue debt and equity securities; and \n \u00b7 our potential to finance or sell assets we own. \nWe believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are:\n \u00b7 our ability to refinance our credit facility that matures in April 2017; \n \u00b7 decreased demand for our natural gas as a result of competition in our markets; \n \u00b7 the negative impact on our working capital requirements of volatile natural gas prices and the potential for natural gas prices to increase; \n \u00b7 decreased demand for natural gas used for heating as a result of warmer than average temperatures; and \n \u00b7 decreased demand for natural gas used for heating as a result of increased energy efficiency in new homes and appliances. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nOperating activities provide our primary source of cash and are supplemented by our revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $2,728 and $1,586 of cash on hand, respectively. The results of our EWW and Independence subsidiaries and Glacier & Shoshone pipeline operations are presented separately as discontinued operations. We do not expect the disposition of these subsidiaries and assets to have a material negative impact on our liquidity.\nOur ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), which had a balance of $15,750 and $28,761 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the balance of our revolving line of credit is primarily a result of our cash proceeds from the sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, as well as decreased capital expenditures in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nDuring 2015, we entered into two short term loan agreements with NIL Funding. On October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments to NIL Funding and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity. We made a principal payment of $1,000 on the note during December 2015. On April 6, 2015, we entered into a $5,000 loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding that had a maturity date of October 3, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished. NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nWe made capital expenditures of $9,567, $21,613 and $23,517 for 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively. We finance our capital expenditures by the use of our operating cash flow and our Bank of America revolving line of credit. Long-term debt was $39,721 and $40,263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including the amounts due within one year.\n 38 \n\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash provided by operating activities was $9,424, $11,146 and $15,439 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in the price of natural gas and lower sales volumes, which caused a $6,482 decrease in cash outflows from accounts payable as a result of less accounts payable outstanding at the end of 2015, compared to 2014, partially offset by a $2,184 increase in cash received from accounts receivable and $1,697 increase in cash received from natural gas and propane inventory as a result of lower balances outstanding at the end of 2015, compared to 2014. Major items affecting operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 include: a decrease in income from continuing operations of $3,123, a $2,977 increase in our net regulatory assets and liabilities, a $2,528 decrease in unbilled revenue, a $1,458 increase in payments of other liabilities, a $1,296 increase in accounts receivable collections, a $1,294 increase in accounts payable payments, and a $1,100 increase in prepayments.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $4,195, $18,679 and $20,192 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The changes in our cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by our cash used for capital expenditures and partially offset by cash provided by contributions in aid of construction.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures totaled $9,567, $21,613 and $23,517 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of our capital spending is focused on the growth of our natural gas operations segment. We conduct ongoing construction activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion, maintenance, and enhancement of our gas pipeline systems. We are actively expanding our systems in North Carolina and Maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service in those service areas. Capital expenditures for 2015 and 2014 included $1,482 and $948 in capital expenditures related to our new ERP system that were not financed under a lease agreement. Additionally, in 2013 we purchased an office building in Mentor, Ohio for $1,853, which amount is included in our capital expenditures.\nThe table below presents our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and provides our estimate of cash requirements for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\n 39 \nWe have budgeted for $4,707 of capital expenditures in 2016 in our natural gas operations segment, which will primarily focus on the continued expansion of our natural gas utilities service areas. These expenditures will have an emphasis on our Maine, North Carolina and Ohio markets.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nCash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $19,303 and $5,003, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities was $12,485 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Major items affecting financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 include: a net increase of $17,242 in the repayment of our line of credit, a net increase in borrowings from notes payable of $4,921, and an increase of $1,667 in payments of capital lease obligations. Major items affecting financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 include: a $16,721 decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common shares, a $3,561 net increase in proceeds from the line of credit, a $2,830 net increase in the repayment of our notes payable, a $653 increase in payments of dividends, and $617 decrease in the release of restricted cash balances.\nHistorically, to the extent that cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our expenditure requirements, including costs of gas purchased and capital expenditures, we have used our revolving line of credit. In general, our short-term borrowing needs for purchases of gas inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short-term borrowing needs for financing customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months. The cash flow from our business is seasonal and the line of credit balance in December normally represents the high point of borrowings in our annual cash flow cycle. Generally, our cash flow increases and our borrowings decrease, beginning in January, as monthly heating bills are paid and the gas we paid for and placed in storage in the summer months is used to supply our customers. Our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, which had a balance of $15,750 and $28,761 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, we had a short-term note payable with a principal balance of $2,000 with NIL Funding. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short term borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, was 2.95%, 2.45%, and 2.42%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on our current borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 2.71% and 2.44%, respectively. We periodically repay our short-term borrowings under the Bank of America revolving line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long-term debt and equity securities. Long-term debt was $39,721 and $40,263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including the amounts due within one year.\nBank of America Credit Agreement and Line of Credit\nOur Energy West subsidiary has a credit facility with the Bank of America ( Credit Facility\u201d) that provides for a revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of $30,000, due April 1, 2017. On November 26, 2014, we entered into an amendment temporarily increasing the borrowing capacity by $10,000 to a maximum of $40,000 until July 1, 2015, and the additional capacity was repaid prior to that date. The MPSC restricted draws on the line of credit to only Energy West and its subsidiary companies. This revolving credit facility includes an annual commitment fee ranging from 25 to 45 basis points of the unused portion of the facility and accrues interest based on our option of two indices - a base rate, which is defined as a daily rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or the daily LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, or LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points. At December 31, 2015, we did not have any base rate borrowings.\nOur average borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $19,838 and $23,397, respectively. The maximum borrowings were $30,911 and $31,061 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which balances occurred during the first and fourth quarters of the year, respectively. The minimum borrowings were $15,750 and $19,061 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which balances occurred during the third and second quarters of the year, respectively. Total borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $15,750 and $28,761, and bore interest at a weighted average outstanding rate of 2.17% and 2.44%, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. After considering outstanding letters of credit of $155, a total of $14,095 was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, Energy West has a $10,000 term loan with Bank of America with a maturity date of April 1, 2017 (the \"Term Loan\"). The Term Loan portion of the Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points and contains an interest rate swap provision that allows for the interest rate to be fixed in the future, but we have not exercised that provision. The Term Loan amortizes at a rate of $125 per quarter. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Term Loan bore interest at 2.17%, and had a balance of $8,375 and $8,875, respectively.\nThe Bank of America revolving credit agreement and term loan contain various covenants, which include limitations on total dividends and distributions, limitations on investments in other entities, maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios, and restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined below.\n 40 \nThe credit facility restricts Energy West's ability to pay dividends and make distributions, redemptions and repurchases of stock during the preceding 60-month period to 80% of its net income over that period. In addition, no event of default may exist at the time such dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase is made.\nThe credit facility limits investments in another entity by acquisition of any debt or equity securities or assets or by making loans or advances to such entity. Energy West is also prohibited from consummating a merger or consolidation or selling all or substantially all of its assets or stock except for (i) any merger, consolidation or sale by or with certain of its subsidiaries, (ii) any such purchase or other acquisition by Energy West or certain of its subsidiaries and (iii) sales and dispositions of assets for at least fair market value so long as the net book value of all assets sold or otherwise disposed of in any fiscal year does not exceed 5% of the net book value of Energy West's assets as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year.\nEnergy West must maintain a total debt-to-capital ratio of not more than .55-to-1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.0-to-1.0. The credit facility restricted Energy West's ability to create, incur or assume indebtedness except (i) indebtedness under the credit facility (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases including the capital lease related to the Loring pipeline, and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500, (iii) certain indebtedness of Energy West's subsidiaries, (iv) certain subordinated indebtedness, (v) certain hedging obligations and (vi) other indebtedness not to exceed $1,000.\nNIL Funding\nOn October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. The note bears interest at an annual rate of 6.95% and matures on April 20, 2016. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments to NIL Funding and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity. We made a principal payment of $1,000 on the note during December 2015. Our loan agreement with NIL Funding restricts our ability to incur additional borrowings, make new investments, consummate a merger or acquisition and dispose of assets. In an event of default, as defined under the loan agreement, NIL Funding may, at its option, require us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the note as well as any and all interest and other payments due or convert any part of the amounts due and unpaid to shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 95% of the previous day's closing price on the NYSE MKT. NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nOn April 6, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding. Pursuant to the note and loan agreement, NIL Funding loaned Gas Natural $5,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 7.5%, and a maturity date of October 3, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished.\nSenior Unsecured Notes of Energy West\nOn June 29, 2007, Energy West authorized the sale of $13,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.16% Senior Unsecured Notes with Allstate/CUNA, due June 29, 2017. In connection with our sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to repay the portion of notes payable to Allstate/CUNA that was allocated to EWW and EWD on February 12, 2016, including a prepayment penalty of $310. Additionally, we wrote off the unamortized debt issue costs that were allocated to EWW and EWD's portion of the debt, totaling $103. These amounts were recognized within discontinued operations, net of tax on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our discontinued operations.\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes contain various covenants, which include limitations on Energy West's total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined below, maintenance of certain interest coverage ratios, and limitations on asset sales as outlined below.\nThe credit facility limits Energy West's total dividends and distributions made in the immediately preceding 60-month period to 100% of aggregate consolidated net income for such period.\nThe notes restrict Energy West from incurring additional senior indebtedness in excess of 65% of capitalization at any time.\nThe credit facility also requires Energy West to maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than 150% of the pro forma annual interest charges on a consolidated basis in two of the three preceding fiscal years.\nEnergy West is prohibited from selling or otherwise disposing of any of its property or assets except (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) property or assets that are no longer usable in its business or (iii) property or assets transferred between Energy West and its subsidiaries if the aggregate net book value of all properties and assets so disposed of during the twelve month period next preceding the date of such sale or disposition would constitute more than 15% of the aggregate book value of all Energy West's tangible assets. In addition, Energy West may only consummate a merger or consolidation, dissolve or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets (i) if there is no event of default, (ii) the provisions of the notes are assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation and such entity further agrees that it will continue to operate its facilities as part of a system comprising a public utility regulated by the MPSC or another federal or state agency or authority and (iii) the surviving or continuing corporation has a net worth immediately subsequent to such acquisition, consolidation or merger equal to or greater than $10,000.\n 41 \nSun Life Assurance Company of Canada\nOn May 2, 2011, we and our Ohio subsidiaries, NEO, Orwell and Brainard, issued a $15,334, 5.38% Senior Secured Guaranteed Fixed Rate Note due June 1, 2017 (\"Fixed Rate Note\"). Additionally, Great Plains issued a $3,000, Senior Secured Guaranteed Floating Rate Note that was repaid on May 3, 2014. Payments for these notes prior to maturity are interest-only.\nEach of the notes is governed by a Note Purchase Agreement ( NPA\u201d). Concurrent with the funding and closing of the notes, which occurred on May 3, 2011, the parties executed amended note purchase agreements.\nThe Fixed Rate Note is a joint obligation of our holding company and our Ohio subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by Gas Natural Inc., Lightning Pipeline and Great Plains (together with the Ohio subsidiaries, the Obligors\u201d). Prepayment of this note prior to maturity is subject to a 50 basis point make-whole premium. This note received approval from the PUCO on March 30, 2011. The note is governed by a note purchase agreement. Under the note purchase agreement, we are required to make monthly interest payments and the principal is due at maturity.\nOn October 24, 2012, Orwell, NEO, and Brainard issued a Senior Secured Guaranteed Note ( Senior Note\u201d) in the amount of $2,990. The Senior Note was placed pursuant to a third amendment to the original NPA dated as of November 1, 2010, by and among Orwell, NEO, and Brainard, and Great Plains, Lightning Pipeline, Gas Natural and Sun Life. The Senior Note has an interest rate of 4.15%, compounded semi-annually, and matures on June 1, 2017. The Senior Note is a joint obligation of the Ohio subsidiaries and is guaranteed by our non-regulated Ohio subsidiaries.\nThe Sun Life covenants restrict certain cash balances and requires a debt service reserve account to be maintained to cover approximately one year of interest payments. The total balance in the debt service reserve accounts was $948 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is included in restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt service reserve account cannot be used for operating cash needs.\nThe Fixed Rate Note and Senior Note contain various covenants, which include, among others, limitations on total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness, limitations on asset sales, and maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios as outlined below.\nThe amendments provide that any cash dividends, distributions, redemptions or repurchases of common stock may be made by the obligors to the holding company only if (i) the aggregate amount of all such dividends, distributions, redemptions and repurchases for the fiscal year do not exceed 70% of net income of the obligors for the four fiscal quarters then ending determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending, and (ii) there exists no other event of default at the time the dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase is made.\nThe Ohio subsidiaries are prohibited from creating, assuming or incurring additional indebtedness except for (i) obligations under certain financing agreements, (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500,000 at any one time outstanding, (iii) indebtedness outstanding as of March 31, 2011, (iv) certain unsecured intercompany indebtedness and (v) certain other indebtedness permitted under the notes.\nThe notes prohibit us from selling or otherwise transferring assets except in the ordinary course of business and to the extent such sales or transfers, in the aggregate, over each rolling twelve month period, do not exceed 1% of our total assets. Generally, we may consummate a merger or consolidation if there is no event of default and the provisions of the notes are assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation. We are also generally limited in making acquisitions in excess of 10% of our total assets. An event of default, if not cured, would require us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the notes as well as any and all interest and other payments due. An event of default would also entitle Sun Life to exercise certain rights with respect to the collateral that secures the indebtedness incurred under the notes.\nThe Fixed Rate Note requires an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis. The interest coverage ratio is measured with respect to the Obligors on a consolidated basis and also with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. The note generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA to gross interest expense. The note defines EBITDA as net income plus the sum of interest expense, any provision for federal, state, and local taxes, depreciation, and amortization determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but excluding any extraordinary non-operating income or loss and any gain or loss from non-operating transactions. The notes also require that we do not permit indebtedness to exceed 60% of capitalization at any time. Like the interest coverage ratio, the ratio of debt to capitalization is measured on a consolidated basis for the Obligors, and again on a consolidated basis with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries.\n 42 \nRing Fencing Restrictions\nIn addition to the financial covenants under our credit facilities, the ring fencing provisions required by our regulatory commissions impose additional limitations on our liquidity. Specifically, usage of the Bank of America line of credit is regulated by ring fencing provisions from the MPSC, MPUC and NCUC. One of the ring fencing provisions issued by the MPSC requires that of the $30,000 line of credit available, $11,200 must be used or available to be used exclusively by Energy West Montana. The remaining $18,800 balance of the line of credit is available for use by Energy West and its other Montana, North Carolina and Maine subsidiaries. Energy West and Energy West Montana are required to provide monthly financial reports to the MPSC. We continue to monitor our compliance under these ring fencing provisions on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2015, we had available $9,168 to be drawn on the Bank of America line of credit after giving effect to the $11,200 allocation to Energy West Montana.\nOn November 24, 2014, the MPSC issued an order directing, in part, that Energy West require Gas Natural to repay an intercompany payable to Energy West by December 24, 2014. In addition, the MPSC order restricted Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries from paying dividends to Gas Natural until persuasive evidence could be presented that Energy West was on a sound financial footing and that effect had been given to the MPSC's ring-fencing conditions; the strongest indication being the absence of ongoing balances owed to Energy West by Gas Natural. On April 9, 2015, Energy West filed a request to reinstate Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to Gas Natural. On July 22, 2015, the MPSC issued an order allowing for the reinstatement of the dividends. They also approved a special dividend to be declared from the proceeds from the sale of Energy West's subsidiaries EWW and Pipeline assets.\nRing fencing provisions also subject us to certain restrictions on our capital structure. The MPSC requires Energy West to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than 52%. The total restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries related to debt covenants and the ring fencing is $76,233, or 79.8% of our net assets of $95,489 as of December 31, 2015. We believe we are in compliance with all ring fencing provisions.\nCorporate Structural Revisions and Pending Financing Agreements\nIn February 2016, we proposed to create a wholly-owned subsidiary under which each of our nine regulated entities will be held. This will streamline our corporate structure to facilitate greater focus on the four regulatory jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as to simplify our financing arrangements. With the new structure, which is subject to regulatory approval, the regulated entities will be segregated from non-regulated operations. We also announced that we reached an agreement with our lenders to refinance and consolidate our debt within our parent company. The long-term debt agreements include proposed issuance of up to $50,000 of senior notes, with maturities and interest rates to be determined upon closing, subject to prevailing market conditions at that time. Additionally, we will establish a $42,000 five-year revolving credit facility and finance a lease buyout of approximately $7,000 over a term of four years. Closing on the debt agreements is subject to negotiation of terms, requested regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Upon closing, proceeds from the new debt facilities will replace our five existing loan facilities and provide additional cash for operational purposes.\n 43 \nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations that require cash payment over future periods at December 31, 2015, were as follows:\n\n(1) The principle balance on our line of credit is not due until 2017, however due to its classification as a current liability it has been included as a contractual obligation due in 2016.\n(2) Build-to-suit lease is related to the third phase of our new ERP system, and will be evaluated for sale leaseback treatment upon its completion in 2016. The asset to be leased is not yet complete and as such actual amounts due may vary from the amounts presented.\n(3) Some of our natural gas purchase and capacity obligations are based on future market pricing. Cash payment estimates for these obligations are based on our price in effect as of December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOur recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies in

company operating local distribution companies in 4 states serving about 67,800 customers. It also does some natural gas marketing and production.\n\n2015 Performance \n- Revenue decreased due to lower natural gas prices passed through to customers, lower sales volumes, and other factors. Gross margin also decreased.\n- Operating expenses increased due to higher personnel costs, legal fees, depreciation/amortization, property taxes, and costs related to a new ERP system implementation.\n- Net income was $4.7 million compared to $3.8 million in 2014. Income from continuing operations declined but this was offset by a gain on sale of a subsidiary.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Cash from operations is the primary source of liquidity, supplemented by a revolving credit facility. Cash from operations declined in 2015 due to lower gas prices/volumes. \n- Capital expenditures were $9.6 million in 2015 compared to $21.6 million in 2014. Budget is $4.7 million for 2016.\n- The company is seeking to refinance debt and line of credit due in 2017. New proposed debt facilities would consolidate and refinance existing debt agreements.\n\nSo in summary, financial performance declined in 2015 and the company is facing some liquidity issues, but is working on refinancing debt facilities to maintain operations going forward."}
