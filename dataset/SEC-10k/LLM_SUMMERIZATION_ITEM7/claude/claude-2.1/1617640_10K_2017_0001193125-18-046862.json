Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nOverview of our Business\nZillow Group, Inc. operates the leading real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help consumers find vital information about homes and connect with local professionals. Zillow Group's brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling and financing. The Zillow Group portfolio of consumer brands includes real estate and rental marketplaces Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, RealEstate.com and OutEast.com. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions to help real estate, rental and mortgage professionals maximize business opportunities and connect with millions of consumers. We also own and operate a number of business brands for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals, including Mortech, dotloop, Bridge Interactive and New Home Feed.\nOur living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes-including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market-attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow's mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 75 million homes, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, through our industry-leading mobile applications and websites. Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, rental and mortgage industries. These professionals include real estate, rental and mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue.\nMarketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Premier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising under our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs, which offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers grow and manage their businesses and brands. We offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. Other real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, through which we offer advertising products in our rentals marketplace and a suite of tools for rental professionals, New Construction, which includes advertising services for home builders, as well as revenue from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions and services and technology solutions for real estate professionals. Mortgages revenue primarily includes advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals, as well as revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform.\nDisplay revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites.\nEffective February 17, 2015, Zillow Group acquired Trulia, Inc. (\u201cTrulia\u201d), and each of Zillow and Trulia became wholly owned subsidiaries of Zillow Group. The total purchase price of Trulia was approximately $2.0 billion. We have included Trulia in Zillow Group's results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Because the Trulia acquisition occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, the information presented in this report with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to Zillow on a standalone basis prior to February 17, 2015 and to Zillow Group after February 17, 2015, whereas the information presented in this section with respect to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 relates to Zillow Group. Results of operations, including marketplace revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015 include Market Leader revenue from February 17, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the date we divested the Market Leader business, whereas the information presented in this report with respect to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 does not include Market Leader revenue. For additional information regarding the transaction with Trulia, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOverview of Significant Milestones and Results\nThe following is a summary of certain of our significant milestones for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In January, we completed the acquisition of Hamptons Real Estate Online (\u201cHREO\u201d), a Hamptons-focused real estate portal that provides buyers and renters with a specialized search experience and access to the area's most comprehensive for-sale, for-rent and vacant land listings. For additional information about the acquisition of HREO, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In March, we launched Premier Agent on StreetEasy, New York City's leading real estate marketplace.

We plan to roll the feature out nationwide in the latter half of 2018. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>The year ended December 31, 2017 represents the first full year in which we implemented our new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth over the past three years. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, we focused on growing our marketplace revenue, which accounted for the majority of our revenue growth over that period. The increase in marketplace revenue resulted primarily from growth in our Premier Agent program. Our Premier Agent program represents the primary source of our revenue, and we believe it is more predictable than our other revenue sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated revenue of $1,076.8 million, $846.6 million and $644.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 27%, 31% and 98%, respectively. We believe achieving these levels of revenue growth was primarily the result of significant growth in traffic to our owned and operated mobile applications and websites-indicated by the average number of monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of 151.6 million, 140.1 million and 123.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 8%, 13% and 61%, respectively. This increase in unique users increases the number of impressions and clicks we can monetize in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In addition, we experienced a significant increase in our marketplace revenue, due primarily to growth in our Premier Agent program, which was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 6,314.4 million, 5,323.2 million and 3,991.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 19%, 33% and 61%, respectively. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $0.121, $0.114 and $0.112, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 6%, 1% and 24%, respectively. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which we believe increased the demand for our advertising platform from both existing and new advertisers. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising\nproduct, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 3,181 full-time employees compared to 2,776 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016.\nKey Metrics\nManagement has identified unique users and visits as relevant to investors' and others' assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnique Users\nMeasuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace revenue depends in part on our ability to enable real estate, rental and mortgage professionals to connect with our users, and our display revenue depends in part on the number of impressions delivered to our users. Growth in consumer traffic to our mobile applications and websites increases the number of impressions and clicks we can monetize in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In addition, our community of users improves the quality of our living database of homes with their contributions, which in turn attracts more users.\nWe count a unique user the first time an individual accesses one of our mobile applications using a mobile device during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses one of our websites using a web browser during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our mobile applications using different mobile devices within a given month, the first instance of access by each such mobile device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our mobile applications within a given month, the first access to each mobile application is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses our websites using different web browsers within a given month, the first access by each such web browser is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our websites in a single month, the first access to each website is counted as a separate unique user since unique users are tracked separately for each domain. Zillow, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments (as of March 2016) and RealEstate.com (as of June 2017) measure unique users with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures unique users with Adobe Analytics (formerly called Omniture analytical tools).\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 to 2017\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 to 2016\n% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Unique Users\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Visits\nThe number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers' level of engagement with our mobile applications and websites. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to be transaction-ready real estate market participants and therefore more sought-after by our agent and other real estate professional advertisers.\nWe define a visit as a group of interactions by users with the Zillow, Trulia (as of February 17, 2015), StreetEasy (as of March 2017) and RealEstate.com (as of June 2017) mobile applications and websites, as we monetize our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products on these mobile applications and websites. A single visit can contain multiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains, web browsers, desktop or mobile devices. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks or months.\nZillow, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com measure visits with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures visits with Adobe Analytics. Visits to Trulia end after thirty minutes of user inactivity. Visits to Zillow, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com end either: (i) after thirty minutes of user inactivity or at midnight; or (ii) through a campaign change. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source (for example, via a search engine or referring link on a third-party website), leaves the mobile application or website, and then returns via another campaign or source.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 to 2017\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 to 2016\n% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Visits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,314.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,323.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,991.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Basis of Presentation\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue.\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 also includes Market Leader revenue from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015.\nPremier Agent revenue is derived from our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms.\nWe offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms.\nFrom 2012 through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had primarily charged customers for our Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. With this pricing method, we recognized revenue related to our impression-based Premier Agent product based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list during the period multiplied by the contracted maximum cost per impression, or (ii) the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered, typically over a period of six months or twelve months and then month-to-month thereafter.\nWe continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulia's products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nOther real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis whereby we recognize revenue as leads are delivered to rental professionals or as qualified leases are confirmed. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis whereby revenue is recognized based on the contractual spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nMortgages revenue primarily includes marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services. Mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform, for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. For our Long Form and Custom Quote cost per lead mortgage marketing products, generally, participating qualified mortgage professionals make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. In Zillow Group's Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive consumer contact information. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from participating mortgage professionals. We only charge mortgage professionals a fee when users contact mortgage professionals through Long Form or Custom Quotes. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a user contacts a mortgage professional through Zillow Group's mortgages platform.\nMarket Leader revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of a comprehensive premium software-as-a-service based marketing product typically sold to real estate professionals as a bundle of products under a fixed fee subscription. Market Leader became part of Zillow Group through Zillow Group's February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and was divested as of September 30, 2015.\nDisplay Revenue. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Impressions are the number of times an advertisement is loaded on a web page and clicks are the number of times users click on an advertisement. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our mobile applications and websites or on our partner websites and mobile applications, and fees are generally billed monthly. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users interacting\nwith our mobile applications or websites. Growth in display revenue depends on continuing growth in traffic to our mobile applications and websites, continuing growth in traffic to our partner websites and mobile applications, migration of advertising spend online from traditional broadcast and print media, and effectiveness of display advertising versus other methods of online advertising.\nWe will begin reporting rentals revenue as a separate revenue category beginning with quarterly reporting for the three months ending March 31, 2018. In addition, display revenue will be included in our other revenue category and not reported separately. Going forward, other real estate revenue will be redefined as other revenue and will include revenue from new construction, dotloop, display, as well as from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses related to operating our mobile applications and websites, including associated headcount expenses, such as salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as credit card fees, ad serving costs paid to third parties, revenue-sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships, depreciation expense and costs associated with the operation of our data center and mobile applications and websites.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing activities, as well as headcount expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, and depreciation expense.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development and testing of our mobile applications and websites, and equipment and maintenance costs. Technology and development expenses also include amortization costs related to capitalized website and development activities, amortization of software, amortization of certain intangibles and other data agreement costs related to the purchase of data used to populate our mobile applications and websites, and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including developed technology and customer relationships, amongst others. Technology and development expenses also include depreciation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, recruiting, corporate information technology costs and other administrative support. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlement costs, legal, accounting and other third-party professional service fees, rent expense, depreciation expense and bad debt expense.\nImpairment and Restructuring Costs. Impairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 consists of the $174.0 million non-cash impairment related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of workforce reduction expenses in connection with a restructuring plan and related contract termination costs related to operating leases as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia.\nAcquisition-related Costs. Acquisition-related costs consist of investment banking, legal, accounting, tax, and regulatory filing fees associated with acquisitions.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses. The gain on divestiture of business recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 consists of the gain recognized in connection with our August 2016 sale of our Diverse\nSolutions business. The loss on divestiture of business recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of the loss recognized in connection with our September 2015 sale of the Market Leader business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the partial repurchase of Trulia's Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) in December 2016.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on the 2020 Notes we guaranteed in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and interest on the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) we issued in December 2016. Interest is payable on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.75% semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Interest is payable on the 2021 Notes at the rate of 2.00% semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and in Canada. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not have a material amount of current taxable income. We have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 because, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have accumulated federal tax losses of approximately $1,014.0 million as of December 31, 2017, which are available to reduce future taxable income. We have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $21.4 million (tax effected) as of December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and how AMT credits are utilized; and (5) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment, implementation guidance was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a company to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under the accounting rules is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it should record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. Further, the implementation guidance also provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting pursuant to the accounting rules.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $66.0 million of the income tax benefit relates to a $174.0 million non-cash impairment we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the non-cash impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining $23.6 million of the income tax benefit primarily relates to our initial analysis of the impact of the rate decrease\nincluded in the Tax Act for the impact of the reduction in our net deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act and we have recorded provisional adjustments where we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete, including as related to the deduction limitations on compensation.\nIn the absence of the changes in the Tax Act, our tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $66.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect an overall statutory tax rate (including federal, state and foreign taxes) of approximately 24%, but in the absence of the Tax Act we would have expected an overall tax rate of approximately 38%.\nIncome tax expense was not material for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with Zillow's August 20, 2015 acquisition of DotLoop, Inc. that can be used to realize certain deferred tax assets for which we had previously provided a full allowance.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables present our results of operations for

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as it is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Marketplace revenue increased by 29%, and display revenue increased by 2%. There were approximately 151.6 million average monthly unique users of our mobile applications and websites for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 140.1 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2016, representing year-over-year growth of 8%. This increase in unique users increased the number of impressions and clicks we monetized in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In connection with the hurricanes that occurred during the summer of 2017, we worked closely with our Premier Agents and other advertisers in affected areas to help manage their advertising budgets. We estimate that relief initiatives, which included billing credits and other forms of advertiser assistance, as well as lost sales, impacted Premier Agent revenue by approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also experienced a temporary decline in traffic to our mobile applications and websites from consumers in impacted areas, which may have impacted the number of unique users and visits for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMarketplace revenue grew to $1,007.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $778.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $229.1 million. Marketplace revenue represented 94% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 92% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily attributable to the $157.3 million, or 26%, increase in Premier Agent revenue. Premier Agent revenue was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits increased 19% to 6,314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 5,323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit increased by 6% to $0.121 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.114 for the year ended December 31, 2016. We calculate Premier Agent revenue per visit by dividing the revenue generated by our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs in the period by the number of visits in the period. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which may have increased the demand for our advertising platform. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising product, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. We continue to evaluate this pricing method, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in other real estate revenue, which increased by $62.4 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other real estate revenue was primarily a result of a 66% increase in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead, lease, or click that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per\nclick advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace. Other real estate revenue was also positively impacted by increased advertising sales to new home builders through our New Construction platform.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in mortgages revenue, which increased by $9.5 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in mortgages revenue was primarily a result of a 54% increase in our average revenue per loan information request for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average revenue per loan information request was primarily a result of our flagship mortgage advertising platform, Long Form, which yields higher revenue than our other mortgage advertising products, and increased consumer adoption of Long Form, which was driven by product enhancements that allow us to monetize our mortgages products more efficiently. There were approximately 22.7 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 30.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 26%. We believe the decrease in the number of loan information requests submitted by consumers is due to our strategic decision to improve loan information request quality by requiring consumers to provide more information before a loan information request is submitted. We believe our mortgage product feature change creates a better experience for consumers and more valuable loan information requests for our lender advertisers.\nDisplay revenue was $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.1 million. Display revenue represented 6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in display revenue was primarily a result of the increase in unique users, which resulted in a greater number of impressions and clicks we monetized. We continue to deemphasize display advertising in the user experience and instead focus on growth in marketplace revenue.\nWe will begin reporting rentals revenue as a separate revenue category beginning with quarterly reporting for the three months ending March 31, 2018. In addition, display revenue will be included in our other revenue category and not reported separately. Going forward, other real estate revenue will be redefined as other revenue and will include revenue from new construction, dotloop, display, as well as from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $15.9 million, or 23%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $7.9 million increase in revenue share costs, a $4.8 million increase in data center and connectivity costs, a $1.0 million increase in headcount- related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, a $0.8 million increase in credit card and ad serving fees and a $1.4 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future years as we continue to incur more expenses that are associated with growth in revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $448.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $65.8 million, or 17%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased marketing and advertising expenses of $34.2 million, primarily related to advertising spend to attract consumers across online and offline channels, which supports our growth initiatives.\nIn addition to the increases in marketing and advertising, headcount-related expenses increased $20.5 million, including share-based compensation expense, due primarily to significant growth in the size of our sales team. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was also attributable to a $6.0 million increase in tradeshows and conferences expense and related travel costs, a $2.5 million increase in consulting costs to support our advertising initiatives, a $1.1 million increase in software, hardware and connectivity costs, and a $1.5 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future years as we continue to expand our sales team and invest more resources in extending our audience through marketing and advertising initiatives.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, were $320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $255.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $64.4 million, or 25%. Approximately $44.3 million of the increase related to growth in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, as we continue to grow our engineering teams to support current and future product initiatives. In addition, there was a $10.0 million increase in other non-capitalizable data content expense, a $5.4 million increase in the amortization of purchased data content intangible assets, a $1.3 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $1.1 million increase in software and hardware costs, and a $2.3 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAmortization expense included in technology and development for capitalized website development costs and software was $44.4 million and $43.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amortization expense included in technology and development related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions was $40.0 million and $38.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other data content expense was $35.4 million and $25.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amortization expense included in technology and development for purchased data content intangible assets was $10.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time as we continue to build new mobile and website functionality.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $210.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $121.2 million, or 37%. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the settlement of a lawsuit with Move, Inc. and certain related entities (collectively, \u201cMove\u201d) in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims. In addition, there was a $31.1 million decrease in professional services fees, primarily as a result of our settlement of litigation with Move, as we incurred $28.8 million in legal costs related to our litigation with Move for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, driven primarily by growth in headcount in shared corporate services to support our engineering and other teams, a $7.5 million increase in building lease-related expenses including rent, utilities and insurance, a $6.0 million increase in estimated legal liabilities, a $4.7 million increase in bad debt expense, a $3.7 million increase in city and state taxes, a $2.9 million increase in software and hardware costs, a $2.0 million increase in the loss on disposal of assets, a $1.0 million increase in travel expenses, and a $1.2 million increase in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase over time in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our business.\nImpairment Costs\nImpairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 consist of the $174.0 million non-cash impairment related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February\n2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. There were no impairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs were $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of our January 2017 acquisition of HREO and our September 2017 acquisition of New Home Feed, including legal and accounting fees. Acquisition-related costs were $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, including legal, accounting and tax fees.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses\nThere was no loss (gain) on divestiture of business for the year ended December 31, 2017. The gain on divestiture of business of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThere was no loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss on debt extinguishment was $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the partial repurchase of the 2020 Notes in December 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense primarily related to the 2021 Notes that were issued on December 12, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense primarily related to the 2020 Notes that we guaranteed in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia. For additional information regarding the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $66.0 million of the income tax benefit relates to a $174.0 million non-cash impairment we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the non-cash impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining $23.6 million of the income tax benefit primarily relates to our initial analysis of the impact of the rate decrease included in the Tax Act for the impact of the reduction in our net deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset. Income tax expense was not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 to 2016\n% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketplace revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premier Agent\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market Leader\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Marketplace revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>778,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Display revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>846,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>644,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of Total Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketplace revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premier Agent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market Leader\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Marketplace revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Display revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Overall revenue increased by $201.9 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Marketplace revenue increased by 40%, and display revenue decreased by 23%. There were approximately 140.1 million average monthly unique users of our mobile applications and websites for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 123.7 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2015, representing year-over-year growth of 13%. This increase in unique users increased the number of impressions and clicks we monetized in our marketplace and display revenue categories.\nMarketplace revenue grew to $778.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $555.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $222.2 million. Marketplace revenue represented 92% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 86% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily attributable to the $157.4 million, or 35%, increase in Premier Agent revenue. Premier Agent revenue was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits increased 33% to 5,323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3,991.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit increased by 1% to $0.114 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.112 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Beginning on February 17, 2015, the reported visits reflect the effect of Zillow Group's February 17, 2015 acquisition of Trulia.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in other real estate revenue, which increased by $67.5 million, or 192%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The increase in other real estate revenue was primarily a result of a 124% increase in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead or lease that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead and cost per lease advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in mortgages revenue, which increased by $26.9 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in mortgages revenue was primarily a result of a 153% increase in our average revenue per loan information request for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in average revenue per loan information request was primarily a result of our flagship mortgage advertising platform, Long Form, which yields higher revenue than our other mortgage advertising products, and increased consumer adoption of Long Form, which was driven by product enhancements that allow us to monetize our mortgages products more efficiently. There were approximately 30.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 46.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately 34%. We believe the decrease in the number of loan information requests submitted by consumers is due to our strategic decision to improve loan information request quality by requiring consumers to provide more information before a loan information request is submitted. We believe our mortgage product feature change creates a better experience for consumers and more valuable loan information requests for our lender advertisers. During the first half of 2015 we changed the pricing model for our mortgage advertising products from cost per click to cost per lead, which also may have contributed to growth in mortgages revenue.\nDisplay revenue was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $20.2 million. Display revenue represented 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in display revenue is primarily a result of our strategy to deemphasize display advertising in the user experience and instead focus on growth in marketplace revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $9.1 million, or 15%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in data center and connectivity costs, increased headcount-related expenses of $3.8 million, including share-based compensation expense, driven by growth in headcount, and a $3.6 million increase in credit card and ad serving fees, which were partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in printing costs and costs to generate leads for customers related to the Market Leader business that we divested on September 30, 2015 and a $0.7 million decrease in multiple listing services fees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $308.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $74.3 million, or 24%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased headcount-related expenses of $45.9 million, including share-based compensation expense, due primarily to significant growth in the size of our sales team. In addition to the increase in headcount-related expenses, marketing and advertising expenses increased by $30.1 million, primarily related to advertising spend to acquire shoppers across online and offline channels, which supports our growth initiatives. These costs were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, were $255.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $71.1 million, or 39%. Approximately $36.9 million of the increase related to growth in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, as we continue to grow our engineering headcount to support current and future product initiatives. Approximately $19.9 million of the increase related to an increase in amortization of website development costs and software. The increase in technology and development expenses was also attributable to a $9.4 million increase in other non-capitalizable data content expense, a $5.3 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, and a $2.5 million increase in loss on disposal of property and equipment, which were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in amortization of purchased content and a $1.6 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAmortization expense included in technology and development for capitalized website development costs and software was $43.8 million and $23.9 million, respectively, the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense included in technology and development related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions was $38.7 million and $33.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Other data content expense was $25.5 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense included in technology and development for purchased data content intangible assets was $4.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $185.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $147.0 million, or 79%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the settlement of a lawsuit with Move, Inc. and certain other parties in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was also a result of a $11.6 million increase in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, including the impact of growth in headcount as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, a $4.3 million increase in building lease-related expenses including rent, utilities and insurance, and a $1.1 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs were $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, including legal, accounting and tax fees. Acquisition-related costs were $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, including investment banking, legal, accounting, tax, and regulatory filing fees.\nRestructuring Costs\nThere were no restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $35.6 million. On February 17, 2015, in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, Zillow Group undertook a restructuring plan that resulted in a total workforce reduction of nearly 350 employees, primarily to eliminate overlapping positions in the sales and marketing functions related to Trulia's workforce at its Bellevue, Denver, New York and San Francisco locations. The restructuring plan was a result of the integration of Trulia's business and operations with and into Zillow Group's business. Employees directly affected by the restructuring plan were provided with severance payments, stock vesting acceleration and outplacement assistance. As of December 31, 2015, the restructuring plan was complete.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses\nThe gain on divestiture of business was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business. The loss on divestiture of business was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and relates to the September 2015 sale of our Market Leader business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment was $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the partial repurchase of the 2020 Notes in December 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interest expense for each year primarily relates to the 2020 Notes that we guaranteed in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, which accrue interest at 2.75% annually.\nOn December 12, 2016, Zillow Group issued the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2017. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, our interest expense increased in future periods related to the contractual coupon interest and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs that will be recognized in interest expense.\nFor additional information regarding the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have a material amount of current taxable income. Therefore, no material tax liability or expense has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with Zillow's August 20, 2015 acquisition of DotLoop, Inc. that can be used to realize certain deferred tax assets for which we had previously provided a full allowance.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the periods presented below.

revenue increased sequentially in all quarters presented. In general, the strong increase in consumer adoption of our mobile applications and websites in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nwas reflected in the significant growth in unique users, which resulted in increased impression inventory, leads, and graphical display impressions we could monetize through our advertising products.\nPremier Agent revenue also increased sequentially in all quarters presented. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising product, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which may have increased the demand for our advertising platform. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nThe year-over-year quarterly increases in revenue were also attributable to year-over-year growth in other real estate revenue, which was primarily a result increases in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead, lease, or click that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace. Other real estate revenue was also positively impacted by increased advertising sales to new home builders through our New Construction platform.\nThe composition of revenue continues to shift from display revenue to marketplace revenue, as we continue to dedicate more of our advertising placements on search, map and home detail pages to our information marketplace products, which provide consumers with services that are directly relevant to home-related searches.\nPortions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. We believe our rapid growth may be masking the underlying seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth rate slows, we expect seasonal variances may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, costs and expenses peaked in the three months ended June 30th, primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses which were, in turn, primarily attributable to increased investment in marketing and advertising initiatives to attract consumers across online and offline channels during peak seasons for home sales activity. In addition, the average number of unique users and visits have historically peaked during the three months ended June 30th or September 30th, also consistent with peak residential real estate activity in the spring and summer months. Because the number of unique users and visits may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory which we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users and visits may result in seasonality of revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for each of the periods presented below.

Because the number of unique users may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory which we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users may result in seasonality of revenue.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average for the Three Months Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unique Users\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Visits\nThe following tables set forth our visits for each of the periods presented below.

Consistent with the trend in our unique users discussed\nabove, the number of visits has historically peaked during the three months ended June 30 or September 30, consistent with seasonal variances of home sales which generally peak in the spring and summer months.

Cash and cash equivalents balances consist of operating cash on deposit with financial institutions, money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less. Investments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consist of fixed income securities, which include U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, municipal securities, certificates of deposit and foreign government securities. Amounts on deposit with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. We believe that cash from operations and cash, cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOn February 17, 2015, we acquired Trulia in a stock-for-stock transaction. The total purchase price of Trulia was approximately $2.0 billion. We have included Trulia's results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia had a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, as a result of the acquisition, Zillow Group entered into a supplemental indenture in respect of the 2020 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $230.0 million, which supplemental indenture provides, among other things, that, at the effective time of the Trulia acquisition, (i) each outstanding 2020 Note is no longer convertible into shares of Trulia common stock and is convertible solely into shares of Zillow Group Class A common stock, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes, and (ii) Zillow Group guaranteed all of the obligations of Trulia under the 2020 Notes and related indenture. The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes is due on December 15, 2020 if not earlier converted or redeemed. Interest is payable on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.75% semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. In December 2016, the Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes discussed below to repurchase $219.9 million aggregate principal of the 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions.\nHolders of the 2020 Notes may convert all or any portion of their notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. In connection with the supplemental indenture in respect of the 2020 Notes, the conversion ratio immediately prior to the effective time of the Trulia Merger of 27.8303 shares of Trulia common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes was adjusted to 12.3567 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes based on the exchange ratio of 0.444 per the Merger Agreement. This was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.93 per share of our Class A common stock. In connection with the August 2015 distribution of shares of our Class C capital stock as a dividend to our Class A and Class B common shareholders, the conversion ratio has been further adjusted to 41.4550 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $24.12 per\nshare of our Class A common stock. The conversion ratio will be adjusted for certain dilutive events and will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the notes). The conversion option of the 2020 Notes has no cash settlement provisions. The conversion option does not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as it is indexed to our own stock.\nThe 2020 Notes are redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part on or after December 20, 2018, if the last reported sale price per share of our Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.\nFor additional information regarding the 2020 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2016, Zillow Group issued $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, which amount includes the exercise in full of the $60.0 million over-allotment option, to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as the initial purchaser of the 2021 Notes in a private offering to the initial purchaser in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) for resale to qualified institutional buyers as defined in, and pursuant to, Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2017. The 2021 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class C capital stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's election. The 2021 Notes will mature on December 1, 2021, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $12.2 million related to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, including approximately $11.5 million in fees to the initial purchaser, which amount was paid out of the gross proceeds from the note offering.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were approximately $447.8 million, after deducting fees and expenses. The Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. In addition, the Company used approximately $36.6 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes to pay the cost of Capped Call Confirmations as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. The Company used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2021, the 2021 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the 2021 Notes only under certain conditions, none of which conditions have been satisfied as of December 31, 2017. On or after September 1, 2021, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at their option at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions of the 2021 Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class C capital stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class C capital stock, at its election. The conversion rate will initially be 19.0985 shares of Class C capital stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.36 per share of Class C capital stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2021 Notes, at its option, on or after December 6, 2019, under certain circumstances at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes).\nWe may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to December 6, 2019. We may redeem the 2021 Notes for cash, at our option, in whole or in part on or after December 6, 2019, if the last reported sale price per share of our Class C capital stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.\nFor additional information regarding the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, we acquired HREO for an immaterial amount. A substantial majority of the purchase price for HREO has been allocated to goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn June 2017, we purchased an equity interest in a privately held corporation for approximately $10.0 million. For additional information regarding the equity interest, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2017, we acquired New Home Feed for an immaterial amount. A substantial majority of the purchase price for New Home Feed has been allocated to goodwill and an intangible asset.\nThe following table presents selected cash flow data for the periods presented:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(247,394 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,719 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities\nOur operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from real estate professionals, mortgage professionals, rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments for marketing and advertising activities and employee benefits and compensation. Additionally, uses of cash from operating activities include costs associated with operating our mobile applications and websites and other general corporate expenditures.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $258.2 million. This was primarily driven by a net loss of $94.4 million, adjusted by a non-cash impairment charge of $174.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $110.2 million, share-based compensation expense of $113.6 million, an $89.6 million non-cash change in our net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance as a result of the non-cash impairment charge and the rate decrease included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the 2021 Notes of $18.0 million, an increase in bad debt expense of $7.3 million, a change in deferred rent of $7.1 million and a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $5.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $5.9 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily due to a $21.2 million increase in accounts receivable driven by an increase in revenue, a $19.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to growth in our business, partially offset by a $10.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets driven primarily by the timing of payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.6 million. This was driven by a net loss of $220.4 million, including the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit for $130.0 million in June 2016, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $106.9 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $100.6 million, a loss on debt extinguishment of $22.8 million, a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $3.7 million, an increase in bad debt expense of $2.7 million, an increase in the balance of deferred rent of $1.7 million, amortization of bond premium of $1.5 million, a $1.4 million gain on the divestiture of a business, a $1.4 million non-cash change in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments, and amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the 2021 Notes of $0.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash\nprovided by operating activities by $8.9 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a $13.3 million decrease in accounts receivable driven by the timing of payments received, a $13.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by the timing of payments made, and a $12.5 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits due primarily to an increase in sales commissions driven by increased sales as well as the timing of payroll.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.7 million. This was driven by a net loss of $148.9 million, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $105.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $75.4 million, non-cash restructuring costs of $19.0 million, a $3.9 million non-cash loss on divestiture of businesses, net, bad debt expense of $3.2 million, a $2.9 million non-cash change in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with our acquisition of DotLoop, Inc., an increase in the balance of deferred rent of $2.6 million, amortization of bond premium of $2.5 million, and a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $1.4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities by $38.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities include the purchase and sale or maturity of investments, the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets, the purchase of cost method investments, net cash paid in connection with acquisitions and proceeds from divestiture of businesses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $247.4 million. This was primarily the result of $147.8 million of net purchases of investments, $78.6 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets, $11.5 million paid in connection with acquisitions, and approximately $10.0 million related to the purchase of a cost method investment, partially offset by $0.6 million in proceeds from our August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $65.7 million. This was primarily the result of $71.7 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets, $16.3 million paid in connection with our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, $10.0 million related to the purchase of a cost method investment, partially offset by $29.1 million of net maturities and sales of investments and $3.2 million in proceeds from the divestiture of a business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $64.4 million. This was primarily the result of $173.4 million of net cash acquired in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, $36.0 million of net proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, and $23.4 million in proceeds from the divestiture of businesses, partially offset by $104.2 million paid in connection with our acquisition of DotLoop, Inc., $68.1 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets and a $3.9 million decrease in restricted cash.\nThe increases in capital expenditures and intangible assets during all three periods reflect our continued investments in support of business growth. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our business to provide for the continued innovation in our products and services in 2018 and thereafter.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our financing activities primarily related to the exercise of employee option awards. The proceeds from the exercise of option awards for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $98.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes, net of issuance costs, were $447.8 million. The Company also paid approximately $36.6 million in premiums for certain Capped Call Confirmations in December 2016. The Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds\nfrom the issuance of the 2021 Notes to repurchase $219.9 million aggregate principal of the 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. The proceeds from the exercise of option awards for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $31.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the proceeds from the exercise of option awards were $24.4 million. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 million of equity awards were withheld for tax liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We do not believe that the surety bonds will have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support. For additional information regarding the surety bonds, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements under the subsection titled \u201cSurety Bonds\u201d.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, unaudited) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2021 Notes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>460,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>460,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 2021 Notes (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 Notes (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 2020 Notes (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>886,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>558,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>The aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes is due on December 1, 2021 if not earlier converted or redeemed. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>The stated interest rate on the 2021 Notes is 2.00%. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>(3) </td> <td>The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes is due on December 15, 2020 if not earlier converted or redeemed. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>(4) </td> <td>The stated interest rate on the 2020 Notes is 2.75%. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>(5) </td> <td>Our operating lease obligations consist of various operating leases for office space under noncancelable operating lease agreements.

If we were to fail to perform or comply with these obligations, any draws upon surety bonds issued on our behalf would then trigger our payment obligation to the surety bond issuer. We have outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and software development costs, recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives, share-based compensation, income taxes, business combinations, and the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue. Incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a customer contract in a transaction that results in the deferral of revenue are expensed as incurred.\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. In addition, Market Leader revenue is included in our results of operations in Marketplace revenue from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015.\nPremier Agent revenue is derived from our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms.\nWe offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control\ntheir budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms.\nFrom 2012 through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had primarily charged customers for our Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. With this pricing method, we recognized revenue related to our impression-based Premier Agent product based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list during the period multiplied by the contracted maximum cost per impression, or (ii) the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered, typically over a period of six months or twelve months and then month-to-month thereafter.\nWe continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulia's products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nOther real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis whereby we recognize revenue as leads are delivered to rental professionals or as qualified leases are confirmed. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis whereby revenue is recognized based on the contractual spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nMortgages revenue primarily includes marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services. Mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform, for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. For our Long Form and Custom Quote cost per lead mortgage marketing products, generally, participating qualified mortgage professionals make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. In Zillow Group's Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive consumer contact information. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from participating mortgage professionals. We only charge mortgage professionals a fee when users contact mortgage professionals through Long Form or Custom Quotes. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a user contacts a mortgage professional through Zillow Group's mortgages platform.\nMarket Leader revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of a comprehensive premium software-as-a-service based marketing product typically sold to real estate professionals as a bundle of products under a fixed fee subscription. Market Leader became part of Zillow Group through Zillow Group's February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and was divested as of September 30, 2015.\nDisplay Revenue. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Impressions are the number of times an advertisement is loaded on a web page and clicks are the number of times users click on an advertisement. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our mobile applications and websites or on our partner websites and mobile applications, and fees are generally billed monthly. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users interacting with our mobile applications or websites.\nUpon our January 1, 2018 adoption of the new guidance issued by the FASB on revenue from contracts with customers, we expect that the number of estimates and assumptions we make will increase related to revenue recognition and the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including, but not limited to, estimates and assumptions related to variable consideration, practical expedients applied, and the period over which commission costs will be recognized.\nWebsite and Software Development Costs\nThe costs incurred in the preliminary stages of website and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by management to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the websites (or software) that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.\nCapitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases, currently estimated at one to two years. Estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed frequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or enhancements to the existing functionality.\nWe exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our mobile applications and websites, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets, or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of website and software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such review at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the other groups of assets and liabilities. If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of impairment to be recognized is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group.\nUnforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could adversely affect the fair value of our assets and could result in an impairment charge. Fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices, prices for comparable assets, or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows, multiples of earnings or revenues, and we may make various assumptions and estimates when performing our impairment assessments, particularly as it relates to cash flow projections. Cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective, and include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and forecasted operating performance, revenue trends and operating margins. These estimates could also be adversely impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments, or other market conditions affecting our industry.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value for option awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the option awards' vesting period. For restricted stock units and restricted units, we use the market value of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the date of grant to determine the fair value of the award, and we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards' vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model changes significantly, share-based compensation expense for future option awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. In valuing our option awards, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives. In addition, through December 31, 2016, we made assumptions about estimated forfeiture rates. Beginning on January 1, 2017, we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nRisk-free interest rate. Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option award's grant date.\nExpected dividend yields. Expected dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero to date.\nVolatility. The expected volatility for our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock is estimated using our historical volatility.\nExpected term. The weighted-average expected life of the option awards is estimated based on our historical exercise data.\nForfeiture rate. Prior to January 1, 2017, forfeiture rates were estimated using historical actual forfeiture trends as well as our judgment of future forfeitures. These rates were evaluated at least quarterly and any change in share-based compensation expense was recognized in the period of the change. We considered many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected terms utilized for our share-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from management's current estimates. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility and expected terms, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. In future periods, we expect our share-based compensation expense to increase as a result of our existing, unrecognized share-based compensation that will be recognized as the awards vest, and as we grant additional share-based awards to attract and retain employees.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.\nOur assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments, and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nSince inception, we have typically incurred annual operating losses, and accordingly, we have generally not recorded a material current provision for income taxes, though we have historically in certain instances recorded income tax benefits in connection with acquisitions. We generally do not expect any significant changes in the amount of our income tax provision until we are not routinely incurring operating losses.\nWe establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, new tax legislation or the change of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and how AMT credits are utilized; and (5) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment, implementation guidance was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a company to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under the accounting rules is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it should record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. Further, the implementation guidance also provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting pursuant to the accounting rules.\nIn the absence of the changes in the Tax Act, our tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $66.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect an overall statutory tax rate (including federal, state and foreign taxes) of approximately 24%, but in the absence of the Tax Act we would have expected an overall tax rate of approximately 38%. In 2018, we expect to record income tax benefits to the extent we generate additional operating loss carryforwards.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the\nacquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions for the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition, and is not amortized. We assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Typically, we choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and perform quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in our statements of operations.\nFor our most recent goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2017, we chose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis whereby we determined that our market capitalization is well in excess of the book value of our common stock, and therefore, we concluded that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible asset is not amortized, and we assess the asset for impairment on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. On an interim basis we consider if there are any events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, including, but not limited to, costs that could have a negative effect on future expected earnings and cash flows, changes in certain key performance metrics, and changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers. In our evaluation of our trade names and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset, we typically first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired. If so, we perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded in our statements of operations for the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $174.0 million related to our indefinite-lived Trulia trade names and trademarks intangible asset. In connection with our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of this asset during our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017, we identified factors that led us to conclude it was more likely than not that the $351.0 million carrying value of the asset exceeded its fair value. The most significant of such factors was a shortfall in projected revenue related to the Trulia brand compared to projections at the time the intangible asset was initially recorded in February 2015. Accordingly, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we performed a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the intangible asset and concluded that our best estimate of its fair value was $177.0 million. The valuation was prepared using an income approach based on the relief-from-royalty method and relied on inputs with unobservable market prices including the assumed revenue growth rates, royalty rate, discount rate and estimated tax rate. In connection with this impairment analysis, we evaluated our planned future use of the Trulia trade names and trademarks intangible asset and concluded that it remains appropriate to consider this asset to have an indefinite life.\nTo the extent there is a shortfall in actual estimated revenue attributable to the Trulia brand as compared to our estimated projections as of October 1, 2017, the date of our most recent annual impairment test, additional impairment could be recorded in future periods.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nFor information about our recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nOverview of our Business\nZillow Group, Inc. operates the leading real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help consumers find vital information about homes and connect with local professionals. Zillow Group's brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling and financing. The Zillow Group portfolio of consumer brands includes real estate and rental marketplaces Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, RealEstate.com and OutEast.com. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions to help real estate, rental and mortgage professionals maximize business opportunities and connect with millions of consumers. We also own and operate a number of business brands for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals, including Mortech, dotloop, Bridge Interactive and New Home Feed.\nOur living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes-including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market-attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow's mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 75 million homes, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, through our industry-leading mobile applications and websites. Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, rental and mortgage industries. These professionals include real estate, rental and mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue.\nMarketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Premier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising under our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs, which offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers grow and manage their businesses and brands. We offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. Other real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, through which we offer advertising products in our rentals marketplace and a suite of tools for rental professionals, New Construction, which includes advertising services for home builders, as well as revenue from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions and services and technology solutions for real estate professionals. Mortgages revenue primarily includes advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals, as well as revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform.\nDisplay revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites.\nEffective February 17, 2015, Zillow Group acquired Trulia, Inc. (\u201cTrulia\u201d), and each of Zillow and Trulia became wholly owned subsidiaries of Zillow Group. The total purchase price of Trulia was approximately $2.0 billion. We have included Trulia in Zillow Group's results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Because the Trulia acquisition occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, the information presented in this report with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to Zillow on a standalone basis prior to February 17, 2015 and to Zillow Group after February 17, 2015, whereas the information presented in this section with respect to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 relates to Zillow Group. Results of operations, including marketplace revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015 include Market Leader revenue from February 17, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the date we divested the Market Leader business, whereas the information presented in this report with respect to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 does not include Market Leader revenue. For additional information regarding the transaction with Trulia, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOverview of Significant Milestones and Results\nThe following is a summary of certain of our significant milestones for the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 In January, we completed the acquisition of Hamptons Real Estate Online (\u201cHREO\u201d), a Hamptons-focused real estate portal that provides buyers and renters with a specialized search experience and access to the area's most comprehensive for-sale, for-rent and vacant land listings. For additional information about the acquisition of HREO, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 In March, we launched Premier Agent on StreetEasy, New York City's leading real estate marketplace. By integrating StreetEasy with Zillow and Trulia, real estate professionals can now reach the largest audience of New York City home shoppers through one platform. In June, we implemented paid inclusion advertising for rental listings featured on StreetEasy, which significantly improved the quality of rental listings. \n \u2022 In March, we launched a new Dotloop application program interface platform for developers. The update makes it easier for developers to more seamlessly create new integrations for external real estate technology and transaction services with Dotloop's platform. \n \u2022 In April, we launched a new national advertising campaign, \u201cFinding Home\u201d, with several national TV spots featuring different stories that illustrate the diversity of home buyers today and their unique and varied challenges. \n \u2022 In May, we launched RealEstate.com, a new consumer real estate brand tailored to first-time home buyers. On RealEstate.com, buyers can search for homes in a completely new way-by the monthly payment and down payment they can afford. \n \u2022 In May, we announced our testing of the Zillow Instant Offers marketplace, a way for homeowners to sell their homes quickly by providing them with offers from investors and a comparative market analysis from a local real estate agent, as an estimate for what the home might fetch on the open market. In addition to investors being required to use an agent, should a homeowner select an investor's offer, Zillow will also offer to connect them with a local agent to represent them throughout the transaction. \n \u2022 In May, we launched Zillow Prize, a machine learning competition to improve Zestimate accuracy, with a grand prize of up to $1 million to the person or team who submits the most improved Zestimate algorithm model. \n \u2022 In June, we launched Builder Inform, a cloud-based data dashboard that provides robust anonymized consumer insight data from Zillow Group to residential builders to help them make decisions about future projects. Builder Inform allows builders to view and compare currently listed homes by type and location to help them understand what they should build based on consumer demand in a given zip code. \n \u2022 In June, we purchased an equity interest in a privately held corporation for approximately $10.0 million. For additional information regarding the equity interest, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 In September, we completed the acquisition of New Home Feed, a streamlined listing management technology that allows builders to input, manage and syndicate their listings across the web. For additional information about the acquisition of New Home Feed, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 In October, we announced new products to help Premier Agents deepen their connections with clients and build their own personal brands through new technologies in the Premier Agent App, including My Agent. Zillow Group's evolving tech features will streamline agent-client communication and allow agents to appear as a client's only buyer's agent for listings they view on Zillow or Trulia. \n \u2022 In October, we announced the beta launch of Rental Inform, a cloud-based data dashboard of Zillow Group's exclusive real-time, robust rental market and aggregated, anonymized consumer insight data, which helps property management companies make more informed decisions about operations, marketing and investments. \n \u2022 In October, we announced plans to bring 3D Homes imaging technology to for-sale and for-rent listings. With the launch of the Zillow Group Home Capture App, homeowners and real estate professionals can capture 3D tours of their homes from their iPhones\u00ae and post to listings on Zillow and Trulia at no cost, providing home searchers with a new and more immersive way to envision themselves in a home. We plan to roll the feature out nationwide in the latter half of 2018. \n \u2022 The year ended December 31, 2017 represents the first full year in which we implemented our new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. \nWe have experienced significant revenue growth over the past three years. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, we focused on growing our marketplace revenue, which accounted for the majority of our revenue growth over that period. The increase in marketplace revenue resulted primarily from growth in our Premier Agent program. Our Premier Agent program represents the primary source of our revenue, and we believe it is more predictable than our other revenue sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated revenue of $1,076.8 million, $846.6 million and $644.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 27%, 31% and 98%, respectively. We believe achieving these levels of revenue growth was primarily the result of significant growth in traffic to our owned and operated mobile applications and websites-indicated by the average number of monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of 151.6 million, 140.1 million and 123.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 8%, 13% and 61%, respectively. This increase in unique users increases the number of impressions and clicks we can monetize in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In addition, we experienced a significant increase in our marketplace revenue, due primarily to growth in our Premier Agent program, which was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 6,314.4 million, 5,323.2 million and 3,991.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 19%, 33% and 61%, respectively. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $0.121, $0.114 and $0.112, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 6%, 1% and 24%, respectively. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which we believe increased the demand for our advertising platform from both existing and new advertisers. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising\nproduct, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 3,181 full-time employees compared to 2,776 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016.\nKey Metrics\nManagement has identified unique users and visits as relevant to investors' and others' assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnique Users\nMeasuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace revenue depends in part on our ability to enable real estate, rental and mortgage professionals to connect with our users, and our display revenue depends in part on the number of impressions delivered to our users. Growth in consumer traffic to our mobile applications and websites increases the number of impressions and clicks we can monetize in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In addition, our community of users improves the quality of our living database of homes with their contributions, which in turn attracts more users.\nWe count a unique user the first time an individual accesses one of our mobile applications using a mobile device during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses one of our websites using a web browser during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our mobile applications using different mobile devices within a given month, the first instance of access by each such mobile device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our mobile applications within a given month, the first access to each mobile application is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses our websites using different web browsers within a given month, the first access by each such web browser is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our websites in a single month, the first access to each website is counted as a separate unique user since unique users are tracked separately for each domain. Zillow, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments (as of March 2016) and RealEstate.com (as of June 2017) measure unique users with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures unique users with Adobe Analytics (formerly called Omniture analytical tools).\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 to 2017\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 to 2016\n% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Unique Users\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Visits\nThe number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers' level of engagement with our mobile applications and websites. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to be transaction-ready real estate market participants and therefore more sought-after by our agent and other real estate professional advertisers.\nWe define a visit as a group of interactions by users with the Zillow, Trulia (as of February 17, 2015), StreetEasy (as of March 2017) and RealEstate.com (as of June 2017) mobile applications and websites, as we monetize our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products on these mobile applications and websites. A single visit can contain multiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains, web browsers, desktop or mobile devices. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks or months.\nZillow, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com measure visits with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures visits with Adobe Analytics. Visits to Trulia end after thirty minutes of user inactivity. Visits to Zillow, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com end either: (i) after thirty minutes of user inactivity or at midnight; or (ii) through a campaign change. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source (for example, via a search engine or referring link on a third-party website), leaves the mobile application or website, and then returns via another campaign or source.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 to 2017\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 to 2016\n% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Visits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,314.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,323.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,991.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Basis of Presentation\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue.\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 also includes Market Leader revenue from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015.\nPremier Agent revenue is derived from our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms.\nWe offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms.\nFrom 2012 through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had primarily charged customers for our Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. With this pricing method, we recognized revenue related to our impression-based Premier Agent product based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list during the period multiplied by the contracted maximum cost per impression, or (ii) the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered, typically over a period of six months or twelve months and then month-to-month thereafter.\nWe continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulia's products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nOther real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis whereby we recognize revenue as leads are delivered to rental professionals or as qualified leases are confirmed. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis whereby revenue is recognized based on the contractual spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nMortgages revenue primarily includes marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services. Mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform, for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. For our Long Form and Custom Quote cost per lead mortgage marketing products, generally, participating qualified mortgage professionals make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. In Zillow Group's Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive consumer contact information. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from participating mortgage professionals. We only charge mortgage professionals a fee when users contact mortgage professionals through Long Form or Custom Quotes. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a user contacts a mortgage professional through Zillow Group's mortgages platform.\nMarket Leader revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of a comprehensive premium software-as-a-service based marketing product typically sold to real estate professionals as a bundle of products under a fixed fee subscription. Market Leader became part of Zillow Group through Zillow Group's February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and was divested as of September 30, 2015.\nDisplay Revenue. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Impressions are the number of times an advertisement is loaded on a web page and clicks are the number of times users click on an advertisement. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our mobile applications and websites or on our partner websites and mobile applications, and fees are generally billed monthly. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users interacting\nwith our mobile applications or websites. Growth in display revenue depends on continuing growth in traffic to our mobile applications and websites, continuing growth in traffic to our partner websites and mobile applications, migration of advertising spend online from traditional broadcast and print media, and effectiveness of display advertising versus other methods of online advertising.\nWe will begin reporting rentals revenue as a separate revenue category beginning with quarterly reporting for the three months ending March 31, 2018. In addition, display revenue will be included in our other revenue category and not reported separately. Going forward, other real estate revenue will be redefined as other revenue and will include revenue from new construction, dotloop, display, as well as from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses related to operating our mobile applications and websites, including associated headcount expenses, such as salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as credit card fees, ad serving costs paid to third parties, revenue-sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships, depreciation expense and costs associated with the operation of our data center and mobile applications and websites.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing activities, as well as headcount expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, and depreciation expense.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development and testing of our mobile applications and websites, and equipment and maintenance costs. Technology and development expenses also include amortization costs related to capitalized website and development activities, amortization of software, amortization of certain intangibles and other data agreement costs related to the purchase of data used to populate our mobile applications and websites, and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including developed technology and customer relationships, amongst others. Technology and development expenses also include depreciation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, recruiting, corporate information technology costs and other administrative support. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlement costs, legal, accounting and other third-party professional service fees, rent expense, depreciation expense and bad debt expense.\nImpairment and Restructuring Costs. Impairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 consists of the $174.0 million non-cash impairment related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of workforce reduction expenses in connection with a restructuring plan and related contract termination costs related to operating leases as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia.\nAcquisition-related Costs. Acquisition-related costs consist of investment banking, legal, accounting, tax, and regulatory filing fees associated with acquisitions.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses. The gain on divestiture of business recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 consists of the gain recognized in connection with our August 2016 sale of our Diverse\nSolutions business. The loss on divestiture of business recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of the loss recognized in connection with our September 2015 sale of the Market Leader business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the partial repurchase of Trulia's Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) in December 2016.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on the 2020 Notes we guaranteed in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and interest on the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) we issued in December 2016. Interest is payable on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.75% semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Interest is payable on the 2021 Notes at the rate of 2.00% semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and in Canada. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not have a material amount of current taxable income. We have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 because, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have accumulated federal tax losses of approximately $1,014.0 million as of December 31, 2017, which are available to reduce future taxable income. We have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $21.4 million (tax effected) as of December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and how AMT credits are utilized; and (5) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment, implementation guidance was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a company to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under the accounting rules is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it should record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. Further, the implementation guidance also provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting pursuant to the accounting rules.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $66.0 million of the income tax benefit relates to a $174.0 million non-cash impairment we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the non-cash impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining $23.6 million of the income tax benefit primarily relates to our initial analysis of the impact of the rate decrease\nincluded in the Tax Act for the impact of the reduction in our net deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act and we have recorded provisional adjustments where we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete, including as related to the deduction limitations on compensation.\nIn the absence of the changes in the Tax Act, our tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $66.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect an overall statutory tax rate (including federal, state and foreign taxes) of approximately 24%, but in the absence of the Tax Act we would have expected an overall tax rate of approximately 38%.\nIncome tax expense was not material for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with Zillow's August 20, 2015 acquisition of DotLoop, Inc. that can be used to realize certain deferred tax assets for which we had previously provided a full allowance.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables present our results of operations for

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as it is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation; \n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss (gain) on divestiture of businesses;

Marketplace revenue increased by 29%, and display revenue increased by 2%. There were approximately 151.6 million average monthly unique users of our mobile applications and websites for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 140.1 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2016, representing year-over-year growth of 8%. This increase in unique users increased the number of impressions and clicks we monetized in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In connection with the hurricanes that occurred during the summer of 2017, we worked closely with our Premier Agents and other advertisers in affected areas to help manage their advertising budgets. We estimate that relief initiatives, which included billing credits and other forms of advertiser assistance, as well as lost sales, impacted Premier Agent revenue by approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also experienced a temporary decline in traffic to our mobile applications and websites from consumers in impacted areas, which may have impacted the number of unique users and visits for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMarketplace revenue grew to $1,007.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $778.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $229.1 million. Marketplace revenue represented 94% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 92% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily attributable to the $157.3 million, or 26%, increase in Premier Agent revenue. Premier Agent revenue was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits increased 19% to 6,314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 5,323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit increased by 6% to $0.121 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.114 for the year ended December 31, 2016. We calculate Premier Agent revenue per visit by dividing the revenue generated by our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs in the period by the number of visits in the period. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which may have increased the demand for our advertising platform. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising product, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. We continue to evaluate this pricing method, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in other real estate revenue, which increased by $62.4 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other real estate revenue was primarily a result of a 66% increase in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead, lease, or click that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per\nclick advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace. Other real estate revenue was also positively impacted by increased advertising sales to new home builders through our New Construction platform.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in mortgages revenue, which increased by $9.5 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in mortgages revenue was primarily a result of a 54% increase in our average revenue per loan information request for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average revenue per loan information request was primarily a result of our flagship mortgage advertising platform, Long Form, which yields higher revenue than our other mortgage advertising products, and increased consumer adoption of Long Form, which was driven by product enhancements that allow us to monetize our mortgages products more efficiently. There were approximately 22.7 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 30.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 26%. We believe the decrease in the number of loan information requests submitted by consumers is due to our strategic decision to improve loan information request quality by requiring consumers to provide more information before a loan information request is submitted. We believe our mortgage product feature change creates a better experience for consumers and more valuable loan information requests for our lender advertisers.\nDisplay revenue was $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.1 million. Display revenue represented 6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in display revenue was primarily a result of the increase in unique users, which resulted in a greater number of impressions and clicks we monetized. We continue to deemphasize display advertising in the user experience and instead focus on growth in marketplace revenue.\nWe will begin reporting rentals revenue as a separate revenue category beginning with quarterly reporting for the three months ending March 31, 2018. In addition, display revenue will be included in our other revenue category and not reported separately. Going forward, other real estate revenue will be redefined as other revenue and will include revenue from new construction, dotloop, display, as well as from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $15.9 million, or 23%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $7.9 million increase in revenue share costs, a $4.8 million increase in data center and connectivity costs, a $1.0 million increase in headcount- related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, a $0.8 million increase in credit card and ad serving fees and a $1.4 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future years as we continue to incur more expenses that are associated with growth in revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $448.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $65.8 million, or 17%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased marketing and advertising expenses of $34.2 million, primarily related to advertising spend to attract consumers across online and offline channels, which supports our growth initiatives.\nIn addition to the increases in marketing and advertising, headcount-related expenses increased $20.5 million, including share-based compensation expense, due primarily to significant growth in the size of our sales team. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was also attributable to a $6.0 million increase in tradeshows and conferences expense and related travel costs, a $2.5 million increase in consulting costs to support our advertising initiatives, a $1.1 million increase in software, hardware and connectivity costs, and a $1.5 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future years as we continue to expand our sales team and invest more resources in extending our audience through marketing and advertising initiatives.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, were $320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $255.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $64.4 million, or 25%. Approximately $44.3 million of the increase related to growth in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, as we continue to grow our engineering teams to support current and future product initiatives. In addition, there was a $10.0 million increase in other non-capitalizable data content expense, a $5.4 million increase in the amortization of purchased data content intangible assets, a $1.3 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $1.1 million increase in software and hardware costs, and a $2.3 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAmortization expense included in technology and development for capitalized website development costs and software was $44.4 million and $43.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amortization expense included in technology and development related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions was $40.0 million and $38.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other data content expense was $35.4 million and $25.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amortization expense included in technology and development for purchased data content intangible assets was $10.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time as we continue to build new mobile and website functionality.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $210.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $121.2 million, or 37%. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the settlement of a lawsuit with Move, Inc. and certain related entities (collectively, \u201cMove\u201d) in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims. In addition, there was a $31.1 million decrease in professional services fees, primarily as a result of our settlement of litigation with Move, as we incurred $28.8 million in legal costs related to our litigation with Move for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, driven primarily by growth in headcount in shared corporate services to support our engineering and other teams, a $7.5 million increase in building lease-related expenses including rent, utilities and insurance, a $6.0 million increase in estimated legal liabilities, a $4.7 million increase in bad debt expense, a $3.7 million increase in city and state taxes, a $2.9 million increase in software and hardware costs, a $2.0 million increase in the loss on disposal of assets, a $1.0 million increase in travel expenses, and a $1.2 million increase in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase over time in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our business.\nImpairment Costs\nImpairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 consist of the $174.0 million non-cash impairment related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February\n2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. There were no impairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs were $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of our January 2017 acquisition of HREO and our September 2017 acquisition of New Home Feed, including legal and accounting fees. Acquisition-related costs were $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, including legal, accounting and tax fees.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses\nThere was no loss (gain) on divestiture of business for the year ended December 31, 2017. The gain on divestiture of business of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThere was no loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss on debt extinguishment was $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the partial repurchase of the 2020 Notes in December 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense primarily related to the 2021 Notes that were issued on December 12, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense primarily related to the 2020 Notes that we guaranteed in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia. For additional information regarding the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $66.0 million of the income tax benefit relates to a $174.0 million non-cash impairment we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the non-cash impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining $23.6 million of the income tax benefit primarily relates to our initial analysis of the impact of the rate decrease included in the Tax Act for the impact of the reduction in our net deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset. Income tax expense was not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 to 2016\n% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketplace revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premier Agent\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market Leader\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Marketplace revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>778,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Display revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>846,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>644,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of Total Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketplace revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premier Agent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market Leader\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Marketplace revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Display revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Overall revenue increased by $201.9 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Marketplace revenue increased by 40%, and display revenue decreased by 23%. There were approximately 140.1 million average monthly unique users of our mobile applications and websites for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 123.7 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2015, representing year-over-year growth of 13%. This increase in unique users increased the number of impressions and clicks we monetized in our marketplace and display revenue categories.\nMarketplace revenue grew to $778.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $555.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $222.2 million. Marketplace revenue represented 92% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 86% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily attributable to the $157.4 million, or 35%, increase in Premier Agent revenue. Premier Agent revenue was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits increased 33% to 5,323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3,991.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit increased by 1% to $0.114 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.112 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Beginning on February 17, 2015, the reported visits reflect the effect of Zillow Group's February 17, 2015 acquisition of Trulia.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in other real estate revenue, which increased by $67.5 million, or 192%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The increase in other real estate revenue was primarily a result of a 124% increase in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead or lease that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead and cost per lease advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in mortgages revenue, which increased by $26.9 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in mortgages revenue was primarily a result of a 153% increase in our average revenue per loan information request for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in average revenue per loan information request was primarily a result of our flagship mortgage advertising platform, Long Form, which yields higher revenue than our other mortgage advertising products, and increased consumer adoption of Long Form, which was driven by product enhancements that allow us to monetize our mortgages products more efficiently. There were approximately 30.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 46.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately 34%. We believe the decrease in the number of loan information requests submitted by consumers is due to our strategic decision to improve loan information request quality by requiring consumers to provide more information before a loan information request is submitted. We believe our mortgage product feature change creates a better experience for consumers and more valuable loan information requests for our lender advertisers. During the first half of 2015 we changed the pricing model for our mortgage advertising products from cost per click to cost per lead, which also may have contributed to growth in mortgages revenue.\nDisplay revenue was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $20.2 million. Display revenue represented 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in display revenue is primarily a result of our strategy to deemphasize display advertising in the user experience and instead focus on growth in marketplace revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $9.1 million, or 15%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in data center and connectivity costs, increased headcount-related expenses of $3.8 million, including share-based compensation expense, driven by growth in headcount, and a $3.6 million increase in credit card and ad serving fees, which were partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in printing costs and costs to generate leads for customers related to the Market Leader business that we divested on September 30, 2015 and a $0.7 million decrease in multiple listing services fees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $308.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $74.3 million, or 24%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased headcount-related expenses of $45.9 million, including share-based compensation expense, due primarily to significant growth in the size of our sales team. In addition to the increase in headcount-related expenses, marketing and advertising expenses increased by $30.1 million, primarily related to advertising spend to acquire shoppers across online and offline channels, which supports our growth initiatives. These costs were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, were $255.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $71.1 million, or 39%. Approximately $36.9 million of the increase related to growth in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, as we continue to grow our engineering headcount to support current and future product initiatives. Approximately $19.9 million of the increase related to an increase in amortization of website development costs and software. The increase in technology and development expenses was also attributable to a $9.4 million increase in other non-capitalizable data content expense, a $5.3 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, and a $2.5 million increase in loss on disposal of property and equipment, which were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in amortization of purchased content and a $1.6 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAmortization expense included in technology and development for capitalized website development costs and software was $43.8 million and $23.9 million, respectively, the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense included in technology and development related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions was $38.7 million and $33.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Other data content expense was $25.5 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense included in technology and development for purchased data content intangible assets was $4.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $185.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $147.0 million, or 79%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the settlement of a lawsuit with Move, Inc. and certain other parties in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was also a result of a $11.6 million increase in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, including the impact of growth in headcount as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, a $4.3 million increase in building lease-related expenses including rent, utilities and insurance, and a $1.1 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs were $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, including legal, accounting and tax fees. Acquisition-related costs were $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, including investment banking, legal, accounting, tax, and regulatory filing fees.\nRestructuring Costs\nThere were no restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $35.6 million. On February 17, 2015, in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, Zillow Group undertook a restructuring plan that resulted in a total workforce reduction of nearly 350 employees, primarily to eliminate overlapping positions in the sales and marketing functions related to Trulia's workforce at its Bellevue, Denver, New York and San Francisco locations. The restructuring plan was a result of the integration of Trulia's business and operations with and into Zillow Group's business. Employees directly affected by the restructuring plan were provided with severance payments, stock vesting acceleration and outplacement assistance. As of December 31, 2015, the restructuring plan was complete.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses\nThe gain on divestiture of business was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business. The loss on divestiture of business was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and relates to the September 2015 sale of our Market Leader business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment was $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the partial repurchase of the 2020 Notes in December 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interest expense for each year primarily relates to the 2020 Notes that we guaranteed in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, which accrue interest at 2.75% annually.\nOn December 12, 2016, Zillow Group issued the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2017. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, our interest expense increased in future periods related to the contractual coupon interest and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs that will be recognized in interest expense.\nFor additional information regarding the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have a material amount of current taxable income. Therefore, no material tax liability or expense has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with Zillow's August 20, 2015 acquisition of DotLoop, Inc. that can be used to realize certain deferred tax assets for which we had previously provided a full allowance.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the periods presented below. In the opinion of management, the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the data.

revenue increased sequentially in all quarters presented. In general, the strong increase in consumer adoption of our mobile applications and websites in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nwas reflected in the significant growth in unique users, which resulted in increased impression inventory, leads, and graphical display impressions we could monetize through our advertising products.\nPremier Agent revenue also increased sequentially in all quarters presented. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising product, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which may have increased the demand for our advertising platform. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nThe year-over-year quarterly increases in revenue were also attributable to year-over-year growth in other real estate revenue, which was primarily a result increases in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead, lease, or click that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace. Other real estate revenue was also positively impacted by increased advertising sales to new home builders through our New Construction platform.\nThe composition of revenue continues to shift from display revenue to marketplace revenue, as we continue to dedicate more of our advertising placements on search, map and home detail pages to our information marketplace products, which provide consumers with services that are directly relevant to home-related searches.\nPortions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. We believe our rapid growth may be masking the underlying seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth rate slows, we expect seasonal variances may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, costs and expenses peaked in the three months ended June 30th, primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses which were, in turn, primarily attributable to increased investment in marketing and advertising initiatives to attract consumers across online and offline channels during peak seasons for home sales activity. In addition, the average number of unique users and visits have historically peaked during the three months ended June 30th or September 30th, also consistent with peak residential real estate activity in the spring and summer months. Because the number of unique users and visits may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory which we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users and visits may result in seasonality of revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for each of the periods presented below.

Cash and cash equivalents balances consist of operating cash on deposit with financial institutions, money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less. Investments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consist of fixed income securities, which include U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, municipal securities, certificates of deposit and foreign government securities. Amounts on deposit with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. We believe that cash from operations and cash, cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOn February 17, 2015, we acquired Trulia in a stock-for-stock transaction. The total purchase price of Trulia was approximately $2.0 billion. We have included Trulia's results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia had a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, as a result of the acquisition, Zillow Group entered into a supplemental indenture in respect of the 2020 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $230.0 million, which supplemental indenture provides, among other things, that, at the effective time of the Trulia acquisition, (i) each outstanding 2020 Note is no longer convertible into shares of Trulia common stock and is convertible solely into shares of Zillow Group Class A common stock, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes, and (ii) Zillow Group guaranteed all of the obligations of Trulia under the 2020 Notes and related indenture. The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes is due on December 15, 2020 if not earlier converted or redeemed. Interest is payable on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.75% semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. In December 2016, the Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes discussed below to repurchase $219.9 million aggregate principal of the 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions.\nHolders of the 2020 Notes may convert all or any portion of their notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. In connection with the supplemental indenture in respect of the 2020 Notes, the conversion ratio immediately prior to the effective time of the Trulia Merger of 27.8303 shares of Trulia common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes was adjusted to 12.3567 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes based on the exchange ratio of 0.444 per the Merger Agreement. This was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.93 per share of our Class A common stock. In connection with the August 2015 distribution of shares of our Class C capital stock as a dividend to our Class A and Class B common shareholders, the conversion ratio has been further adjusted to 41.4550 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $24.12 per\nshare of our Class A common stock. The conversion ratio will be adjusted for certain dilutive events and will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the notes). The conversion option of the 2020 Notes has no cash settlement provisions. The conversion option does not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as it is indexed to our own stock.\nThe 2020 Notes are redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part on or after December 20, 2018, if the last reported sale price per share of our Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.\nFor additional information regarding the 2020 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2016, Zillow Group issued $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, which amount includes the exercise in full of the $60.0 million over-allotment option, to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as the initial purchaser of the 2021 Notes in a private offering to the initial purchaser in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) for resale to qualified institutional buyers as defined in, and pursuant to, Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2017. The 2021 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class C capital stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's election. The 2021 Notes will mature on December 1, 2021, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $12.2 million related to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, including approximately $11.5 million in fees to the initial purchaser, which amount was paid out of the gross proceeds from the note offering.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were approximately $447.8 million, after deducting fees and expenses. The Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. In addition, the Company used approximately $36.6 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes to pay the cost of Capped Call Confirmations as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. The Company used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2021, the 2021 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the 2021 Notes only under certain conditions, none of which conditions have been satisfied as of December 31, 2017. On or after September 1, 2021, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at their option at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions of the 2021 Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class C capital stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class C capital stock, at its election. The conversion rate will initially be 19.0985 shares of Class C capital stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.36 per share of Class C capital stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2021 Notes, at its option, on or after December 6, 2019, under certain circumstances at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes).\nWe may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to December 6, 2019. We may redeem the 2021 Notes for cash, at our option, in whole or in part on or after December 6, 2019, if the last reported sale price per share of our Class C capital stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.\nFor additional information regarding the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, we acquired HREO for an immaterial amount. A substantial majority of the purchase price for HREO has been allocated to goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn June 2017, we purchased an equity interest in a privately held corporation for approximately $10.0 million. For additional information regarding the equity interest, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2017, we acquired New Home Feed for an immaterial amount. A substantial majority of the purchase price for New Home Feed has been allocated to goodwill and an intangible asset.\nThe following table presents selected cash flow data for the periods presented:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(247,394 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,719 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities\nOur operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from real estate professionals, mortgage professionals, rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments for marketing and advertising activities and employee benefits and compensation. Additionally, uses of cash from operating activities include costs associated with operating our mobile applications and websites and other general corporate expenditures.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $258.2 million. This was primarily driven by a net loss of $94.4 million, adjusted by a non-cash impairment charge of $174.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $110.2 million, share-based compensation expense of $113.6 million, an $89.6 million non-cash change in our net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance as a result of the non-cash impairment charge and the rate decrease included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the 2021 Notes of $18.0 million, an increase in bad debt expense of $7.3 million, a change in deferred rent of $7.1 million and a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $5.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $5.9 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily due to a $21.2 million increase in accounts receivable driven by an increase in revenue, a $19.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to growth in our business, partially offset by a $10.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets driven primarily by the timing of payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.6 million. This was driven by a net loss of $220.4 million, including the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit for $130.0 million in June 2016, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $106.9 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $100.6 million, a loss on debt extinguishment of $22.8 million, a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $3.7 million, an increase in bad debt expense of $2.7 million, an increase in the balance of deferred rent of $1.7 million, amortization of bond premium of $1.5 million, a $1.4 million gain on the divestiture of a business, a $1.4 million non-cash change in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments, and amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the 2021 Notes of $0.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash\nprovided by operating activities by $8.9 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a $13.3 million decrease in accounts receivable driven by the timing of payments received, a $13.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by the timing of payments made, and a $12.5 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits due primarily to an increase in sales commissions driven by increased sales as well as the timing of payroll.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.7 million. This was driven by a net loss of $148.9 million, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $105.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $75.4 million, non-cash restructuring costs of $19.0 million, a $3.9 million non-cash loss on divestiture of businesses, net, bad debt expense of $3.2 million, a $2.9 million non-cash change in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with our acquisition of DotLoop, Inc., an increase in the balance of deferred rent of $2.6 million, amortization of bond premium of $2.5 million, and a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $1.4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities by $38.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities include the purchase and sale or maturity of investments, the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets, the purchase of cost method investments, net cash paid in connection with acquisitions and proceeds from divestiture of businesses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $247.4 million. This was primarily the result of $147.8 million of net purchases of investments, $78.6 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets, $11.5 million paid in connection with acquisitions, and approximately $10.0 million related to the purchase of a cost method investment, partially offset by $0.6 million in proceeds from our August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $65.7 million. This was primarily the result of $71.7 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets, $16.3 million paid in connection with our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, $10.0 million related to the purchase of a cost method investment, partially offset by $29.1 million of net maturities and sales of investments and $3.2 million in proceeds from the divestiture of a business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $64.4 million. This was primarily the result of $173.4 million of net cash acquired in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, $36.0 million of net proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, and $23.4 million in proceeds from the divestiture of businesses, partially offset by $104.2 million paid in connection with our acquisition of DotLoop, Inc., $68.1 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets and a $3.9 million decrease in restricted cash.\nThe increases in capital expenditures and intangible assets during all three periods reflect our continued investments in support of business growth. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our business to provide for the continued innovation in our products and services in 2018 and thereafter.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our financing activities primarily related to the exercise of employee option awards. The proceeds from the exercise of option awards for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $98.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes, net of issuance costs, were $447.8 million. The Company also paid approximately $36.6 million in premiums for certain Capped Call Confirmations in December 2016. The Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds\nfrom the issuance of the 2021 Notes to repurchase $219.9 million aggregate principal of the 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. The proceeds from the exercise of option awards for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $31.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the proceeds from the exercise of option awards were $24.4 million. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 million of equity awards were withheld for tax liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We do not believe that the surety bonds will have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support. For additional information regarding the surety bonds, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements under the subsection titled \u201cSurety Bonds\u201d.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, unaudited) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2021 Notes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>460,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>460,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 2021 Notes (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 Notes (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 2020 Notes (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>886,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>558,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes is due on December 1, 2021 if not earlier converted or redeemed. \n (2) The stated interest rate on the 2021 Notes is 2.00%. \n (3) The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes is due on December 15, 2020 if not earlier converted or redeemed. \n (4) The stated interest rate on the 2020 Notes is 2.75%. \n (5) Our operating lease obligations consist of various operating leases for office space under noncancelable operating lease agreements. For additional information regarding our operating leases, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \n (6) We have noncancelable purchase obligations for content related to our mobile applications and websites. For additional information regarding our purchase obligations, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  We have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment due primarily to our significant net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn the course of business, we are required to provide financial commitments in the form of surety bonds to third parties as a guarantee of our performance on and our compliance with certain obligations. If we were to fail to perform or comply with these obligations, any draws upon surety bonds issued on our behalf would then trigger our payment obligation to the surety bond issuer. We have outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and software development costs, recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives, share-based compensation, income taxes, business combinations, and the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue. Incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a customer contract in a transaction that results in the deferral of revenue are expensed as incurred.\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. In addition, Market Leader revenue is included in our results of operations in Marketplace revenue from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015.\nPremier Agent revenue is derived from our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms.\nWe offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control\ntheir budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms.\nFrom 2012 through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had primarily charged customers for our Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. With this pricing method, we recognized revenue related to our impression-based Premier Agent product based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list during the period multiplied by the contracted maximum cost per impression, or (ii) the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered, typically over a period of six months or twelve months and then month-to-month thereafter.\nWe continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulia's products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nOther real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis whereby we recognize revenue as leads are delivered to rental professionals or as qualified leases are confirmed. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis whereby revenue is recognized based on the contractual spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nMortgages revenue primarily includes marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services. Mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform, for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. For our Long Form and Custom Quote cost per lead mortgage marketing products, generally, participating qualified mortgage professionals make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. In Zillow Group's Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive consumer contact information. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from participating mortgage professionals. We only charge mortgage professionals a fee when users contact mortgage professionals through Long Form or Custom Quotes. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a user contacts a mortgage professional through Zillow Group's mortgages platform.\nMarket Leader revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of a comprehensive premium software-as-a-service based marketing product typically sold to real estate professionals as a bundle of products under a fixed fee subscription. Market Leader became part of Zillow Group through Zillow Group's February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and was divested as of September 30, 2015.\nDisplay Revenue. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Impressions are the number of times an advertisement is loaded on a web page and clicks are the number of times users click on an advertisement. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our mobile applications and websites or on our partner websites and mobile applications, and fees are generally billed monthly. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users interacting with our mobile applications or websites.\nUpon our January 1, 2018 adoption of the new guidance issued by the FASB on revenue from contracts with customers, we expect that the number of estimates and assumptions we make will increase related to revenue recognition and the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including, but not limited to, estimates and assumptions related to variable consideration, practical expedients applied, and the period over which commission costs will be recognized.\nWebsite and Software Development Costs\nThe costs incurred in the preliminary stages of website and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by management to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the websites (or software) that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.\nCapitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases, currently estimated at one to two years. Estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed frequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or enhancements to the existing functionality.\nWe exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our mobile applications and websites, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets, or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of website and software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such review at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the other groups of assets and liabilities. If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of impairment to be recognized is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group.\nUnforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could adversely affect the fair value of our assets and could result in an impairment charge. Fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices, prices for comparable assets, or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows, multiples of earnings or revenues, and we may make various assumptions and estimates when performing our impairment assessments, particularly as it relates to cash flow projections. Cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective, and include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and forecasted operating performance, revenue trends and operating margins. These estimates could also be adversely impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments, or other market conditions affecting our industry.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value for option awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the option awards' vesting period. For restricted stock units and restricted units, we use the market value of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the date of grant to determine the fair value of the award, and we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards' vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model changes significantly, share-based compensation expense for future option awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. In valuing our option awards, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives. In addition, through December 31, 2016, we made assumptions about estimated forfeiture rates. Beginning on January 1, 2017, we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nRisk-free interest rate. Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option award's grant date.\nExpected dividend yields. Expected dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero to date.\nVolatility. The expected volatility for our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock is estimated using our historical volatility.\nExpected term. The weighted-average expected life of the option awards is estimated based on our historical exercise data.\nForfeiture rate. Prior to January 1, 2017, forfeiture rates were estimated using historical actual forfeiture trends as well as our judgment of future forfeitures. These rates were evaluated at least quarterly and any change in share-based compensation expense was recognized in the period of the change. We considered many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected terms utilized for our share-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from management's current estimates. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility and expected terms, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. In future periods, we expect our share-based compensation expense to increase as a result of our existing, unrecognized share-based compensation that will be recognized as the awards vest, and as we grant additional share-based awards to attract and retain employees.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.\nOur assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments, and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nSince inception, we have typically incurred annual operating losses, and accordingly, we have generally not recorded a material current provision for income taxes, though we have historically in certain instances recorded income tax benefits in connection with acquisitions. We generally do not expect any significant changes in the amount of our income tax provision until we are not routinely incurring operating losses.\nWe establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, new tax legislation or the change of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and how AMT credits are utilized; and (5) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment, implementation guidance was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a company to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under the accounting rules is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it should record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. Further, the implementation guidance also provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting pursuant to the accounting rules.\nIn the absence of the changes in the Tax Act, our tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $66.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect an overall statutory tax rate (including federal, state and foreign taxes) of approximately 24%, but in the absence of the Tax Act we would have expected an overall tax rate of approximately 38%. In 2018, we expect to record income tax benefits to the extent we generate additional operating loss carryforwards.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the\nacquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions for the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition, and is not amortized. We assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Typically, we choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and perform quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in our statements of operations.\nFor our most recent goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2017, we chose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis whereby we determined that our market capitalization is well in excess of the book value of our common stock, and therefore, we concluded that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible asset is not amortized, and we assess the asset for impairment on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. On an interim basis we consider if there are any events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, including, but not limited to, costs that could have a negative effect on future expected earnings and cash flows, changes in certain key performance metrics, and changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers. In our evaluation of our trade names and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset, we typically first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired. If so, we perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded in our statements of operations for the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $174.0 million related to our indefinite-lived Trulia trade names and trademarks intangible asset. In connection with our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of this asset during our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017, we identified factors that led us to conclude it was more likely than not that the $351.0 million carrying value of the asset exceeded its fair value. The most significant of such factors was a shortfall in projected revenue related to the Trulia brand compared to projections at the time the intangible asset was initially recorded in February 2015. Accordingly, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we performed a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the intangible asset and concluded that our best estimate of its fair value was $177.0 million. The valuation was prepared using an income approach based on the relief-from-royalty method and relied on inputs with unobservable market prices including the assumed revenue growth rates, royalty rate, discount rate and estimated tax rate. In connection with this impairment analysis, we evaluated our planned future use of the Trulia trade names and trademarks intangible asset and concluded that it remains appropriate to consider this asset to have an indefinite life.\nTo the extent there is a shortfall in actual estimated revenue attributable to the Trulia brand as compared to our estimated projections as of October 1, 2017, the date of our most recent annual impairment test, additional impairment could be recorded in future periods.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nFor information about our recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nOverview of our Business\nZillow Group, Inc. operates the leading real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help consumers find vital information about homes and connect with local professionals. Zillow Group's brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling and financing. The Zillow Group portfolio of consumer brands includes real estate and rental marketplaces Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, RealEstate.com and OutEast.com. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions to help real estate, rental and mortgage professionals maximize business opportunities and connect with millions of consumers. We also own and operate a number of business brands for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals, including Mortech, dotloop, Bridge Interactive and New Home Feed.\nOur living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes-including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market-attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow's mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 75 million homes, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, through our industry-leading mobile applications and websites. Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, rental and mortgage industries. These professionals include real estate, rental and mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue.\nMarketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Premier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising under our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs, which offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers grow and manage their businesses and brands. We offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. Other real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, through which we offer advertising products in our rentals marketplace and a suite of tools for rental professionals, New Construction, which includes advertising services for home builders, as well as revenue from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions and services and technology solutions for real estate professionals. Mortgages revenue primarily includes advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals, as well as revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform.\nDisplay revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites.\nEffective February 17, 2015, Zillow Group acquired Trulia, Inc. (\u201cTrulia\u201d), and each of Zillow and Trulia became wholly owned subsidiaries of Zillow Group. The total purchase price of Trulia was approximately $2.0 billion. We have included Trulia in Zillow Group's results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Because the Trulia acquisition occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, the information presented in this report with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to Zillow on a standalone basis prior to February 17, 2015 and to Zillow Group after February 17, 2015, whereas the information presented in this section with respect to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 relates to Zillow Group. Results of operations, including marketplace revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015 include Market Leader revenue from February 17, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the date we divested the Market Leader business, whereas the information presented in this report with respect to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 does not include Market Leader revenue. For additional information regarding the transaction with Trulia, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOverview of Significant Milestones and Results\nThe following is a summary of certain of our significant milestones for the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 In January, we completed the acquisition of Hamptons Real Estate Online (\u201cHREO\u201d), a Hamptons-focused real estate portal that provides buyers and renters with a specialized search experience and access to the area's most comprehensive for-sale, for-rent and vacant land listings. For additional information about the acquisition of HREO, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 In March, we launched Premier Agent on StreetEasy, New York City's leading real estate marketplace. By integrating StreetEasy with Zillow and Trulia, real estate professionals can now reach the largest audience of New York City home shoppers through one platform. In June, we implemented paid inclusion advertising for rental listings featured on StreetEasy, which significantly improved the quality of rental listings. \n \u2022 In March, we launched a new Dotloop application program interface platform for developers. The update makes it easier for developers to more seamlessly create new integrations for external real estate technology and transaction services with Dotloop's platform. \n \u2022 In April, we launched a new national advertising campaign, \u201cFinding Home\u201d, with several national TV spots featuring different stories that illustrate the diversity of home buyers today and their unique and varied challenges. \n \u2022 In May, we launched RealEstate.com, a new consumer real estate brand tailored to first-time home buyers. On RealEstate.com, buyers can search for homes in a completely new way-by the monthly payment and down payment they can afford. \n \u2022 In May, we announced our testing of the Zillow Instant Offers marketplace, a way for homeowners to sell their homes quickly by providing them with offers from investors and a comparative market analysis from a local real estate agent, as an estimate for what the home might fetch on the open market. In addition to investors being required to use an agent, should a homeowner select an investor's offer, Zillow will also offer to connect them with a local agent to represent them throughout the transaction. \n \u2022 In May, we launched Zillow Prize, a machine learning competition to improve Zestimate accuracy, with a grand prize of up to $1 million to the person or team who submits the most improved Zestimate algorithm model. \n \u2022 In June, we launched Builder Inform, a cloud-based data dashboard that provides robust anonymized consumer insight data from Zillow Group to residential builders to help them make decisions about future projects. Builder Inform allows builders to view and compare currently listed homes by type and location to help them understand what they should build based on consumer demand in a given zip code. \n \u2022 In June, we purchased an equity interest in a privately held corporation for approximately $10.0 million. For additional information regarding the equity interest, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 In September, we completed the acquisition of New Home Feed, a streamlined listing management technology that allows builders to input, manage and syndicate their listings across the web. For additional information about the acquisition of New Home Feed, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n \u2022 In October, we announced new products to help Premier Agents deepen their connections with clients and build their own personal brands through new technologies in the Premier Agent App, including My Agent. Zillow Group's evolving tech features will streamline agent-client communication and allow agents to appear as a client's only buyer's agent for listings they view on Zillow or Trulia. \n \u2022 In October, we announced the beta launch of Rental Inform, a cloud-based data dashboard of Zillow Group's exclusive real-time, robust rental market and aggregated, anonymized consumer insight data, which helps property management companies make more informed decisions about operations, marketing and investments. \n \u2022 In October, we announced plans to bring 3D Homes imaging technology to for-sale and for-rent listings. With the launch of the Zillow Group Home Capture App, homeowners and real estate professionals can capture 3D tours of their homes from their iPhones\u00ae and post to listings on Zillow and Trulia at no cost, providing home searchers with a new and more immersive way to envision themselves in a home. We plan to roll the feature out nationwide in the latter half of 2018. \n \u2022 The year ended December 31, 2017 represents the first full year in which we implemented our new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. \nWe have experienced significant revenue growth over the past three years. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, we focused on growing our marketplace revenue, which accounted for the majority of our revenue growth over that period. The increase in marketplace revenue resulted primarily from growth in our Premier Agent program. Our Premier Agent program represents the primary source of our revenue, and we believe it is more predictable than our other revenue sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated revenue of $1,076.8 million, $846.6 million and $644.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 27%, 31% and 98%, respectively. We believe achieving these levels of revenue growth was primarily the result of significant growth in traffic to our owned and operated mobile applications and websites-indicated by the average number of monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of 151.6 million, 140.1 million and 123.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 8%, 13% and 61%, respectively. This increase in unique users increases the number of impressions and clicks we can monetize in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In addition, we experienced a significant increase in our marketplace revenue, due primarily to growth in our Premier Agent program, which was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 6,314.4 million, 5,323.2 million and 3,991.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 19%, 33% and 61%, respectively. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $0.121, $0.114 and $0.112, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 6%, 1% and 24%, respectively. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which we believe increased the demand for our advertising platform from both existing and new advertisers. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising\nproduct, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 3,181 full-time employees compared to 2,776 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016.\nKey Metrics\nManagement has identified unique users and visits as relevant to investors' and others' assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnique Users\nMeasuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace revenue depends in part on our ability to enable real estate, rental and mortgage professionals to connect with our users, and our display revenue depends in part on the number of impressions delivered to our users. Growth in consumer traffic to our mobile applications and websites increases the number of impressions and clicks we can monetize in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In addition, our community of users improves the quality of our living database of homes with their contributions, which in turn attracts more users.\nWe count a unique user the first time an individual accesses one of our mobile applications using a mobile device during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses one of our websites using a web browser during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our mobile applications using different mobile devices within a given month, the first instance of access by each such mobile device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our mobile applications within a given month, the first access to each mobile application is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses our websites using different web browsers within a given month, the first access by each such web browser is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our websites in a single month, the first access to each website is counted as a separate unique user since unique users are tracked separately for each domain. Zillow, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments (as of March 2016) and RealEstate.com (as of June 2017) measure unique users with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures unique users with Adobe Analytics (formerly called Omniture analytical tools).\n Visits\nThe number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers' level of engagement with our mobile applications and websites. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to be transaction-ready real estate market participants and therefore more sought-after by our agent and other real estate professional advertisers.\nWe define a visit as a group of interactions by users with the Zillow, Trulia (as of February 17, 2015), StreetEasy (as of March 2017) and RealEstate.com (as of June 2017) mobile applications and websites, as we monetize our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products on these mobile applications and websites. A single visit can contain multiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains, web browsers, desktop or mobile devices. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks or months.\nZillow, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com measure visits with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures visits with Adobe Analytics. Visits to Trulia end after thirty minutes of user inactivity. Visits to Zillow, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com end either: (i) after thirty minutes of user inactivity or at midnight; or (ii) through a campaign change. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source (for example, via a search engine or referring link on a third-party website), leaves the mobile application or website, and then returns via another campaign or source.\n Basis of Presentation\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue.\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 also includes Market Leader revenue from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015.\nPremier Agent revenue is derived from our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms.\nWe offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms.\nFrom 2012 through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had primarily charged customers for our Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. With this pricing method, we recognized revenue related to our impression-based Premier Agent product based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list during the period multiplied by the contracted maximum cost per impression, or (ii) the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered, typically over a period of six months or twelve months and then month-to-month thereafter.\nWe continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulia's products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nOther real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis whereby we recognize revenue as leads are delivered to rental professionals or as qualified leases are confirmed. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis whereby revenue is recognized based on the contractual spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nMortgages revenue primarily includes marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services. Mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform, for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. For our Long Form and Custom Quote cost per lead mortgage marketing products, generally, participating qualified mortgage professionals make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. In Zillow Group's Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive consumer contact information. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from participating mortgage professionals. We only charge mortgage professionals a fee when users contact mortgage professionals through Long Form or Custom Quotes. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a user contacts a mortgage professional through Zillow Group's mortgages platform.\nMarket Leader revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of a comprehensive premium software-as-a-service based marketing product typically sold to real estate professionals as a bundle of products under a fixed fee subscription. Market Leader became part of Zillow Group through Zillow Group's February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and was divested as of September 30, 2015.\nDisplay Revenue. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Impressions are the number of times an advertisement is loaded on a web page and clicks are the number of times users click on an advertisement. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our mobile applications and websites or on our partner websites and mobile applications, and fees are generally billed monthly. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users interacting\nwith our mobile applications or websites. Growth in display revenue depends on continuing growth in traffic to our mobile applications and websites, continuing growth in traffic to our partner websites and mobile applications, migration of advertising spend online from traditional broadcast and print media, and effectiveness of display advertising versus other methods of online advertising.\nWe will begin reporting rentals revenue as a separate revenue category beginning with quarterly reporting for the three months ending March 31, 2018. In addition, display revenue will be included in our other revenue category and not reported separately. Going forward, other real estate revenue will be redefined as other revenue and will include revenue from new construction, dotloop, display, as well as from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses related to operating our mobile applications and websites, including associated headcount expenses, such as salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as credit card fees, ad serving costs paid to third parties, revenue-sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships, depreciation expense and costs associated with the operation of our data center and mobile applications and websites.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing activities, as well as headcount expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support, marketing and public relations employees, and depreciation expense.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development and testing of our mobile applications and websites, and equipment and maintenance costs. Technology and development expenses also include amortization costs related to capitalized website and development activities, amortization of software, amortization of certain intangibles and other data agreement costs related to the purchase of data used to populate our mobile applications and websites, and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including developed technology and customer relationships, amongst others. Technology and development expenses also include depreciation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense and bonuses for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, recruiting, corporate information technology costs and other administrative support. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlement costs, legal, accounting and other third-party professional service fees, rent expense, depreciation expense and bad debt expense.\nImpairment and Restructuring Costs. Impairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 consists of the $174.0 million non-cash impairment related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of workforce reduction expenses in connection with a restructuring plan and related contract termination costs related to operating leases as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia.\nAcquisition-related Costs. Acquisition-related costs consist of investment banking, legal, accounting, tax, and regulatory filing fees associated with acquisitions.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses. The gain on divestiture of business recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 consists of the gain recognized in connection with our August 2016 sale of our Diverse\nSolutions business. The loss on divestiture of business recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of the loss recognized in connection with our September 2015 sale of the Market Leader business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the partial repurchase of Trulia's Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) in December 2016.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on the 2020 Notes we guaranteed in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and interest on the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) we issued in December 2016. Interest is payable on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.75% semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Interest is payable on the 2021 Notes at the rate of 2.00% semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and in Canada. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not have a material amount of current taxable income. We have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 because, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have accumulated federal tax losses of approximately $1,014.0 million as of December 31, 2017, which are available to reduce future taxable income. We have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $21.4 million (tax effected) as of December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and how AMT credits are utilized; and (5) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment, implementation guidance was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a company to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under the accounting rules is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it should record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. Further, the implementation guidance also provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting pursuant to the accounting rules.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $66.0 million of the income tax benefit relates to a $174.0 million non-cash impairment we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the non-cash impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining $23.6 million of the income tax benefit primarily relates to our initial analysis of the impact of the rate decrease\nincluded in the Tax Act for the impact of the reduction in our net deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act and we have recorded provisional adjustments where we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete, including as related to the deduction limitations on compensation.\nIn the absence of the changes in the Tax Act, our tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $66.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect an overall statutory tax rate (including federal, state and foreign taxes) of approximately 24%, but in the absence of the Tax Act we would have expected an overall tax rate of approximately 38%.\nIncome tax expense was not material for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with Zillow's August 20, 2015 acquisition of DotLoop, Inc. that can be used to realize certain deferred tax assets for which we had previously provided a full allowance.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables present our results of operations for the periods indicated and as a percentage of total revenue:\n\n (3) See \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d below for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims. \n Adjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as it is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation; \n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss (gain) on divestiture of businesses; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on debt extinguishment; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax benefit (expense); and \n \u2022 Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented:\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\n\n Overall revenue increased by $230.2 million, or 27%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Marketplace revenue increased by 29%, and display revenue increased by 2%. There were approximately 151.6 million average monthly unique users of our mobile applications and websites for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 140.1 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2016, representing year-over-year growth of 8%. This increase in unique users increased the number of impressions and clicks we monetized in our marketplace and display revenue categories. In connection with the hurricanes that occurred during the summer of 2017, we worked closely with our Premier Agents and other advertisers in affected areas to help manage their advertising budgets. We estimate that relief initiatives, which included billing credits and other forms of advertiser assistance, as well as lost sales, impacted Premier Agent revenue by approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also experienced a temporary decline in traffic to our mobile applications and websites from consumers in impacted areas, which may have impacted the number of unique users and visits for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMarketplace revenue grew to $1,007.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $778.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $229.1 million. Marketplace revenue represented 94% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 92% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily attributable to the $157.3 million, or 26%, increase in Premier Agent revenue. Premier Agent revenue was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits increased 19% to 6,314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 5,323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit increased by 6% to $0.121 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.114 for the year ended December 31, 2016. We calculate Premier Agent revenue per visit by dividing the revenue generated by our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs in the period by the number of visits in the period. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which may have increased the demand for our advertising platform. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising product, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. We continue to evaluate this pricing method, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in other real estate revenue, which increased by $62.4 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other real estate revenue was primarily a result of a 66% increase in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead, lease, or click that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per\nclick advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace. Other real estate revenue was also positively impacted by increased advertising sales to new home builders through our New Construction platform.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in mortgages revenue, which increased by $9.5 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in mortgages revenue was primarily a result of a 54% increase in our average revenue per loan information request for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average revenue per loan information request was primarily a result of our flagship mortgage advertising platform, Long Form, which yields higher revenue than our other mortgage advertising products, and increased consumer adoption of Long Form, which was driven by product enhancements that allow us to monetize our mortgages products more efficiently. There were approximately 22.7 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 30.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 26%. We believe the decrease in the number of loan information requests submitted by consumers is due to our strategic decision to improve loan information request quality by requiring consumers to provide more information before a loan information request is submitted. We believe our mortgage product feature change creates a better experience for consumers and more valuable loan information requests for our lender advertisers.\nDisplay revenue was $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.1 million. Display revenue represented 6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in display revenue was primarily a result of the increase in unique users, which resulted in a greater number of impressions and clicks we monetized. We continue to deemphasize display advertising in the user experience and instead focus on growth in marketplace revenue.\nWe will begin reporting rentals revenue as a separate revenue category beginning with quarterly reporting for the three months ending March 31, 2018. In addition, display revenue will be included in our other revenue category and not reported separately. Going forward, other real estate revenue will be redefined as other revenue and will include revenue from new construction, dotloop, display, as well as from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $15.9 million, or 23%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $7.9 million increase in revenue share costs, a $4.8 million increase in data center and connectivity costs, a $1.0 million increase in headcount- related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, a $0.8 million increase in credit card and ad serving fees and a $1.4 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future years as we continue to incur more expenses that are associated with growth in revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $448.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $65.8 million, or 17%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased marketing and advertising expenses of $34.2 million, primarily related to advertising spend to attract consumers across online and offline channels, which supports our growth initiatives.\nIn addition to the increases in marketing and advertising, headcount-related expenses increased $20.5 million, including share-based compensation expense, due primarily to significant growth in the size of our sales team. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was also attributable to a $6.0 million increase in tradeshows and conferences expense and related travel costs, a $2.5 million increase in consulting costs to support our advertising initiatives, a $1.1 million increase in software, hardware and connectivity costs, and a $1.5 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future years as we continue to expand our sales team and invest more resources in extending our audience through marketing and advertising initiatives.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, were $320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $255.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $64.4 million, or 25%. Approximately $44.3 million of the increase related to growth in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, as we continue to grow our engineering teams to support current and future product initiatives. In addition, there was a $10.0 million increase in other non-capitalizable data content expense, a $5.4 million increase in the amortization of purchased data content intangible assets, a $1.3 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $1.1 million increase in software and hardware costs, and a $2.3 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAmortization expense included in technology and development for capitalized website development costs and software was $44.4 million and $43.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amortization expense included in technology and development related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions was $40.0 million and $38.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other data content expense was $35.4 million and $25.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amortization expense included in technology and development for purchased data content intangible assets was $10.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time as we continue to build new mobile and website functionality.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $210.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $121.2 million, or 37%. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the settlement of a lawsuit with Move, Inc. and certain related entities (collectively, \u201cMove\u201d) in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims. In addition, there was a $31.1 million decrease in professional services fees, primarily as a result of our settlement of litigation with Move, as we incurred $28.8 million in legal costs related to our litigation with Move for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, driven primarily by growth in headcount in shared corporate services to support our engineering and other teams, a $7.5 million increase in building lease-related expenses including rent, utilities and insurance, a $6.0 million increase in estimated legal liabilities, a $4.7 million increase in bad debt expense, a $3.7 million increase in city and state taxes, a $2.9 million increase in software and hardware costs, a $2.0 million increase in the loss on disposal of assets, a $1.0 million increase in travel expenses, and a $1.2 million increase in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase over time in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our business.\nImpairment Costs\nImpairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 consist of the $174.0 million non-cash impairment related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February\n2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. There were no impairment costs for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs were $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of our January 2017 acquisition of HREO and our September 2017 acquisition of New Home Feed, including legal and accounting fees. Acquisition-related costs were $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, including legal, accounting and tax fees.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses\nThere was no loss (gain) on divestiture of business for the year ended December 31, 2017. The gain on divestiture of business of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThere was no loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss on debt extinguishment was $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the partial repurchase of the 2020 Notes in December 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense primarily related to the 2021 Notes that were issued on December 12, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense primarily related to the 2020 Notes that we guaranteed in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia. For additional information regarding the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $66.0 million of the income tax benefit relates to a $174.0 million non-cash impairment we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the $351.0 million indefinite-lived intangible asset that we recorded in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia for Trulia's trade names and trademarks. For additional information about the non-cash impairment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining $23.6 million of the income tax benefit primarily relates to our initial analysis of the impact of the rate decrease included in the Tax Act for the impact of the reduction in our net deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset. Income tax expense was not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\n\n Overall revenue increased by $201.9 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Marketplace revenue increased by 40%, and display revenue decreased by 23%. There were approximately 140.1 million average monthly unique users of our mobile applications and websites for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 123.7 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2015, representing year-over-year growth of 13%. This increase in unique users increased the number of impressions and clicks we monetized in our marketplace and display revenue categories.\nMarketplace revenue grew to $778.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $555.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $222.2 million. Marketplace revenue represented 92% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 86% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily attributable to the $157.4 million, or 35%, increase in Premier Agent revenue. Premier Agent revenue was positively impacted by an increase in visits. Visits increased 33% to 5,323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3,991.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in visits increased the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace. Premier Agent revenue per visit increased by 1% to $0.114 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.112 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Beginning on February 17, 2015, the reported visits reflect the effect of Zillow Group's February 17, 2015 acquisition of Trulia.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in other real estate revenue, which increased by $67.5 million, or 192%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The increase in other real estate revenue was primarily a result of a 124% increase in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead or lease that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead and cost per lease advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace.\nThe increase in marketplace revenue was also attributable to growth in mortgages revenue, which increased by $26.9 million, or 61%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in mortgages revenue was primarily a result of a 153% increase in our average revenue per loan information request for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in average revenue per loan information request was primarily a result of our flagship mortgage advertising platform, Long Form, which yields higher revenue than our other mortgage advertising products, and increased consumer adoption of Long Form, which was driven by product enhancements that allow us to monetize our mortgages products more efficiently. There were approximately 30.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 46.8 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately 34%. We believe the decrease in the number of loan information requests submitted by consumers is due to our strategic decision to improve loan information request quality by requiring consumers to provide more information before a loan information request is submitted. We believe our mortgage product feature change creates a better experience for consumers and more valuable loan information requests for our lender advertisers. During the first half of 2015 we changed the pricing model for our mortgage advertising products from cost per click to cost per lead, which also may have contributed to growth in mortgages revenue.\nDisplay revenue was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $20.2 million. Display revenue represented 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in display revenue is primarily a result of our strategy to deemphasize display advertising in the user experience and instead focus on growth in marketplace revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $9.1 million, or 15%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in data center and connectivity costs, increased headcount-related expenses of $3.8 million, including share-based compensation expense, driven by growth in headcount, and a $3.6 million increase in credit card and ad serving fees, which were partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in printing costs and costs to generate leads for customers related to the Market Leader business that we divested on September 30, 2015 and a $0.7 million decrease in multiple listing services fees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $308.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $74.3 million, or 24%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased headcount-related expenses of $45.9 million, including share-based compensation expense, due primarily to significant growth in the size of our sales team. In addition to the increase in headcount-related expenses, marketing and advertising expenses increased by $30.1 million, primarily related to advertising spend to acquire shoppers across online and offline channels, which supports our growth initiatives. These costs were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses, which include research and development costs, were $255.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $71.1 million, or 39%. Approximately $36.9 million of the increase related to growth in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, as we continue to grow our engineering headcount to support current and future product initiatives. Approximately $19.9 million of the increase related to an increase in amortization of website development costs and software. The increase in technology and development expenses was also attributable to a $9.4 million increase in other non-capitalizable data content expense, a $5.3 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, and a $2.5 million increase in loss on disposal of property and equipment, which were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in amortization of purchased content and a $1.6 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAmortization expense included in technology and development for capitalized website development costs and software was $43.8 million and $23.9 million, respectively, the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense included in technology and development related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions was $38.7 million and $33.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Other data content expense was $25.5 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense included in technology and development for purchased data content intangible assets was $4.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $185.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $147.0 million, or 79%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the settlement of a lawsuit with Move, Inc. and certain other parties in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was also a result of a $11.6 million increase in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, including the impact of growth in headcount as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, a $4.3 million increase in building lease-related expenses including rent, utilities and insurance, and a $1.1 million increase in various miscellaneous expenses.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs were $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, including legal, accounting and tax fees. Acquisition-related costs were $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, including investment banking, legal, accounting, tax, and regulatory filing fees.\nRestructuring Costs\nThere were no restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $35.6 million. On February 17, 2015, in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, Zillow Group undertook a restructuring plan that resulted in a total workforce reduction of nearly 350 employees, primarily to eliminate overlapping positions in the sales and marketing functions related to Trulia's workforce at its Bellevue, Denver, New York and San Francisco locations. The restructuring plan was a result of the integration of Trulia's business and operations with and into Zillow Group's business. Employees directly affected by the restructuring plan were provided with severance payments, stock vesting acceleration and outplacement assistance. As of December 31, 2015, the restructuring plan was complete.\nLoss (Gain) on Divestiture of Businesses\nThe gain on divestiture of business was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business. The loss on divestiture of business was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and relates to the September 2015 sale of our Market Leader business.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment was $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the partial repurchase of the 2020 Notes in December 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interest expense for each year primarily relates to the 2020 Notes that we guaranteed in connection with the February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, which accrue interest at 2.75% annually.\nOn December 12, 2016, Zillow Group issued the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2017. As a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, our interest expense increased in future periods related to the contractual coupon interest and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs that will be recognized in interest expense.\nFor additional information regarding the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have a material amount of current taxable income. Therefore, no material tax liability or expense has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with Zillow's August 20, 2015 acquisition of DotLoop, Inc. that can be used to realize certain deferred tax assets for which we had previously provided a full allowance.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the periods presented below. In the opinion of management, the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the data. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of any future period. You should read the data together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n (3) See \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d below for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2016 includes the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims. \nThe following tables present our revenue by type and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented:\n\n Total revenue increased sequentially in all quarters presented. In general, the strong increase in consumer adoption of our mobile applications and websites in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nwas reflected in the significant growth in unique users, which resulted in increased impression inventory, leads, and graphical display impressions we could monetize through our advertising products.\nPremier Agent revenue also increased sequentially in all quarters presented. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we began meaningful testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product, our flagship advertising product, by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code in a dynamic way based on demand for impressions in that zip code. We believe Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted by the full implementation of the new pricing method for our Premier Agent product, which may have increased the demand for our advertising platform. We believe the increase in Premier Agent revenue was also due in part to increased advertising sales to current Premier Agents, including brokerages and other teams.\nThe year-over-year quarterly increases in revenue were also attributable to year-over-year growth in other real estate revenue, which was primarily a result increases in revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals. Growth in Zillow Group Rentals revenue was primarily attributable to increases in consumer adoption of our rentals information marketplaces, which in turn increased the likelihood of a lead, lease, or click that we monetize, and advertiser adoption of our cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click advertising products, as well as enhancements to our marketing products that improve the ways in which consumers and advertisers connect through the Zillow Group Rentals marketplace. Other real estate revenue was also positively impacted by increased advertising sales to new home builders through our New Construction platform.\nThe composition of revenue continues to shift from display revenue to marketplace revenue, as we continue to dedicate more of our advertising placements on search, map and home detail pages to our information marketplace products, which provide consumers with services that are directly relevant to home-related searches.\nPortions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. We believe our rapid growth may be masking the underlying seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth rate slows, we expect seasonal variances may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, costs and expenses peaked in the three months ended June 30th, primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses which were, in turn, primarily attributable to increased investment in marketing and advertising initiatives to attract consumers across online and offline channels during peak seasons for home sales activity. In addition, the average number of unique users and visits have historically peaked during the three months ended June 30th or September 30th, also consistent with peak residential real estate activity in the spring and summer months. Because the number of unique users and visits may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory which we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users and visits may result in seasonality of revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for each of the periods presented below. See \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d under \u201cResults of Operations\u201d above in this Item 7 for additional information about why we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and how we use Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2016 includes the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit in June 2016 whereby the Company paid $130.0 million in connection with a release of all claims.  Unique Users\nThe following tables set forth our unique users for each of the periods presented below. Refer to \u201cUnique Users\u201d above in this Item 7 for information about how we measure unique users. The average number of unique users has historically peaked during the three months ended June 30 or September 30, consistent with seasonal variances of home sales which generally peak in the spring and summer months. Because the number of unique users may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory which we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users may result in seasonality of revenue.\n Visits\nThe following tables set forth our visits for each of the periods presented below. Refer to \u201cVisits\u201d above in this Item 7 for information about how we measure visits. Consistent with the trend in our unique users discussed\nabove, the number of visits has historically peaked during the three months ended June 30 or September 30, consistent with seasonal variances of home sales which generally peak in the spring and summer months. Because the number of visits may increase the number of impressions we could monetize in our Premier Agent marketplace, this trend in the number of visits may result in seasonality of revenue.\n Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $762.5 million and $507.5 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents balances consist of operating cash on deposit with financial institutions, money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less. Investments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consist of fixed income securities, which include U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, municipal securities, certificates of deposit and foreign government securities. Amounts on deposit with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. We believe that cash from operations and cash, cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOn February 17, 2015, we acquired Trulia in a stock-for-stock transaction. The total purchase price of Trulia was approximately $2.0 billion. We have included Trulia's results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia had a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, as a result of the acquisition, Zillow Group entered into a supplemental indenture in respect of the 2020 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $230.0 million, which supplemental indenture provides, among other things, that, at the effective time of the Trulia acquisition, (i) each outstanding 2020 Note is no longer convertible into shares of Trulia common stock and is convertible solely into shares of Zillow Group Class A common stock, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes, and (ii) Zillow Group guaranteed all of the obligations of Trulia under the 2020 Notes and related indenture. The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes is due on December 15, 2020 if not earlier converted or redeemed. Interest is payable on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.75% semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. In December 2016, the Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes discussed below to repurchase $219.9 million aggregate principal of the 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions.\nHolders of the 2020 Notes may convert all or any portion of their notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. In connection with the supplemental indenture in respect of the 2020 Notes, the conversion ratio immediately prior to the effective time of the Trulia Merger of 27.8303 shares of Trulia common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes was adjusted to 12.3567 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes based on the exchange ratio of 0.444 per the Merger Agreement. This was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.93 per share of our Class A common stock. In connection with the August 2015 distribution of shares of our Class C capital stock as a dividend to our Class A and Class B common shareholders, the conversion ratio has been further adjusted to 41.4550 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $24.12 per\nshare of our Class A common stock. The conversion ratio will be adjusted for certain dilutive events and will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the notes). The conversion option of the 2020 Notes has no cash settlement provisions. The conversion option does not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as it is indexed to our own stock.\nThe 2020 Notes are redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part on or after December 20, 2018, if the last reported sale price per share of our Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.\nFor additional information regarding the 2020 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2016, Zillow Group issued $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, which amount includes the exercise in full of the $60.0 million over-allotment option, to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as the initial purchaser of the 2021 Notes in a private offering to the initial purchaser in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) for resale to qualified institutional buyers as defined in, and pursuant to, Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2017. The 2021 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class C capital stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's election. The 2021 Notes will mature on December 1, 2021, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $12.2 million related to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, including approximately $11.5 million in fees to the initial purchaser, which amount was paid out of the gross proceeds from the note offering.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were approximately $447.8 million, after deducting fees and expenses. The Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. In addition, the Company used approximately $36.6 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes to pay the cost of Capped Call Confirmations as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. The Company used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2021, the 2021 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the 2021 Notes only under certain conditions, none of which conditions have been satisfied as of December 31, 2017. On or after September 1, 2021, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their 2021 Notes at their option at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions of the 2021 Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class C capital stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class C capital stock, at its election. The conversion rate will initially be 19.0985 shares of Class C capital stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.36 per share of Class C capital stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2021 Notes, at its option, on or after December 6, 2019, under certain circumstances at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes).\nWe may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to December 6, 2019. We may redeem the 2021 Notes for cash, at our option, in whole or in part on or after December 6, 2019, if the last reported sale price per share of our Class C capital stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.\nFor additional information regarding the 2021 Notes, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, we acquired HREO for an immaterial amount. A substantial majority of the purchase price for HREO has been allocated to goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn June 2017, we purchased an equity interest in a privately held corporation for approximately $10.0 million. For additional information regarding the equity interest, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2017, we acquired New Home Feed for an immaterial amount. A substantial majority of the purchase price for New Home Feed has been allocated to goodwill and an intangible asset.\nThe following table presents selected cash flow data for the periods presented:\n Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities\nOur operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from real estate professionals, mortgage professionals, rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments for marketing and advertising activities and employee benefits and compensation. Additionally, uses of cash from operating activities include costs associated with operating our mobile applications and websites and other general corporate expenditures.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $258.2 million. This was primarily driven by a net loss of $94.4 million, adjusted by a non-cash impairment charge of $174.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $110.2 million, share-based compensation expense of $113.6 million, an $89.6 million non-cash change in our net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance as a result of the non-cash impairment charge and the rate decrease included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the 2021 Notes of $18.0 million, an increase in bad debt expense of $7.3 million, a change in deferred rent of $7.1 million and a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $5.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $5.9 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily due to a $21.2 million increase in accounts receivable driven by an increase in revenue, a $19.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to growth in our business, partially offset by a $10.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets driven primarily by the timing of payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.6 million. This was driven by a net loss of $220.4 million, including the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit for $130.0 million in June 2016, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $106.9 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $100.6 million, a loss on debt extinguishment of $22.8 million, a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $3.7 million, an increase in bad debt expense of $2.7 million, an increase in the balance of deferred rent of $1.7 million, amortization of bond premium of $1.5 million, a $1.4 million gain on the divestiture of a business, a $1.4 million non-cash change in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments, and amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the 2021 Notes of $0.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash\nprovided by operating activities by $8.9 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a $13.3 million decrease in accounts receivable driven by the timing of payments received, a $13.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by the timing of payments made, and a $12.5 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits due primarily to an increase in sales commissions driven by increased sales as well as the timing of payroll.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.7 million. This was driven by a net loss of $148.9 million, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $105.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $75.4 million, non-cash restructuring costs of $19.0 million, a $3.9 million non-cash loss on divestiture of businesses, net, bad debt expense of $3.2 million, a $2.9 million non-cash change in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax liability generated in connection with our acquisition of DotLoop, Inc., an increase in the balance of deferred rent of $2.6 million, amortization of bond premium of $2.5 million, and a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $1.4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities by $38.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities include the purchase and sale or maturity of investments, the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets, the purchase of cost method investments, net cash paid in connection with acquisitions and proceeds from divestiture of businesses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $247.4 million. This was primarily the result of $147.8 million of net purchases of investments, $78.6 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets, $11.5 million paid in connection with acquisitions, and approximately $10.0 million related to the purchase of a cost method investment, partially offset by $0.6 million in proceeds from our August 2016 sale of our Diverse Solutions business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $65.7 million. This was primarily the result of $71.7 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets, $16.3 million paid in connection with our February 2016 acquisition of Naked Apartments and our August 2016 acquisition of Bridge Interactive, $10.0 million related to the purchase of a cost method investment, partially offset by $29.1 million of net maturities and sales of investments and $3.2 million in proceeds from the divestiture of a business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $64.4 million. This was primarily the result of $173.4 million of net cash acquired in connection with our February 2015 acquisition of Trulia, $36.0 million of net proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, and $23.4 million in proceeds from the divestiture of businesses, partially offset by $104.2 million paid in connection with our acquisition of DotLoop, Inc., $68.1 million of purchases for property and equipment and intangible assets and a $3.9 million decrease in restricted cash.\nThe increases in capital expenditures and intangible assets during all three periods reflect our continued investments in support of business growth. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our business to provide for the continued innovation in our products and services in 2018 and thereafter.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our financing activities primarily related to the exercise of employee option awards. The proceeds from the exercise of option awards for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $98.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes, net of issuance costs, were $447.8 million. The Company also paid approximately $36.6 million in premiums for certain Capped Call Confirmations in December 2016. The Company used approximately $370.2 million of the net proceeds\nfrom the issuance of the 2021 Notes to repurchase $219.9 million aggregate principal of the 2020 Notes in privately negotiated transactions. The proceeds from the exercise of option awards for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $31.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the proceeds from the exercise of option awards were $24.4 million. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 million of equity awards were withheld for tax liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We do not believe that the surety bonds will have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support. For additional information regarding the surety bonds, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements under the subsection titled \u201cSurety Bonds\u201d.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) The aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes is due on December 1, 2021 if not earlier converted or redeemed. \n (2) The stated interest rate on the 2021 Notes is 2.00%. \n (3) The aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes is due on December 15, 2020 if not earlier converted or redeemed. \n (4) The stated interest rate on the 2020 Notes is 2.75%. \n (5) Our operating lease obligations consist of various operating leases for office space under noncancelable operating lease agreements. For additional information regarding our operating leases, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \n (6) We have noncancelable purchase obligations for content related to our mobile applications and websites. For additional information regarding our purchase obligations, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  We have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment due primarily to our significant net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn the course of business, we are required to provide financial commitments in the form of surety bonds to third parties as a guarantee of our performance on and our compliance with certain obligations. If we were to fail to perform or comply with these obligations, any draws upon surety bonds issued on our behalf would then trigger our payment obligation to the surety bond issuer. We have outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and software development costs, recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives, share-based compensation, income taxes, business combinations, and the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue. Incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a customer contract in a transaction that results in the deferral of revenue are expensed as incurred.\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue consists primarily of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. In addition, Market Leader revenue is included in our results of operations in Marketplace revenue from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015.\nPremier Agent revenue is derived from our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms.\nWe offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control\ntheir budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms.\nFrom 2012 through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had primarily charged customers for our Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression. With this pricing method, we recognized revenue related to our impression-based Premier Agent product based on the lesser of (i) the actual number of impressions delivered on our buyer's agent list during the period multiplied by the contracted maximum cost per impression, or (ii) the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered, typically over a period of six months or twelve months and then month-to-month thereafter.\nWe continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulia's products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nOther real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis whereby we recognize revenue as leads are delivered to rental professionals or as qualified leases are confirmed. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis whereby revenue is recognized based on the contractual spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered.\nMortgages revenue primarily includes marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services. Mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform, for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. For our Long Form and Custom Quote cost per lead mortgage marketing products, generally, participating qualified mortgage professionals make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. In Zillow Group's Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive consumer contact information. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from participating mortgage professionals. We only charge mortgage professionals a fee when users contact mortgage professionals through Long Form or Custom Quotes. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment can then prepay additional funds to continue to participate in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a user contacts a mortgage professional through Zillow Group's mortgages platform.\nMarket Leader revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of a comprehensive premium software-as-a-service based marketing product typically sold to real estate professionals as a bundle of products under a fixed fee subscription. Market Leader became part of Zillow Group through Zillow Group's February 2015 acquisition of Trulia and was divested as of September 30, 2015.\nDisplay Revenue. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Impressions are the number of times an advertisement is loaded on a web page and clicks are the number of times users click on an advertisement. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our mobile applications and websites or on our partner websites and mobile applications, and fees are generally billed monthly. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users interacting with our mobile applications or websites.\nUpon our January 1, 2018 adoption of the new guidance issued by the FASB on revenue from contracts with customers, we expect that the number of estimates and assumptions we make will increase related to revenue recognition and the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including, but not limited to, estimates and assumptions related to variable consideration, practical expedients applied, and the period over which commission costs will be recognized.\nWebsite and Software Development Costs\nThe costs incurred in the preliminary stages of website and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by management to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the websites (or software) that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.\nCapitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases, currently estimated at one to two years. Estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed frequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or enhancements to the existing functionality.\nWe exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our mobile applications and websites, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets, or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of website and software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such review at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the other groups of assets and liabilities. If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of impairment to be recognized is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group.\nUnforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could adversely affect the fair value of our assets and could result in an impairment charge. Fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices, prices for comparable assets, or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows, multiples of earnings or revenues, and we may make various assumptions and estimates when performing our impairment assessments, particularly as it relates to cash flow projections. Cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective, and include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and forecasted operating performance, revenue trends and operating margins. These estimates could also be adversely impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments, or other market conditions affecting our industry.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value for option awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the option awards' vesting period. For restricted stock units and restricted units, we use the market value of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the date of grant to determine the fair value of the award, and we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards' vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model changes significantly, share-based compensation expense for future option awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. In valuing our option awards, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives. In addition, through December 31, 2016, we made assumptions about estimated forfeiture rates. Beginning on January 1, 2017, we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nRisk-free interest rate. Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option award's grant date.\nExpected dividend yields. Expected dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero to date.\nVolatility. The expected volatility for our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock is estimated using our historical volatility.\nExpected term. The weighted-average expected life of the option awards is estimated based on our historical exercise data.\nForfeiture rate. Prior to January 1, 2017, forfeiture rates were estimated using historical actual forfeiture trends as well as our judgment of future forfeitures. These rates were evaluated at least quarterly and any change in share-based compensation expense was recognized in the period of the change. We considered many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected terms utilized for our share-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from management's current estimates. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility and expected terms, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. In future periods, we expect our share-based compensation expense to increase as a result of our existing, unrecognized share-based compensation that will be recognized as the awards vest, and as we grant additional share-based awards to attract and retain employees.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.\nOur assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments, and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nSince inception, we have typically incurred annual operating losses, and accordingly, we have generally not recorded a material current provision for income taxes, though we have historically in certain instances recorded income tax benefits in connection with acquisitions. We generally do not expect any significant changes in the amount of our income tax provision until we are not routinely incurring operating losses.\nWe establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, new tax legislation or the change of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and how AMT credits are utilized; and (5) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment, implementation guidance was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a company to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under the accounting rules is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it should record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. Further, the implementation guidance also provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting pursuant to the accounting rules.\nIn the absence of the changes in the Tax Act, our tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $66.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect an overall statutory tax rate (including federal, state and foreign taxes) of approximately 24%, but in the absence of the Tax Act we would have expected an overall tax rate of approximately 38%. In 2018, we expect to record income tax benefits to the extent we generate additional operating loss carryforwards.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the\nacquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions for the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition, and is not amortized. We assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Typically, we choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and perform quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in our statements of operations.\nFor our most recent goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2017, we chose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis whereby we determined that our market capitalization is well in excess of the book value of our common stock, and therefore, we concluded that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible asset is not amortized, and we assess the asset for impairment on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. On an interim basis we consider if there are any events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, including, but not limited to, costs that could have a negative effect on future expected earnings and cash flows, changes in certain key performance metrics, and changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers. In our evaluation of our trade names and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset, we typically first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired. If so, we perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded in our statements of operations for the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $174.0 million related to our indefinite-lived Trulia trade names and trademarks intangible asset. In connection with our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of this asset during our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017, we identified factors that led us to conclude it was more likely than not that the $351.0 million carrying value of the asset exceeded its fair value. The most significant of such factors was a shortfall in projected revenue related to the Trulia brand compared to projections at the time the intangible asset was initially recorded in February 2015. Accordingly, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we performed a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the intangible asset and concluded that our best estimate of its fair value was $177.0 million. The valuation was prepared using an income approach based on the relief-from-royalty method and relied on inputs with unobservable market prices including the assumed revenue growth rates, royalty rate, discount rate and estimated tax rate. In connection with this impairment analysis, we evaluated our planned future use of the Trulia trade names and trademarks intangible asset and concluded that it remains appropriate to consider this asset to have an indefinite life.\nTo the extent there is a shortfall in actual estimated revenue attributable to the Trulia brand as compared to our estimated projections as of October 1, 2017, the date of our most recent annual impairment test, additional impairment could be recorded in future periods.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
