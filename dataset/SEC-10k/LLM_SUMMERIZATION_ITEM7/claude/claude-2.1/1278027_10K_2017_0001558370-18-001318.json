Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements\u201d below and elsewhere in this report. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nGeneral\nWe manufacture, sell and distribute a diverse portfolio of branded, high quality, shelf-stable and frozen foods and household products, many of which have leading regional or national market shares. In general, we position our branded products to appeal to the consumer desiring a high quality and reasonably priced product. We complement our branded product retail sales with institutional and foodservice sales and private label sales.\nOur company has been built upon a successful track record of acquisition-driven growth. Our goal is to continue to increase sales, profitability and cash flows through strategic acquisitions, new product development and organic growth. We intend to implement our growth strategy through the following initiatives: expanding our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary branded businesses, continuing to develop new products and delivering them to market quickly, leveraging our multiple channel sales and distribution system and continuing to focus on higher growth customers and distribution channels.\nSince 1996, we have successfully acquired and integrated more than 45 brands into our company. Most recently, on October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Back to Nature Foods Company, LLC and related entities from Brynwood Partners VI L.P., Mondel\u0113z International and certain other sellers. On December 2, 2016, we acquired Victoria Fine Foods, LLC, and a related entity, from Huron Capital Partners and certain other sellers. On November 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the spices & seasonings business of ACH Food Companies, Inc. On November 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands from General Mills, Inc. And on July 10, 2015, we acquired Spartan Foods of America, Inc., and related entities, including the Mama Mary's brand, from Linsalata Capital Partners and certain other sellers. We refer to these acquisitions in this report as the Back to Nature acquisition,\u201d Victoria acquisition,\u201d spices & seasonings acquisition,\u201d Green Giant acquisition\u201d and Mama Mary's acquisition,\u201d respectively. Each of these recent acquisitions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions and the application of the acquisition method of accounting affect comparability between periods.\nWe are subject to a number of challenges that may adversely affect our businesses. These challenges, which are discussed above under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and below under the heading Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d include:\nFluctuations in Commodity Prices and Production and Distribution Costs. We purchase raw materials, including agricultural products, meat, poultry, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. Raw materials and other input costs, such as fuel and transportation, are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of raw materials, fuel, labor, distribution and other costs related to our operations can increase from time to time significantly and unexpectedly.\nWe attempt to manage cost inflation risks by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements and by implementing cost saving measures. We also attempt to offset rising input costs by raising sales prices to our customers. However, increases in the prices we charge our customers may lag behind rising input costs. Competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to rising costs.\n- 34 -\nWe expect to see moderate net cost increases for raw materials in the marketplace during 2018 and are currently locked into our supply and prices for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding, among others, maple syrup) through fiscal 2018 at a cost increase of less than 1% of cost of goods sold. During fiscal 2017, we had a minimal cost increase for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding, among others, maple syrup). To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs, implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if input costs begin to decline, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nConsolidation in the Retail Trade and Consequent Inventory Reductions. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. These customers are also reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products.\nChanging Consumer Preferences. Consumers in the market categories in which we compete frequently change their taste preferences, dietary habits and product packaging preferences.\nConsumer Concern Regarding Food Safety, Quality and Health. The food industry is subject to consumer concerns regarding the safety and quality of certain food products. If consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products, even as a result of a product liability claim or a product recall by a food industry competitor, our business could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates. Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada. Our sales to Canada are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and our sales for export to other countries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net sales to customers in foreign countries represented approximately 6.3%, 7.1% and 5.2%, respectively, of our total net sales. We also purchase a significant majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar could significantly increase our costs relating to the production of our maple syrup products to the extent we have not purchased Canadian dollars in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise entered into a currency hedging arrangement in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar. These increased costs would not be fully offset by the positive impact the change in the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have on our net sales in Canada. Our purchases of raw materials from other foreign suppliers are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. We also operate a manufacturing facility in Irapuato, Mexico for the manufacture of Green Giant frozen products and are as a result exposed to fluctuations in the Mexican peso. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses in Mexico are recognized in local foreign currency, and therefore we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our consolidated financial statements.\nTo confront these challenges, we continue to take steps to build the value of our brands, to improve our existing portfolio of products with new product and marketing initiatives, to reduce costs through improved productivity, to address consumer concerns about food safety, quality and health and to favorably manage currency fluctuations.\nCritical Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve trade and consumer promotion expenses; allowances for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and deferred tax assets; the determination of the useful life of customer relationship and amortizable trademark intangibles; the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; and the accounting for share-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.\n- 35 -\nOur significant accounting policies are described more fully in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nTrade and Consumer Promotion Expenses\nWe offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, in-store display incentives, slotting fees and coupons. The recognition of expense for these programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from our estimates.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.\nWe adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 applying the full retrospective transition approach to all contracts. Based on our comprehensive assessment of the new guidance, including our evaluation of the five-step approach outlined within the guidance, we concluded that the adoption will not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However, the adoption will result in a change in presentation of certain trade and consumer promotion expenses, specifically in-store display incentives also referred to as marketing development funds.\nWe previously recorded in-store display incentives or marketing development funds within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon the adoption of the new guidance, many of these cash payments will not meet the specific criteria within the new guidance of providing a distinct\u201d good or service, and therefore, will be required to be presented as a reduction of net sales. We currently anticipate that the impact of this change will result in a reduction of net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2018, the first year of adoption, with no impact to net income. See Note 2(s), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the expected adjustments to net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of the newly adopted revenue recognition standard.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out and average cost methods. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangibles with estimated useful lives are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted net future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating the fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur total assets include substantial goodwill and unamortizable intangible assets (trademarks). These assets are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or\n- 36 -\nunamortizable intangibles might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company's market capitalization with our company's carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization, we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value and recognizing a loss for the difference. As of December 30, 2017, we had $649.3 million of goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Our testing indicates that the implied fair value of goodwill is significantly in excess of the carrying value. Therefore, we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe test our unamortizable intangibles by comparing the fair value with the carrying value and recognize a loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of our unamortizable intangibles based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third party market value indicators. Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management, including future cash flows consistent with management's expectations, annual sales growth rates, and certain assumptions underlying a discount rate based on available market data. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate the future levels of sales and cash flows.\nAs of December 30, 2017, we had $1,483.6 million of unamortizable intangibles recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values, and the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value was 205.0% or more. The table below sets forth the book value as of December 30, 2017, of the trademarks of each of our brands whose fiscal 2017 net sales were equal to or exceeded 3% of our total fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands\u201d in the aggregate.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrand:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreen Giant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n422,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMrs. Dash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n189,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPirate Brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n152,800\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBear Creek Country Kitchens\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113,400\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpices & Seasonings(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrtega\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,339\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCream of Wheat\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaple Grove Farms of Vermont\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,627\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n470,235\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,483,601\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe spices & seasonings acquisition was completed on November 21, 2016. Includes trademark values for multiple brands acquired as part of the acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for goodwill and unamortizable intangibles, such as forecasted growth rates and discount rate, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable, but they are inherently uncertain. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\nWe completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and unamortizable intangibles. However, materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses. For example, an interim impairment analysis relating to one of our brands performed during fiscal 2014, resulted in our company recording non cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles for the brand of $26.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, during fiscal 2014. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued that brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. Accordingly, we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles of $4.5 million and $0.9\n- 37 -\nmillion, respectively, which are recorded in Impairment of intangible assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016. In addition, any significant decline in our market capitalization, even if due to macroeconomic factors, could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or unamortizable intangible assets are impaired, although a non-cash charge to operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Tax Expense Estimates and Policies\nAs part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Further, to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period, we include such charge in our tax provision, or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.\nThere are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term, and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes to the U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements when new regulations and legislation are enacted. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not that such tax position will be sustained based upon its technical merits.\nSee U.S. Tax Act\u201d below for a discussion of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and the impact it has had and may have on our business and financial results.\nPension Expense\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 40% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the amount recommended by our actuaries. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates, employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality, and the rate of salary increases. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expenses and obligations. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During fiscal 2017, we made total contributions to our pension plans of $8.7 million. During fiscal 2016, we made total contributions to our pension plans of $3.5 million. Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nOur discount rate assumption for our four defined benefit plans changed from 4.039% at December 31, 2016 to 3.45%-3.56% at December 30, 2017. While we do not currently anticipate a change in our fiscal 2018 assumptions, as a sensitivity measure, a 0.25% decline or increase in our discount rate would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.5 million to $0.6 million. Similarly, a 0.25% decrease or increase in the expected return on pension plan assets would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.3 million. We expect to make $1.1 million of defined benefit pension plan contributions during fiscal 2018.\nAcquisition Accounting\nOur consolidated financial statements and results of operations include an acquired business's operations after the completion of the acquisition. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which\n- 38 -\nrequires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nWe provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options, performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs) and common stock to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period, if any.\nPerformance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e., the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company's performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.\nThe fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on both historical and implied volatilities of our common stock over the estimated expected term of the award. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, have a 10-year term and cliff vest three years from the date of grant.\nWe recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management, adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods.\nProduct Recall\nOn November 14, 2014, we announced a voluntary recall for certain Ortega and Las Palmas products after learning that one or more of the spice ingredients purchased from a third party supplier contained peanuts and almonds, allergens that are not declared on the products' ingredient statements. A significant majority of the costs of this recall were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. The cost impact of this recall during fiscal 2015 was $1.9 million, of which $1.2 million was recorded as a decrease in net sales related to customer refunds; $0.5 million was recorded as an increase in cost of goods sold primarily related to costs associated with product retrieval, destruction charges and customer fees; and $0.2 million was recorded as an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses related to administrative costs. In fiscal 2015, we received an insurance recovery of $5.0 million related to this recall.\n- 39 -\nU.S. Tax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we refer to as the U.S. Tax Act.\u201d The changes in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, we are required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change in tax rates. The U.S. Tax Act lowers the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we revalued our prior year U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, which resulted in a discrete tax benefit of approximately $133.3 million. This tax benefit was partially offset by an increase in our blended state rate of approximately $5.8 million and a repatriation expense of $0.9 million.\nThe reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% will be effective for our fiscal 2018. We estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 25%.\nWe also expect to realize a cash tax benefit for future bonus depreciation on certain business additions, which, together with the reduced income tax rate, we expect to reduce our cash income tax payments.\nThe U.S. Tax Act also limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a corporate taxpayer to 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income. While we do not currently expect that our interest expense will exceed 30% of our adjusted taxable income, in any event we do not believe this limitation will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results because any interest that is non-deductible may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance on December 23, 2017 providing a one-year measurement period from a registrant's reporting period that includes the U.S. Tax Act's enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain, prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under ASC 740. As of December 30, 2017, we have recorded all known and estimable impacts of the U.S. Tax Act that are effective for fiscal 2017. Future adjustments to the provisional numbers will be recorded as discrete adjustments to income tax expense in the period in which those adjustments become estimable and/or are finalized.\nThe ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2018 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Act different from that currently contemplated.\n- 40 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentages of net sales represented by selected items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.

Our net sales represents gross sales of products shipped to customers plus amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling, less cash discounts, coupon redemptions, slotting fees and trade promotional spending.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of goods sold. The primary components of our cost of goods sold are cost of internally manufactured products, purchases of finished goods from co-packers, a portion of our warehousing expenses plus freight costs to our distribution centers and to our customers.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to selling our products, as well as all other general and administrative expenses. Some of these costs include administrative, marketing and internal sales force employee compensation and benefits costs, consumer advertising programs, brokerage costs, a portion of our warehousing expenses, information technology and communication costs, office rent, utilities, supplies, professional services, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses and other general corporate expenses.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense includes the amortization expense associated with customer relationships, amortizable trademarks and other intangibles.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets represents a reduction of the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets to fair value when the carrying value of the assets is no longer recoverable.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense includes interest relating to our outstanding indebtedness, amortization of bond discount and amortization of deferred debt financing costs (net of interest income).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt includes costs relating to the retirement of indebtedness, including repurchase premium, if any, and write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount, if any.\nOther Income. Other income includes expense and/or income resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\n- 41 -\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain disclosures in this report include non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) in our consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows.\nBase Business Net Sales. Base business net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to measure operating performance. We define base business net sales as our net sales excluding (1) the impact of acquisitions until at least one full quarter of net sales from such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods and (2) net sales of discontinued brands. The portion of current period net sales attributable to recent acquisitions for which there is not at least one full quarter of net sales in the comparable period of the prior year is excluded. For each acquisition, the excluded period starts at the beginning of the most recent fiscal period being compared and ends on the last day of the quarter in which the first anniversary of the date of acquisition occurs, and the period from the date of acquisition to the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred. For discontinued brands, the entire amount of net sales is excluded from each fiscal period being compared. Management has included this financial measure because it provides useful and comparable trend information regarding the results of our business without the effect of the timing of acquisitions and the effect of discontinued brands.\nThe definition of base business net sales set forth above, as it relates to acquisitions, has been modified from the definition we have used in prior annual reports. Under our previous definition of base business net sales, for each acquisition, the excluded period started at the beginning of the most recent fiscal period being compared and ended on the first anniversary of the acquisition date. We believe that it is more useful to measure base business net sales on a full quarter basis and accordingly have updated the fiscal 2016 versus 2015 base business net sales presentation below to reflect this change.\nA reconciliation of base business net sales to reported net sales for fiscal 2017 and 2016 follows (in thousands):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReported net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,668,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,391,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales from acquisitions(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(323,794)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31,437)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales of Rickland Orchards(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(528)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBase business net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,344,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,359,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReflects all net sales for Victoria and the spices & seasonings business for each period presented and net sales for Back to Nature for fiscal 2017.

EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses, integration, restructuring and consolidation expenses and amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up, gains and losses on the sale of assets) and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; loss on product recalls, including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs, loss on product recalls and distribution restructuring expenses because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However, management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income, net income (loss) or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity's ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity's profitability because they do not include costs and expenses for depreciation and amortization, interest and related expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses, income taxes, intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs, gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs, loss on product recalls and distribution restructuring expenses. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP amounts.\n- 43 -\nA reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 along with the

Net sales increased by $276.8 million, or approximately 20.0%, to $1.67 billion for fiscal 2017 from $1.39 billion in 2016. The net sales increase was due to an increase in unit volume of $287.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in net pricing of $10.7 million. The unit volume increase was primarily driven by an additional eleven plus months of net sales of the spices & seasonings business, acquired on November 21, 2016, an additional eleven months of net sales of Victoria, acquired on December 2, 2016, and three months of net sales of Back to Nature, acquired on October 2, 2017.\n- 45 -\nBase business net sales for fiscal 2017 decreased by approximately $15.0 million, or 1.1%. The decrease in base business net sales was driven by a decrease in unit volume of $4.3 million, or 0.3%, and a decrease in net pricing of $10.7 million, or 0.8%. Net sales of Green Giant frozen products, benefitting from the strong performance of new innovation products, increased $33.6 million, or 11.1%, and net sales of Pirate Brands, benefitting from new distribution gains, plus momentum from a strong back-to-school season and successful promotional events, increased $5.2 million, or 6.1%. Net sales of Green Giant shelf-stable products decreased $30.6 million, or 19.6%, primarily due to weak consumption trends and distribution losses with a key customer. Net sales of our maple syrup products decreased $7.0 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to the Company's decision during the first quarter of 2017 to discontinue certain private label sales. And net sales of Ortega decreased $3.0 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to heightened competitive activity. The overall decline in base business net sales in fiscal 2017 was concentrated in the first half of the year. Base business net sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 increased 1.2% compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016.\nThe spices & seasonings business and Victoria, each acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016, generated fiscal 2017 net sales of $260.7 million and $42.8 million, respectively, compared to our initial forecasts at the time of acquisition of $220.0 million of net sales for the spices & seasonings business and $41.0 million of net sales for Victoria.\nSee Note 15, Net Sales by Brand,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for detailed information regarding total net sales by brand for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 for each of our brands that equaled or exceeded approximately 3% of our fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands in the aggregate.\nThe following chart sets forth the most significant base business net sales increases and decreases by brand for fiscal 2017:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBase Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrand:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreen Giant - frozen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPirate Brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew York Style\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnderwood\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGrandma's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreen Giant - shelf stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(30.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaple Grove Farms of Vermont\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrtega\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMama Mary's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBear Creek Country Kitchens\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLas Palmas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpring Tree\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nB&M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBloch & Guggenheimer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrueNorth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmeril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBase business net sales decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $14.3 million, or 3.2%, to $462.2 million for fiscal 2017 from $448.0 million for fiscal 2016. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales was 27.7% for fiscal 2017 compared to 32.2% for fiscal 2016. Excluding the 2.5 percentage point impact due to product mix, gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.0 percentage points. Approximately 1.4 percentage points of the decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in warehousing and distribution costs and 0.6 percentage points of the decrease was due to a decrease in net pricing.\n- 46 -\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $205.2 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $30.5 million, or 17.4%. The increase was attributable to increased warehousing expenses of $12.8 million, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses of $11.4 million, selling expenses of $7.2 million (which includes increases on brokerage expenses of $5.9 million and $0.6 million of salesperson compensation) and consumer marketing expenses of $0.6 million, slightly offset by decreases of $1.3 million of distribution restructuring expenses and all other expenses of $0.2 million. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 0.3 percentage points to 12.3% for fiscal 2017 compared to 12.5% for 2016.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense increased $3.8 million to $17.6 million for fiscal 2017 from $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 due to the Back to Nature acquisition completed in fiscal 2017 and the spices & seasonings and Victoria acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets of $5.4 million for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards, as we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand during the second quarter of 2016 because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production.\nOperating Income. As a result of the foregoing, operating income decreased $14.6 million, or 5.7%, to $239.4 million for fiscal 2017 from $254.0 million for fiscal 2016. Operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.4% in fiscal 2017 from 18.3% in fiscal 2016.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense was $91.8 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $74.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to additional borrowings made in the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund the spices & seasonings acquisition and the Victoria acquisition and in the fourth quarter of 2017 to fund the Back to Nature acquisition, and our senior notes offerings in second quarter and fourth quarter of 2017. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt\u201d below.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2017 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $0.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. See Liquidity and Capital Resources -Debt\u201d below.\nOther Income. Other income for fiscal 2017 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.6 million. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense. Income tax (benefit) expense changed $137.0 million to a tax benefit of $(69.4) million in fiscal 2017 from a tax expense of $67.6 million for fiscal 2016. See U.S. Tax Act\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the recently enacted tax legislation on Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Without the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, our income tax expense for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately $57.1 million and our effective tax rate would have been 38.6%.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $424.9 million, or 44.0%, to $1,391.3 million for fiscal 2016 from $966.4 million for fiscal 2015. An additional ten months of net sales of Green Giant, acquired on November 2, 2015, and an additional almost six months of net sales of Mama Mary's, acquired on July 10, 2015, contributed $397.6 million and $19.4 million, respectively, to the overall net sales increase. In addition, net sales of the spices & seasonings business, acquired on November 21, 2016, and net sales of Victoria, acquired on December 2, 2016, contributed $28.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, to the overall net sales increase.\n- 47 -\nBase business net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $20.9 million, or 2.5%, to $816.8 million from $837.7 million for fiscal 2015. The $20.9 million decrease was attributable to a decrease in unit volume of $14.2 million, or 1.7%, a decrease in net pricing of $6.0 million, or 0.7%, and the negative impact of currency fluctuations on foreign sales of approximately $0.7 million, or 0.1%.\nA primary driver of the decline in base business net sales for fiscal 2016 was our syrup business. The net sales of those brands declined in the aggregate $7.7 million for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to maple syrup price deflation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, which resulted in increased competition in the maple syrup category and contractually mandated price reductions with certain of our foodservice customers. Another significant factor in the decline in base business net sales for fiscal 2016 was the TrueNorth brand, which declined $6.4 million, or 33.9%. The TrueNorth net sales decline was primarily the result of historically high almond prices in 2015. In response to increased almond costs, we increased the selling price for TrueNorth products, which had a negative impact on consumer demand. Although we rolled back pricing as almond prices began to return to historical norms, consumer demand did not return to prior levels. Base business net sales were also negatively impacted by net sales of our Ortega products, which decreased $3.7 million, or 2.6%. A portion of the decrease was attributable to the effects of the product recall we announced in November 2014, which caused an increase in net sales of Ortega in fiscal 2015 due to customers restocking inventory of products affected by the recall, partially offset by $1.2 million of customer refunds related to the recall. $1.5 million of the decrease in net sales of Ortega was due to a net pricing decrease in fiscal 2016.\nSee Note 15, Net Sales by Brand,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for detailed information regarding total net sales by brand for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 for each of our brands that equaled or exceeded approximately 3% of our fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands in the aggregate.\nThe following chart sets forth the most significant base business net sales increases and decreases by brand for fiscal 2016:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBase Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrand:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPirate Brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLas Palmas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrueNorth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(33.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaple Grove Farms of Vermont\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrtega\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMrs. Dash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpring Tree\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew York Style\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBase business net sales decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(20.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $158.4 million, or 54.7%, to $448.0 million for fiscal 2016 from $289.6 million for fiscal 2015. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.2% in fiscal 2016 from 30.0% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 2.2 percentage points. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by the acquisition of Green Giant. Gross profit percentage was also positively impacted by decreased costs for commodities, packaging and distribution for the base business and improved product mix, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact the decrease in base business sales volume had on cost absorption, a net reduction in base business pricing, and the impact of the write-off of Rickland Orchards inventory in connection with our decision to discontinue the brand. See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of this write-off.\n- 48 -\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $68.9 million, or 65.0%, to $174.8 million for fiscal 2016 from $105.9 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to the Green Giant acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses and distribution restructuring expenses increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2016. The remaining $58.9 million of the increase was attributable to increases in consumer marketing of $41.6 million, selling expenses of $8.7 million (which includes a $7.5 million increase in brokerage expenses and a $1.2 million increase in salesperson compensation), warehousing expenses of $7.4 million and general and administrative expenses of $1.2 million (primarily related to compensation). Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.5 percentage points to 12.5% for fiscal 2016 from 11.0% for fiscal 2015.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense increased $2.5 million to $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 from $11.3 million for fiscal 2015 due to the Victoria and spices & seasonings acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and the Green Giant and Mama Mary's acquisitions completed in fiscal 2015.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets of $5.4 million for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards, as we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the impairment of intangible assets related to Rickland Orchards.\nOperating Income. As a result of the foregoing, operating income increased $81.6 million, or 47.4%, to $254.0 million for fiscal 2016 from $172.4 million for fiscal 2015. Operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.3% in fiscal 2016 from 17.8% in fiscal 2015.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense increased $23.4 million, or 45.6%, to $74.5 million for fiscal 2016 from $51.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional indebtedness outstanding during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of the Green Giant acquisition, the spices & seasonings acquisition, and the Victoria acquisition. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\u201d below.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. We did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2015. See -Debt\u201d below.\nOther Income. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased $15.5 million to $67.6 million for fiscal 2016 from $52.1 million for fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for fiscal 2016 and 43.0% for fiscal 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity requirements include debt service, capital expenditures and working capital needs. See also, Dividend Policy\u201d and Commitments and Contractual Obligations\u201d below. We fund our liquidity requirements, as well as our dividend payments and financing for acquisitions, primarily through cash generated from operations and external sources of financing, including our revolving credit facility.\nCash Flows\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $251.9 million to $37.8 million for fiscal 2017 from $289.7 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects unfavorable working capital (comprised of changes in inventories, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses) comparisons to the fiscal year 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a\n- 49 -\nsignificant increase in inventory net of businesses acquired in 2017 compared to a decrease in inventory net of businesses acquired in 2016, and the timing of payments received from post-acquisition transition services agreements. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $161.2 million to $289.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $128.5 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the Green Giant acquisition, including the favorable impact of an increase in cash provided by working capital and higher net income for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $260.7 million to $220.5 million for fiscal 2017 from $481.2 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in payments made for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, and an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by an increase in capital spending. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 included expenditures for building improvements, purchases of manufacturing equipment, expenditures in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and capitalized interest.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 increased $143.3 million to $359.3 million from $216.0 million for fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year 2017 consisted of $914.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of our 5.25% senior notes and $395.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings, partially offset by $233.6 million repayment of our tranche A term loans, $571.0 million of repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings, $123.6 million of dividend payments, $19.5 million of debt financing costs and $2.0 million of payments of tax withholding on behalf of employees for net share settlement of share based compensation. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2016 decreased $551.4 million to $216.0 million from $767.4 million for fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to differences in the net effects of our equity offerings in March and August of 2016, prepayments of long-term debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. See -Debt\u201d below.\nCash Income Tax Payments. During fiscal 2017 we made cash tax payments of approximately $17.2 million even though we recorded a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes. See U.S. Tax Act\u201d above for a discussion of the impact and expected impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our cash income tax payments. Based on a number of factors, including amortization for tax purposes of our trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions, we realized a significant reduction in cash taxes in fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared to our tax expense for financial reporting purposes. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand, which resulted in a one-time cash taxes benefit of $17.3 million for fiscal 2016. We believe that we will realize a benefit to our cash taxes payable from amortization of our trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets for the taxable years 2018 through 2032. If there is a change in U.S. federal tax policy that reduces any of these available deductions or results in an increase in our corporate tax rate, our cash taxes payable may increase further, which could significantly reduce our future liquidity and impact our ability to make interest and dividend payments.\nDividend Policy\nFor a discussion of our dividend policy, see the information set forth under the heading Dividend Policy\u201d in Part II, Item 5 of this report.\nAcquisitions\nOur liquidity and capital resources have been significantly impacted by acquisitions and may be impacted in the foreseeable future by additional acquisitions. As discussed elsewhere in this report, as part of our growth strategy we plan to expand our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary brands. We have historically financed acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness, issuing equity and/or using cash flows from operating activities. Our interest expense has over time increased as a result of additional indebtedness we have incurred in connection with acquisitions and will increase with any additional indebtedness we may incur to finance future acquisitions. Although we may subsequently issue equity and use the proceeds to repay all or a portion of the additional indebtedness incurred to finance an acquisition and reduce our interest expense, the additional shares of common stock would increase the amount of cash flows from operating activities necessary to fund dividend payments.\n- 50 -\nWe financed the Mama Mary's acquisition, completed in July 2015, with cash on hand from the proceeds of a public offering of common stock we completed in May 2015. We financed the Green Giant acquisition, completed in November 2015, with additional indebtedness, and we repaid a portion of that additional indebtedness with the proceeds of a public offering of common stock we completed in March 2016. We financed the spices & seasonings acquisition, completed in November 2016, with cash on hand, including the net proceeds of our August 2016 public offering of common stock, and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. We financed the Victoria acquisition, completed in December 2016, with cash on hand and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. We financed the Back to Nature acquisition, completed in October 2017, with cash on hand and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. The impact of future acquisitions, whether financed with additional indebtedness or otherwise, may have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Agreement. In fiscal 2017, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility twice by amending and restating our senior secured credit agreement, first on March 30, 2017, and again on November 20, 2017.\nThe first refinancing, on March 30, 2017, reduced by 0.75% the spread over LIBOR or the applicable base rate on $640.1 million of tranche B term loans.\nOn April 3, 2017, we repaid all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans using a portion of the net proceeds of our registered public offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025.\nOn November 20, 2017, we again refinanced our senior secured credit facility. This second refinancing increased the principal amount of the tranche B term loans by $10 million to $650.1 million, reduced by 25 basis points the spread over LIBOR or the applicable base rate on the tranche B term loans and any revolving loans, increased the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $700 million, and extended the maturity date applicable to our revolving credit facility from June 2019 to November 2022.\nAt December 30, 2017, $650.1 million of tranche B term loans and no amount of revolving loans were outstanding under our credit agreement. During the first quarter of 2018, we made an optional prepayment of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. As of the date of this report, $600.1 million of tranche B term loans remains outstanding.\nOur credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries' assets except our and our domestic subsidiaries' real property.\nAt December 30, 2017, the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $2.2 million, was $697.8 million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar line of business as our company, subject to specified criteria. The revolving credit facility matures on November 21, 2022.\nThe entire $600.1 million principal amount of tranche B term loans outstanding are due and payable at maturity on November 2, 2022.\nInterest under the revolving credit facility, including any outstanding letters of credit is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, and LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, in each case depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.\nInterest under the tranche B term loan facility is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin of 1.00%, and LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. At December 30, 2017, the tranche B term loan interest rate was approximately 3.569%.\nFor further information regarding our credit agreement, including a description of optional and mandatory prepayment terms, and financial and restrictive covenants, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n- 51 -\n4.625% Senior Notes due 2021. On June 4, 2013, we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% senior notes to purchase or redeem all $248.5 million principal amount of our then existing 7.625% senior notes due 2018, to repay $222.2 million principal amount of our then existing tranche B term loans and approximately $40.0 million principal amount of revolving loans under our then existing credit agreement, and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses. We used the remaining net proceeds for our acquisition of Pirate Brands, completed in July 2013.\nInterest on the 4.625% senior notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.625% senior notes will mature on June 1, 2021, unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 4.625% senior notes as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 4.625% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 4.625% senior notes or exchanges of the 4.625% senior notes for equity securities or both, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 4.625% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 4.625% senior notes and/or exchanges of the 4.625% senior notes for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a more detailed description of the 4.625% senior notes.\n5.25% Senior Notes due 2025. On April 3, 2017, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. On November 20, 2017, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public 101% of their face value plus accrued interest from October 1, 2017, which equates to a yield to worst of 5.03%. The notes issued in November were issued as additional notes under the same indenture as our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 that were issued in April, and, as such, form a single series and trade interchangeably with the previously issued 5.25% senior notes.\nWe used the net proceeds of the April offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans, and to pay related fees and expenses. We used the net proceeds of the November offering to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We have used a portion of, and intend to use the remaining portion of, the net proceeds of the April and November offerings for general corporate purposes, which have included and could include, among other things, repayment of other long term debt or possible acquisitions.\nInterest on the 5.25% senior notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2017. The 5.25% senior notes will mature on April 1, 2025, unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% senior notes as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 5.25% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 5.25% senior notes and/or exchanges of the 5.25% senior notes for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a more detailed description of the 5.25% senior notes.\nDeferred Debt Financing Costs. During fiscal 2017, we wrote off and expensed $0.9 million of debt financing costs in connection with the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and less than $0.1 million in connection with the refinancing of our tranche B term loans. During fiscal 2016, we wrote-off and expensed $2.2 million of debt financing costs in connection with the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. During fiscal 2015, we\n- 52 -\ncapitalized $14.5 million of debt financing costs relating to the tranche B term loans, which are being amortized over the seven year scheduled term of the tranche B term loans.\nFuture Capital Needs\nOn December 30, 2017, our total long-term debt of $2,217.6 million, net of our cash and cash equivalents of $206.5 million, was $2,011.1 million. Stockholders' equity as of that date was $880.8 million.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations depends generally on our results of operations and the availability of financing. Our management believes that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow from operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund operations, meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, if any, and pay our anticipated quarterly dividends on our common stock.\nWe expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2018. Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 include anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 million to move equipment used in the production of certain Green Giant products from General Mills' Belvidere, Illinois manufacturing facility to an existing B&G Foods co-packer, approximately $2.0 million for new productivity projects, $5.5 million to fund infrastructure optimization projects, $3.6 million for IT infrastructure including cyber security, and approximately $12.4 million in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nSeasonality\nSales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or certain other annual events. In general our sales are higher during the first and fourth quarters.\nWe purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable vegetables, shelf-stable pickles, relishes, peppers, tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October, and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently, our liquidity needs are greatest during these periods.\nInflation\nWe are currently locked into pricing and supply for substantially all of our major commodities, other than maple syrup, through fiscal 2018 at a cost increase of less than 1% of cost of goods sold and will continue to manage inflation risk by entering into short term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements from time to time, and, if necessary, by raising prices. During each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we had a minimal cost decrease. To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs, implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if input costs begin to decline, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nContingencies\nSee Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2(s), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n- 53 -\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 30, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations and commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness, future minimum operating lease obligations, future purchase obligations and future pension obligations as set forth in the following table as of December 30, 2017.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt-principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,250,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,350,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n900,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt-interest(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n532,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n186,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n137,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n106,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,865,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n152,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n204,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,495,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,013,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected interest payments on long-term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding, scheduled maturity dates and interest rates at December 30, 2017.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements\u201d below and elsewhere in this report. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nGeneral\nWe manufacture, sell and distribute a diverse portfolio of branded, high quality, shelf-stable and frozen foods and household products, many of which have leading regional or national market shares. In general, we position our branded products to appeal to the consumer desiring a high quality and reasonably priced product. We complement our branded product retail sales with institutional and foodservice sales and private label sales.\nOur company has been built upon a successful track record of acquisition-driven growth. Our goal is to continue to increase sales, profitability and cash flows through strategic acquisitions, new product development and organic growth. We intend to implement our growth strategy through the following initiatives: expanding our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary branded businesses, continuing to develop new products and delivering them to market quickly, leveraging our multiple channel sales and distribution system and continuing to focus on higher growth customers and distribution channels.\nSince 1996, we have successfully acquired and integrated more than 45 brands into our company. Most recently, on October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Back to Nature Foods Company, LLC and related entities from Brynwood Partners VI L.P., Mondel\u0113z International and certain other sellers. On December 2, 2016, we acquired Victoria Fine Foods, LLC, and a related entity, from Huron Capital Partners and certain other sellers. On November 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the spices & seasonings business of ACH Food Companies, Inc. On November 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands from General Mills, Inc. And on July 10, 2015, we acquired Spartan Foods of America, Inc., and related entities, including the Mama Mary's brand, from Linsalata Capital Partners and certain other sellers. We refer to these acquisitions in this report as the Back to Nature acquisition,\u201d Victoria acquisition,\u201d spices & seasonings acquisition,\u201d Green Giant acquisition\u201d and Mama Mary's acquisition,\u201d respectively. Each of these recent acquisitions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions and the application of the acquisition method of accounting affect comparability between periods.\nWe are subject to a number of challenges that may adversely affect our businesses. These challenges, which are discussed above under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and below under the heading Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d include:\nFluctuations in Commodity Prices and Production and Distribution Costs. We purchase raw materials, including agricultural products, meat, poultry, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. Raw materials and other input costs, such as fuel and transportation, are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of raw materials, fuel, labor, distribution and other costs related to our operations can increase from time to time significantly and unexpectedly.\nWe attempt to manage cost inflation risks by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements and by implementing cost saving measures. We also attempt to offset rising input costs by raising sales prices to our customers. However, increases in the prices we charge our customers may lag behind rising input costs. Competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to rising costs.\n- 34 -\nWe expect to see moderate net cost increases for raw materials in the marketplace during 2018 and are currently locked into our supply and prices for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding, among others, maple syrup) through fiscal 2018 at a cost increase of less than 1% of cost of goods sold. During fiscal 2017, we had a minimal cost increase for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding, among others, maple syrup). To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs, implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if input costs begin to decline, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nConsolidation in the Retail Trade and Consequent Inventory Reductions. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. These customers are also reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products.\nChanging Consumer Preferences. Consumers in the market categories in which we compete frequently change their taste preferences, dietary habits and product packaging preferences.\nConsumer Concern Regarding Food Safety, Quality and Health. The food industry is subject to consumer concerns regarding the safety and quality of certain food products. If consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products, even as a result of a product liability claim or a product recall by a food industry competitor, our business could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates. Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada. Our sales to Canada are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and our sales for export to other countries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net sales to customers in foreign countries represented approximately 6.3%, 7.1% and 5.2%, respectively, of our total net sales. We also purchase a significant majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar could significantly increase our costs relating to the production of our maple syrup products to the extent we have not purchased Canadian dollars in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise entered into a currency hedging arrangement in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar. These increased costs would not be fully offset by the positive impact the change in the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have on our net sales in Canada. Our purchases of raw materials from other foreign suppliers are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. We also operate a manufacturing facility in Irapuato, Mexico for the manufacture of Green Giant frozen products and are as a result exposed to fluctuations in the Mexican peso. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses in Mexico are recognized in local foreign currency, and therefore we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our consolidated financial statements.\nTo confront these challenges, we continue to take steps to build the value of our brands, to improve our existing portfolio of products with new product and marketing initiatives, to reduce costs through improved productivity, to address consumer concerns about food safety, quality and health and to favorably manage currency fluctuations.\nCritical Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve trade and consumer promotion expenses; allowances for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and deferred tax assets; the determination of the useful life of customer relationship and amortizable trademark intangibles; the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; and the accounting for share-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.\n- 35 -\nOur significant accounting policies are described more fully in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nTrade and Consumer Promotion Expenses\nWe offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, in-store display incentives, slotting fees and coupons. The recognition of expense for these programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from our estimates.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.\nWe adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 applying the full retrospective transition approach to all contracts. Based on our comprehensive assessment of the new guidance, including our evaluation of the five-step approach outlined within the guidance, we concluded that the adoption will not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However, the adoption will result in a change in presentation of certain trade and consumer promotion expenses, specifically in-store display incentives also referred to as marketing development funds.\nWe previously recorded in-store display incentives or marketing development funds within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon the adoption of the new guidance, many of these cash payments will not meet the specific criteria within the new guidance of providing a distinct\u201d good or service, and therefore, will be required to be presented as a reduction of net sales. We currently anticipate that the impact of this change will result in a reduction of net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2018, the first year of adoption, with no impact to net income. See Note 2(s), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the expected adjustments to net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of the newly adopted revenue recognition standard.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out and average cost methods. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangibles with estimated useful lives are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted net future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating the fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur total assets include substantial goodwill and unamortizable intangible assets (trademarks). These assets are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or\n- 36 -\nunamortizable intangibles might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company's market capitalization with our company's carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization, we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value and recognizing a loss for the difference. As of December 30, 2017, we had $649.3 million of goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Our testing indicates that the implied fair value of goodwill is significantly in excess of the carrying value. Therefore, we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe test our unamortizable intangibles by comparing the fair value with the carrying value and recognize a loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of our unamortizable intangibles based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third party market value indicators. Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management, including future cash flows consistent with management's expectations, annual sales growth rates, and certain assumptions underlying a discount rate based on available market data. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate the future levels of sales and cash flows.\nAs of December 30, 2017, we had $1,483.6 million of unamortizable intangibles recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values, and the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value was 205.0% or more. The table below sets forth the book value as of December 30, 2017, of the trademarks of each of our brands whose fiscal 2017 net sales were equal to or exceeded 3% of our total fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands\u201d in the aggregate.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrand:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreen Giant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n422,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMrs. Dash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n189,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPirate Brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n152,800\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBear Creek Country Kitchens\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113,400\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpices & Seasonings(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrtega\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,339\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCream of Wheat\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaple Grove Farms of Vermont\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,627\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n470,235\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,483,601\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The spices & seasonings acquisition was completed on November 21, 2016. Includes trademark values for multiple brands acquired as part of the acquisition. \nAll assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for goodwill and unamortizable intangibles, such as forecasted growth rates and discount rate, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable, but they are inherently uncertain. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\nWe completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and unamortizable intangibles. However, materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses. For example, an interim impairment analysis relating to one of our brands performed during fiscal 2014, resulted in our company recording non cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles for the brand of $26.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, during fiscal 2014. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued that brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. Accordingly, we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles of $4.5 million and $0.9\n- 37 -\nmillion, respectively, which are recorded in Impairment of intangible assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016. In addition, any significant decline in our market capitalization, even if due to macroeconomic factors, could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or unamortizable intangible assets are impaired, although a non-cash charge to operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Tax Expense Estimates and Policies\nAs part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Further, to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period, we include such charge in our tax provision, or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.\nThere are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term, and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes to the U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements when new regulations and legislation are enacted. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not that such tax position will be sustained based upon its technical merits.\nSee U.S. Tax Act\u201d below for a discussion of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and the impact it has had and may have on our business and financial results.\nPension Expense\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 40% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the amount recommended by our actuaries. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates, employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality, and the rate of salary increases. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expenses and obligations. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During fiscal 2017, we made total contributions to our pension plans of $8.7 million. During fiscal 2016, we made total contributions to our pension plans of $3.5 million. Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nOur discount rate assumption for our four defined benefit plans changed from 4.039% at December 31, 2016 to 3.45%-3.56% at December 30, 2017. While we do not currently anticipate a change in our fiscal 2018 assumptions, as a sensitivity measure, a 0.25% decline or increase in our discount rate would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.5 million to $0.6 million. Similarly, a 0.25% decrease or increase in the expected return on pension plan assets would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.3 million. We expect to make $1.1 million of defined benefit pension plan contributions during fiscal 2018.\nAcquisition Accounting\nOur consolidated financial statements and results of operations include an acquired business's operations after the completion of the acquisition. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which\n- 38 -\nrequires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nWe provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options, performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs) and common stock to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period, if any.\nPerformance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e., the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company's performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.\nThe fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on both historical and implied volatilities of our common stock over the estimated expected term of the award. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, have a 10-year term and cliff vest three years from the date of grant.\nWe recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management, adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods.\nProduct Recall\nOn November 14, 2014, we announced a voluntary recall for certain Ortega and Las Palmas products after learning that one or more of the spice ingredients purchased from a third party supplier contained peanuts and almonds, allergens that are not declared on the products' ingredient statements. A significant majority of the costs of this recall were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. The cost impact of this recall during fiscal 2015 was $1.9 million, of which $1.2 million was recorded as a decrease in net sales related to customer refunds; $0.5 million was recorded as an increase in cost of goods sold primarily related to costs associated with product retrieval, destruction charges and customer fees; and $0.2 million was recorded as an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses related to administrative costs. In fiscal 2015, we received an insurance recovery of $5.0 million related to this recall.\n- 39 -\nU.S. Tax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we refer to as the U.S. Tax Act.\u201d The changes in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, we are required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change in tax rates. The U.S. Tax Act lowers the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we revalued our prior year U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, which resulted in a discrete tax benefit of approximately $133.3 million. This tax benefit was partially offset by an increase in our blended state rate of approximately $5.8 million and a repatriation expense of $0.9 million.\nThe reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% will be effective for our fiscal 2018. We estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 25%.\nWe also expect to realize a cash tax benefit for future bonus depreciation on certain business additions, which, together with the reduced income tax rate, we expect to reduce our cash income tax payments.\nThe U.S. Tax Act also limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a corporate taxpayer to 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income. While we do not currently expect that our interest expense will exceed 30% of our adjusted taxable income, in any event we do not believe this limitation will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results because any interest that is non-deductible may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance on December 23, 2017 providing a one-year measurement period from a registrant's reporting period that includes the U.S. Tax Act's enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain, prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under ASC 740. As of December 30, 2017, we have recorded all known and estimable impacts of the U.S. Tax Act that are effective for fiscal 2017. Future adjustments to the provisional numbers will be recorded as discrete adjustments to income tax expense in the period in which those adjustments become estimable and/or are finalized.\nThe ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2018 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Act different from that currently contemplated.\n- 40 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentages of net sales represented by selected items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.

Our net sales represents gross sales of products shipped to customers plus amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling, less cash discounts, coupon redemptions, slotting fees and trade promotional spending.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of goods sold. The primary components of our cost of goods sold are cost of internally manufactured products, purchases of finished goods from co-packers, a portion of our warehousing expenses plus freight costs to our distribution centers and to our customers.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to selling our products, as well as all other general and administrative expenses. Some of these costs include administrative, marketing and internal sales force employee compensation and benefits costs, consumer advertising programs, brokerage costs, a portion of our warehousing expenses, information technology and communication costs, office rent, utilities, supplies, professional services, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses and other general corporate expenses.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense includes the amortization expense associated with customer relationships, amortizable trademarks and other intangibles.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets represents a reduction of the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets to fair value when the carrying value of the assets is no longer recoverable.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense includes interest relating to our outstanding indebtedness, amortization of bond discount and amortization of deferred debt financing costs (net of interest income).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt includes costs relating to the retirement of indebtedness, including repurchase premium, if any, and write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount, if any.\nOther Income. Other income includes expense and/or income resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\n- 41 -\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain disclosures in this report include non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) in our consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows.\nBase Business Net Sales. Base business net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to measure operating performance. We define base business net sales as our net sales excluding (1) the impact of acquisitions until at least one full quarter of net sales from such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods and (2) net sales of discontinued brands. The portion of current period net sales attributable to recent acquisitions for which there is not at least one full quarter of net sales in the comparable period of the prior year is excluded. For each acquisition, the excluded period starts at the beginning of the most recent fiscal period being compared and ends on the last day of the quarter in which the first anniversary of the date of acquisition occurs, and the period from the date of acquisition to the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred. For discontinued brands, the entire amount of net sales is excluded from each fiscal period being compared. Management has included this financial measure because it provides useful and comparable trend information regarding the results of our business without the effect of the timing of acquisitions and the effect of discontinued brands.\nThe definition of base business net sales set forth above, as it relates to acquisitions, has been modified from the definition we have used in prior annual reports. Under our previous definition of base business net sales, for each acquisition, the excluded period started at the beginning of the most recent fiscal period being compared and ended on the first anniversary of the acquisition date. We believe that it is more useful to measure base business net sales on a full quarter basis and accordingly have updated the fiscal 2016 versus 2015 base business net sales presentation below to reflect this change.\nA reconciliation of base business net sales to reported net sales for fiscal 2017 and 2016 follows (in thousands):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReported net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,668,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,391,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales from acquisitions(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(323,794)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31,437)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales of Rickland Orchards(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(528)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBase business net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,344,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,359,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Reflects all net sales for Victoria and the spices & seasonings business for each period presented and net sales for Back to Nature for fiscal 2017.

Rickland Orchards was discontinued during the second quarter of 2016. \n- 42 -\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses, integration, restructuring and consolidation expenses and amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up, gains and losses on the sale of assets) and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; loss on product recalls, including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs, loss on product recalls and distribution restructuring expenses because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However, management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income, net income (loss) or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity's ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity's profitability because they do not include costs and expenses for depreciation and amortization, interest and related expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses, income taxes, intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs, gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs, loss on product recalls and distribution restructuring expenses. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP amounts.\n- 43 -\nA reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 along with the

Non-recurring adjustment to deferred income taxes for fiscal 2016 relates to a true-up of deferred income taxes resulting from our decision during the second quarter of 2016 to discontinue the Rickland Orchards brand and the related impairment of intangible assets. Non-recurring adjustment to deferred income taxes for fiscal 2015 relates to a true-up of deferred taxes for state apportionment as a result of the Green Giant and Mama Mary's acquisitions. \n (2) Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2017 includes the tax impact of the change in our effective tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $0.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and less than $0.1 million relating to the refinancing of our tranche B term loans. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amounts of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. \n (3) Acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses for fiscal 2017 primarily include acquisition and integration expenses for the Green Giant, spices & seasonings, Victoria and Back to Nature acquisitions, severance and hiring costs, a non-recurring interest charge relating to the refinancing of our credit agreement and a non-recurring startup surcharge paid to a co-packer. \n (4) Distribution restructuring expenses for fiscal 2016 and 2015 include expenses relating to our transitioning of the operations of our three primary shelf-stable distribution centers and a new fourth primary shelf-stable distribution center in the United States to a third party logistics provider. \n (5) Acquisition-related inventory step-up for fiscal 2017 relates to the purchase accounting adjustments made to the finished goods inventory acquired in the Back to Nature and spices & seasonings acquisitions. Acquisition-related inventory step-up for fiscal 2016 relates to the purchase accounting adjustments made to the finished goods inventory acquired in the spices & seasonings acquisition. Acquisition-related step-up for fiscal 2015 relates to the purchase accounting adjustments made to the finished goods inventory acquired in the Green Giant acquisition. \n (6) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a loss on disposal of inventory of $3.3 million. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. Accordingly, we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles of $4.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which are recorded in Impairment of intangible assets\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016. We also recorded a charge to cost of goods sold of approximately $0.8 million in connection with the write-off of raw materials and finished goods inventory used for the Rickland Orchards brand. \n (7) During fiscal 2017, we sold to a third-party co-packer our Le Sueur, Minnesota research center, including the seed technology assets, property, plant and equipment. We acquired the research center and related assets on November 2, 2015, as part of the Green Giant acquisition. The sale resulted in a $1.6 million loss on sale of assets. \nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $276.8 million, or approximately 20.0%, to $1.67 billion for fiscal 2017 from $1.39 billion in 2016. The net sales increase was due to an increase in unit volume of $287.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in net pricing of $10.7 million. The unit volume increase was primarily driven by an additional eleven plus months of net sales of the spices & seasonings business, acquired on November 21, 2016, an additional eleven months of net sales of Victoria, acquired on December 2, 2016, and three months of net sales of Back to Nature, acquired on October 2, 2017.\n- 45 -\nBase business net sales for fiscal 2017 decreased by approximately $15.0 million, or 1.1%. The decrease in base business net sales was driven by a decrease in unit volume of $4.3 million, or 0.3%, and a decrease in net pricing of $10.7 million, or 0.8%. Net sales of Green Giant frozen products, benefitting from the strong performance of new innovation products, increased $33.6 million, or 11.1%, and net sales of Pirate Brands, benefitting from new distribution gains, plus momentum from a strong back-to-school season and successful promotional events, increased $5.2 million, or 6.1%. Net sales of Green Giant shelf-stable products decreased $30.6 million, or 19.6%, primarily due to weak consumption trends and distribution losses with a key customer. Net sales of our maple syrup products decreased $7.0 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to the Company's decision during the first quarter of 2017 to discontinue certain private label sales. And net sales of Ortega decreased $3.0 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to heightened competitive activity. The overall decline in base business net sales in fiscal 2017 was concentrated in the first half of the year. Base business net sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 increased 1.2% compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016.\nThe spices & seasonings business and Victoria, each acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016, generated fiscal 2017 net sales of $260.7 million and $42.8 million, respectively, compared to our initial forecasts at the time of acquisition of $220.0 million of net sales for the spices & seasonings business and $41.0 million of net sales for Victoria.\nSee Note 15, Net Sales by Brand,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for detailed information regarding total net sales by brand for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 for each of our brands that equaled or exceeded approximately 3% of our fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands in the aggregate.\nThe following chart sets forth the most significant base business net sales increases and decreases by brand for fiscal 2017:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBase Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrand:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreen Giant - frozen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPirate Brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew York Style\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnderwood\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGrandma's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreen Giant - shelf stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(30.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaple Grove Farms of Vermont\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrtega\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMama Mary's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBear Creek Country Kitchens\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLas Palmas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpring Tree\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nB&M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBloch & Guggenheimer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrueNorth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmeril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBase business net sales decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $14.3 million, or 3.2%, to $462.2 million for fiscal 2017 from $448.0 million for fiscal 2016. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales was 27.7% for fiscal 2017 compared to 32.2% for fiscal 2016. Excluding the 2.5 percentage point impact due to product mix, gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.0 percentage points. Approximately 1.4 percentage points of the decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in warehousing and distribution costs and 0.6 percentage points of the decrease was due to a decrease in net pricing.\n- 46 -\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $205.2 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $30.5 million, or 17.4%. The increase was attributable to increased warehousing expenses of $12.8 million, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses of $11.4 million, selling expenses of $7.2 million (which includes increases on brokerage expenses of $5.9 million and $0.6 million of salesperson compensation) and consumer marketing expenses of $0.6 million, slightly offset by decreases of $1.3 million of distribution restructuring expenses and all other expenses of $0.2 million. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 0.3 percentage points to 12.3% for fiscal 2017 compared to 12.5% for 2016.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense increased $3.8 million to $17.6 million for fiscal 2017 from $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 due to the Back to Nature acquisition completed in fiscal 2017 and the spices & seasonings and Victoria acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets of $5.4 million for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards, as we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand during the second quarter of 2016 because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production.\nOperating Income. As a result of the foregoing, operating income decreased $14.6 million, or 5.7%, to $239.4 million for fiscal 2017 from $254.0 million for fiscal 2016. Operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.4% in fiscal 2017 from 18.3% in fiscal 2016.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense was $91.8 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $74.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to additional borrowings made in the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund the spices & seasonings acquisition and the Victoria acquisition and in the fourth quarter of 2017 to fund the Back to Nature acquisition, and our senior notes offerings in second quarter and fourth quarter of 2017. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt\u201d below.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2017 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $0.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. See Liquidity and Capital Resources -Debt\u201d below.\nOther Income. Other income for fiscal 2017 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.6 million. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense. Income tax (benefit) expense changed $137.0 million to a tax benefit of $(69.4) million in fiscal 2017 from a tax expense of $67.6 million for fiscal 2016. See U.S. Tax Act\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the recently enacted tax legislation on Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Without the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, our income tax expense for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately $57.1 million and our effective tax rate would have been 38.6%.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $424.9 million, or 44.0%, to $1,391.3 million for fiscal 2016 from $966.4 million for fiscal 2015. An additional ten months of net sales of Green Giant, acquired on November 2, 2015, and an additional almost six months of net sales of Mama Mary's, acquired on July 10, 2015, contributed $397.6 million and $19.4 million, respectively, to the overall net sales increase. In addition, net sales of the spices & seasonings business, acquired on November 21, 2016, and net sales of Victoria, acquired on December 2, 2016, contributed $28.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, to the overall net sales increase.\n- 47 -\nBase business net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $20.9 million, or 2.5%, to $816.8 million from $837.7 million for fiscal 2015. The $20.9 million decrease was attributable to a decrease in unit volume of $14.2 million, or 1.7%, a decrease in net pricing of $6.0 million, or 0.7%, and the negative impact of currency fluctuations on foreign sales of approximately $0.7 million, or 0.1%.\nA primary driver of the decline in base business net sales for fiscal 2016 was our syrup business. The net sales of those brands declined in the aggregate $7.7 million for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to maple syrup price deflation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, which resulted in increased competition in the maple syrup category and contractually mandated price reductions with certain of our foodservice customers. Another significant factor in the decline in base business net sales for fiscal 2016 was the TrueNorth brand, which declined $6.4 million, or 33.9%. The TrueNorth net sales decline was primarily the result of historically high almond prices in 2015. In response to increased almond costs, we increased the selling price for TrueNorth products, which had a negative impact on consumer demand. Although we rolled back pricing as almond prices began to return to historical norms, consumer demand did not return to prior levels. Base business net sales were also negatively impacted by net sales of our Ortega products, which decreased $3.7 million, or 2.6%. A portion of the decrease was attributable to the effects of the product recall we announced in November 2014, which caused an increase in net sales of Ortega in fiscal 2015 due to customers restocking inventory of products affected by the recall, partially offset by $1.2 million of customer refunds related to the recall. $1.5 million of the decrease in net sales of Ortega was due to a net pricing decrease in fiscal 2016.\nSee Note 15, Net Sales by Brand,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for detailed information regarding total net sales by brand for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 for each of our brands that equaled or exceeded approximately 3% of our fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands in the aggregate.\nThe following chart sets forth the most significant base business net sales increases and decreases by brand for fiscal 2016:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBase Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrand:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPirate Brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLas Palmas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrueNorth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(33.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaple Grove Farms of Vermont\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrtega\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMrs. Dash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpring Tree\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew York Style\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other brands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBase business net sales decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(20.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $158.4 million, or 54.7%, to $448.0 million for fiscal 2016 from $289.6 million for fiscal 2015. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.2% in fiscal 2016 from 30.0% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 2.2 percentage points. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by the acquisition of Green Giant. Gross profit percentage was also positively impacted by decreased costs for commodities, packaging and distribution for the base business and improved product mix, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact the decrease in base business sales volume had on cost absorption, a net reduction in base business pricing, and the impact of the write-off of Rickland Orchards inventory in connection with our decision to discontinue the brand. See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of this write-off.\n- 48 -\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $68.9 million, or 65.0%, to $174.8 million for fiscal 2016 from $105.9 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to the Green Giant acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses and distribution restructuring expenses increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2016. The remaining $58.9 million of the increase was attributable to increases in consumer marketing of $41.6 million, selling expenses of $8.7 million (which includes a $7.5 million increase in brokerage expenses and a $1.2 million increase in salesperson compensation), warehousing expenses of $7.4 million and general and administrative expenses of $1.2 million (primarily related to compensation). Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.5 percentage points to 12.5% for fiscal 2016 from 11.0% for fiscal 2015.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense increased $2.5 million to $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 from $11.3 million for fiscal 2015 due to the Victoria and spices & seasonings acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and the Green Giant and Mama Mary's acquisitions completed in fiscal 2015.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets of $5.4 million for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards, as we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the impairment of intangible assets related to Rickland Orchards.\nOperating Income. As a result of the foregoing, operating income increased $81.6 million, or 47.4%, to $254.0 million for fiscal 2016 from $172.4 million for fiscal 2015. Operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.3% in fiscal 2016 from 17.8% in fiscal 2015.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense increased $23.4 million, or 45.6%, to $74.5 million for fiscal 2016 from $51.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional indebtedness outstanding during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of the Green Giant acquisition, the spices & seasonings acquisition, and the Victoria acquisition. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\u201d below.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. We did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2015. See -Debt\u201d below.\nOther Income. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased $15.5 million to $67.6 million for fiscal 2016 from $52.1 million for fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for fiscal 2016 and 43.0% for fiscal 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity requirements include debt service, capital expenditures and working capital needs. See also, Dividend Policy\u201d and Commitments and Contractual Obligations\u201d below. We fund our liquidity requirements, as well as our dividend payments and financing for acquisitions, primarily through cash generated from operations and external sources of financing, including our revolving credit facility.\nCash Flows\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $251.9 million to $37.8 million for fiscal 2017 from $289.7 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects unfavorable working capital (comprised of changes in inventories, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses) comparisons to the fiscal year 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a\n- 49 -\nsignificant increase in inventory net of businesses acquired in 2017 compared to a decrease in inventory net of businesses acquired in 2016, and the timing of payments received from post-acquisition transition services agreements. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $161.2 million to $289.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $128.5 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the Green Giant acquisition, including the favorable impact of an increase in cash provided by working capital and higher net income for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $260.7 million to $220.5 million for fiscal 2017 from $481.2 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in payments made for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, and an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by an increase in capital spending. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 included expenditures for building improvements, purchases of manufacturing equipment, expenditures in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and capitalized interest.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 increased $143.3 million to $359.3 million from $216.0 million for fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year 2017 consisted of $914.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of our 5.25% senior notes and $395.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings, partially offset by $233.6 million repayment of our tranche A term loans, $571.0 million of repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings, $123.6 million of dividend payments, $19.5 million of debt financing costs and $2.0 million of payments of tax withholding on behalf of employees for net share settlement of share based compensation. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2016 decreased $551.4 million to $216.0 million from $767.4 million for fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to differences in the net effects of our equity offerings in March and August of 2016, prepayments of long-term debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. See -Debt\u201d below.\nCash Income Tax Payments. During fiscal 2017 we made cash tax payments of approximately $17.2 million even though we recorded a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes. See U.S. Tax Act\u201d above for a discussion of the impact and expected impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our cash income tax payments. Based on a number of factors, including amortization for tax purposes of our trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions, we realized a significant reduction in cash taxes in fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared to our tax expense for financial reporting purposes. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand, which resulted in a one-time cash taxes benefit of $17.3 million for fiscal 2016. We believe that we will realize a benefit to our cash taxes payable from amortization of our trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets for the taxable years 2018 through 2032. If there is a change in U.S. federal tax policy that reduces any of these available deductions or results in an increase in our corporate tax rate, our cash taxes payable may increase further, which could significantly reduce our future liquidity and impact our ability to make interest and dividend payments.\nDividend Policy\nFor a discussion of our dividend policy, see the information set forth under the heading Dividend Policy\u201d in Part II, Item 5 of this report.\nAcquisitions\nOur liquidity and capital resources have been significantly impacted by acquisitions and may be impacted in the foreseeable future by additional acquisitions. As discussed elsewhere in this report, as part of our growth strategy we plan to expand our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary brands. We have historically financed acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness, issuing equity and/or using cash flows from operating activities. Our interest expense has over time increased as a result of additional indebtedness we have incurred in connection with acquisitions and will increase with any additional indebtedness we may incur to finance future acquisitions. Although we may subsequently issue equity and use the proceeds to repay all or a portion of the additional indebtedness incurred to finance an acquisition and reduce our interest expense, the additional shares of common stock would increase the amount of cash flows from operating activities necessary to fund dividend payments.\n- 50 -\nWe financed the Mama Mary's acquisition, completed in July 2015, with cash on hand from the proceeds of a public offering of common stock we completed in May 2015. We financed the Green Giant acquisition, completed in November 2015, with additional indebtedness, and we repaid a portion of that additional indebtedness with the proceeds of a public offering of common stock we completed in March 2016. We financed the spices & seasonings acquisition, completed in November 2016, with cash on hand, including the net proceeds of our August 2016 public offering of common stock, and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. We financed the Victoria acquisition, completed in December 2016, with cash on hand and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. We financed the Back to Nature acquisition, completed in October 2017, with cash on hand and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. The impact of future acquisitions, whether financed with additional indebtedness or otherwise, may have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Agreement. In fiscal 2017, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility twice by amending and restating our senior secured credit agreement, first on March 30, 2017, and again on November 20, 2017.\nThe first refinancing, on March 30, 2017, reduced by 0.75% the spread over LIBOR or the applicable base rate on $640.1 million of tranche B term loans.\nOn April 3, 2017, we repaid all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans using a portion of the net proceeds of our registered public offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025.\nOn November 20, 2017, we again refinanced our senior secured credit facility. This second refinancing increased the principal amount of the tranche B term loans by $10 million to $650.1 million, reduced by 25 basis points the spread over LIBOR or the applicable base rate on the tranche B term loans and any revolving loans, increased the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $700 million, and extended the maturity date applicable to our revolving credit facility from June 2019 to November 2022.\nAt December 30, 2017, $650.1 million of tranche B term loans and no amount of revolving loans were outstanding under our credit agreement. During the first quarter of 2018, we made an optional prepayment of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. As of the date of this report, $600.1 million of tranche B term loans remains outstanding.\nOur credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries' assets except our and our domestic subsidiaries' real property.\nAt December 30, 2017, the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $2.2 million, was $697.8 million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar line of business as our company, subject to specified criteria. The revolving credit facility matures on November 21, 2022.\nThe entire $600.1 million principal amount of tranche B term loans outstanding are due and payable at maturity on November 2, 2022.\nInterest under the revolving credit facility, including any outstanding letters of credit is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, and LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, in each case depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.\nInterest under the tranche B term loan facility is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin of 1.00%, and LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. At December 30, 2017, the tranche B term loan interest rate was approximately 3.569%.\nFor further information regarding our credit agreement, including a description of optional and mandatory prepayment terms, and financial and restrictive covenants, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n- 51 -\n4.625% Senior Notes due 2021. On June 4, 2013, we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% senior notes to purchase or redeem all $248.5 million principal amount of our then existing 7.625% senior notes due 2018, to repay $222.2 million principal amount of our then existing tranche B term loans and approximately $40.0 million principal amount of revolving loans under our then existing credit agreement, and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses. We used the remaining net proceeds for our acquisition of Pirate Brands, completed in July 2013.\nInterest on the 4.625% senior notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.625% senior notes will mature on June 1, 2021, unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 4.625% senior notes as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 4.625% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 4.625% senior notes or exchanges of the 4.625% senior notes for equity securities or both, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 4.625% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 4.625% senior notes and/or exchanges of the 4.625% senior notes for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a more detailed description of the 4.625% senior notes.\n5.25% Senior Notes due 2025. On April 3, 2017, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. On November 20, 2017, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public 101% of their face value plus accrued interest from October 1, 2017, which equates to a yield to worst of 5.03%. The notes issued in November were issued as additional notes under the same indenture as our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 that were issued in April, and, as such, form a single series and trade interchangeably with the previously issued 5.25% senior notes.\nWe used the net proceeds of the April offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans, and to pay related fees and expenses. We used the net proceeds of the November offering to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We have used a portion of, and intend to use the remaining portion of, the net proceeds of the April and November offerings for general corporate purposes, which have included and could include, among other things, repayment of other long term debt or possible acquisitions.\nInterest on the 5.25% senior notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2017. The 5.25% senior notes will mature on April 1, 2025, unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% senior notes as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 5.25% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 5.25% senior notes and/or exchanges of the 5.25% senior notes for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a more detailed description of the 5.25% senior notes.\nDeferred Debt Financing Costs. During fiscal 2017, we wrote off and expensed $0.9 million of debt financing costs in connection with the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and less than $0.1 million in connection with the refinancing of our tranche B term loans. During fiscal 2016, we wrote-off and expensed $2.2 million of debt financing costs in connection with the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. During fiscal 2015, we\n- 52 -\ncapitalized $14.5 million of debt financing costs relating to the tranche B term loans, which are being amortized over the seven year scheduled term of the tranche B term loans.\nFuture Capital Needs\nOn December 30, 2017, our total long-term debt of $2,217.6 million, net of our cash and cash equivalents of $206.5 million, was $2,011.1 million. Stockholders' equity as of that date was $880.8 million.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations depends generally on our results of operations and the availability of financing. Our management believes that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow from operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund operations, meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, if any, and pay our anticipated quarterly dividends on our common stock.\nWe expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2018. Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 include anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 million to move equipment used in the production of certain Green Giant products from General Mills' Belvidere, Illinois manufacturing facility to an existing B&G Foods co-packer, approximately $2.0 million for new productivity projects, $5.5 million to fund infrastructure optimization projects, $3.6 million for IT infrastructure including cyber security, and approximately $12.4 million in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nSeasonality\nSales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or certain other annual events. In general our sales are higher during the first and fourth quarters.\nWe purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable vegetables, shelf-stable pickles, relishes, peppers, tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October, and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently, our liquidity needs are greatest during these periods.\nInflation\nWe are currently locked into pricing and supply for substantially all of our major commodities, other than maple syrup, through fiscal 2018 at a cost increase of less than 1% of cost of goods sold and will continue to manage inflation risk by entering into short term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements from time to time, and, if necessary, by raising prices. During each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we had a minimal cost decrease. To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs, implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if input costs begin to decline, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nContingencies\nSee Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2(s), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n- 53 -\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 30, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations and commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness, future minimum operating lease obligations, future purchase obligations and future pension obligations as set forth in the following table as of December 30, 2017.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt-principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,250,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,350,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n900,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt-interest(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n532,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n186,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n137,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n106,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,865,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n152,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n204,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,495,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,013,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Expected interest payments on long-term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding, scheduled maturity dates and interest rates at December 30, 2017. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for further information as to our long-term debt interest obligations. \n (2) For the purposes of this table, purchase obligations means agreements to purchase goods or services (such as raw materials, commodities, packaging, other materials and supplies and co-manufacturing arrangements) that are enforceable and legally binding on B&G Foods and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations in the above table do not represent our entire expected future purchases for goods and services, which are significantly higher than the amounts set forth above. The table does not include purchase obligations under contracts that may be cancelled by B&G Foods without material penalty. Any amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the purchase obligations set forth in the table above. Penalties, if any, related to molds and equipment based upon failure to meet minimum volume requirements are also excluded from the table because we are unable to determine whether such penalties will be incurred and, if incurred, over what time period they will be paid. \n (3) We expect to make $1.1 million of defined pension benefit contributions during fiscal 2018. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of pension contributions and contribution amounts beyond fiscal 2018. \nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements, including without limitation the statements under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d estimates,\u201d projects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements\u201d below and elsewhere in this report. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nGeneral\nWe manufacture, sell and distribute a diverse portfolio of branded, high quality, shelf-stable and frozen foods and household products, many of which have leading regional or national market shares. In general, we position our branded products to appeal to the consumer desiring a high quality and reasonably priced product. We complement our branded product retail sales with institutional and foodservice sales and private label sales.\nOur company has been built upon a successful track record of acquisition-driven growth. Our goal is to continue to increase sales, profitability and cash flows through strategic acquisitions, new product development and organic growth. We intend to implement our growth strategy through the following initiatives: expanding our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary branded businesses, continuing to develop new products and delivering them to market quickly, leveraging our multiple channel sales and distribution system and continuing to focus on higher growth customers and distribution channels.\nSince 1996, we have successfully acquired and integrated more than 45 brands into our company. Most recently, on October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Back to Nature Foods Company, LLC and related entities from Brynwood Partners VI L.P., Mondel\u0113z International and certain other sellers. On December 2, 2016, we acquired Victoria Fine Foods, LLC, and a related entity, from Huron Capital Partners and certain other sellers. On November 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the spices & seasonings business of ACH Food Companies, Inc. On November 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands from General Mills, Inc. And on July 10, 2015, we acquired Spartan Foods of America, Inc., and related entities, including the Mama Mary's brand, from Linsalata Capital Partners and certain other sellers. We refer to these acquisitions in this report as the Back to Nature acquisition,\u201d Victoria acquisition,\u201d spices & seasonings acquisition,\u201d Green Giant acquisition\u201d and Mama Mary's acquisition,\u201d respectively. Each of these recent acquisitions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions and the application of the acquisition method of accounting affect comparability between periods.\nWe are subject to a number of challenges that may adversely affect our businesses. These challenges, which are discussed above under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and below under the heading Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d include:\nFluctuations in Commodity Prices and Production and Distribution Costs. We purchase raw materials, including agricultural products, meat, poultry, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. Raw materials and other input costs, such as fuel and transportation, are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of raw materials, fuel, labor, distribution and other costs related to our operations can increase from time to time significantly and unexpectedly.\nWe attempt to manage cost inflation risks by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements and by implementing cost saving measures. We also attempt to offset rising input costs by raising sales prices to our customers. However, increases in the prices we charge our customers may lag behind rising input costs. Competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to rising costs.\n- 34 -\nWe expect to see moderate net cost increases for raw materials in the marketplace during 2018 and are currently locked into our supply and prices for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding, among others, maple syrup) through fiscal 2018 at a cost increase of less than 1% of cost of goods sold. During fiscal 2017, we had a minimal cost increase for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding, among others, maple syrup). To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs, implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if input costs begin to decline, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nConsolidation in the Retail Trade and Consequent Inventory Reductions. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. These customers are also reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products.\nChanging Consumer Preferences. Consumers in the market categories in which we compete frequently change their taste preferences, dietary habits and product packaging preferences.\nConsumer Concern Regarding Food Safety, Quality and Health. The food industry is subject to consumer concerns regarding the safety and quality of certain food products. If consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products, even as a result of a product liability claim or a product recall by a food industry competitor, our business could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates. Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada. Our sales to Canada are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and our sales for export to other countries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net sales to customers in foreign countries represented approximately 6.3%, 7.1% and 5.2%, respectively, of our total net sales. We also purchase a significant majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar could significantly increase our costs relating to the production of our maple syrup products to the extent we have not purchased Canadian dollars in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise entered into a currency hedging arrangement in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar. These increased costs would not be fully offset by the positive impact the change in the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have on our net sales in Canada. Our purchases of raw materials from other foreign suppliers are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. We also operate a manufacturing facility in Irapuato, Mexico for the manufacture of Green Giant frozen products and are as a result exposed to fluctuations in the Mexican peso. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses in Mexico are recognized in local foreign currency, and therefore we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our consolidated financial statements.\nTo confront these challenges, we continue to take steps to build the value of our brands, to improve our existing portfolio of products with new product and marketing initiatives, to reduce costs through improved productivity, to address consumer concerns about food safety, quality and health and to favorably manage currency fluctuations.\nCritical Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve trade and consumer promotion expenses; allowances for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and deferred tax assets; the determination of the useful life of customer relationship and amortizable trademark intangibles; the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; and the accounting for share-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.\n- 35 -\nOur significant accounting policies are described more fully in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nTrade and Consumer Promotion Expenses\nWe offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, in-store display incentives, slotting fees and coupons. The recognition of expense for these programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from our estimates.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.\nWe adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 applying the full retrospective transition approach to all contracts. Based on our comprehensive assessment of the new guidance, including our evaluation of the five-step approach outlined within the guidance, we concluded that the adoption will not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However, the adoption will result in a change in presentation of certain trade and consumer promotion expenses, specifically in-store display incentives also referred to as marketing development funds.\nWe previously recorded in-store display incentives or marketing development funds within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon the adoption of the new guidance, many of these cash payments will not meet the specific criteria within the new guidance of providing a distinct\u201d good or service, and therefore, will be required to be presented as a reduction of net sales. We currently anticipate that the impact of this change will result in a reduction of net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2018, the first year of adoption, with no impact to net income. See Note 2(s), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the expected adjustments to net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of the newly adopted revenue recognition standard.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out and average cost methods. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangibles with estimated useful lives are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted net future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating the fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur total assets include substantial goodwill and unamortizable intangible assets (trademarks). These assets are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or\n- 36 -\nunamortizable intangibles might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company's market capitalization with our company's carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization, we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value and recognizing a loss for the difference. As of December 30, 2017, we had $649.3 million of goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Our testing indicates that the implied fair value of goodwill is significantly in excess of the carrying value. Therefore, we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe test our unamortizable intangibles by comparing the fair value with the carrying value and recognize a loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of our unamortizable intangibles based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third party market value indicators. Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management, including future cash flows consistent with management's expectations, annual sales growth rates, and certain assumptions underlying a discount rate based on available market data. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate the future levels of sales and cash flows.\nAs of December 30, 2017, we had $1,483.6 million of unamortizable intangibles recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values, and the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value was 205.0% or more. The table below sets forth the book value as of December 30, 2017, of the trademarks of each of our brands whose fiscal 2017 net sales were equal to or exceeded 3% of our total fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands\u201d in the aggregate.\n\n (1) The spices & seasonings acquisition was completed on November 21, 2016. Includes trademark values for multiple brands acquired as part of the acquisition. \nAll assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for goodwill and unamortizable intangibles, such as forecasted growth rates and discount rate, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable, but they are inherently uncertain. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\nWe completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and unamortizable intangibles. However, materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses. For example, an interim impairment analysis relating to one of our brands performed during fiscal 2014, resulted in our company recording non cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles for the brand of $26.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, during fiscal 2014. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued that brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. Accordingly, we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles of $4.5 million and $0.9\n- 37 -\nmillion, respectively, which are recorded in Impairment of intangible assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016. In addition, any significant decline in our market capitalization, even if due to macroeconomic factors, could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or unamortizable intangible assets are impaired, although a non-cash charge to operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Tax Expense Estimates and Policies\nAs part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Further, to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period, we include such charge in our tax provision, or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.\nThere are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term, and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes to the U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements when new regulations and legislation are enacted. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not that such tax position will be sustained based upon its technical merits.\nSee U.S. Tax Act\u201d below for a discussion of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and the impact it has had and may have on our business and financial results.\nPension Expense\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 40% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the amount recommended by our actuaries. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates, employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality, and the rate of salary increases. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expenses and obligations. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During fiscal 2017, we made total contributions to our pension plans of $8.7 million. During fiscal 2016, we made total contributions to our pension plans of $3.5 million. Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nOur discount rate assumption for our four defined benefit plans changed from 4.039% at December 31, 2016 to 3.45%-3.56% at December 30, 2017. While we do not currently anticipate a change in our fiscal 2018 assumptions, as a sensitivity measure, a 0.25% decline or increase in our discount rate would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.5 million to $0.6 million. Similarly, a 0.25% decrease or increase in the expected return on pension plan assets would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.3 million. We expect to make $1.1 million of defined benefit pension plan contributions during fiscal 2018.\nAcquisition Accounting\nOur consolidated financial statements and results of operations include an acquired business's operations after the completion of the acquisition. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which\n- 38 -\nrequires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nWe provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options, performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs) and common stock to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period, if any.\nPerformance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e., the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company's performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.\nThe fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on both historical and implied volatilities of our common stock over the estimated expected term of the award. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, have a 10-year term and cliff vest three years from the date of grant.\nWe recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management, adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods.\nProduct Recall\nOn November 14, 2014, we announced a voluntary recall for certain Ortega and Las Palmas products after learning that one or more of the spice ingredients purchased from a third party supplier contained peanuts and almonds, allergens that are not declared on the products' ingredient statements. A significant majority of the costs of this recall were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. The cost impact of this recall during fiscal 2015 was $1.9 million, of which $1.2 million was recorded as a decrease in net sales related to customer refunds; $0.5 million was recorded as an increase in cost of goods sold primarily related to costs associated with product retrieval, destruction charges and customer fees; and $0.2 million was recorded as an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses related to administrative costs. In fiscal 2015, we received an insurance recovery of $5.0 million related to this recall.\n- 39 -\nU.S. Tax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we refer to as the U.S. Tax Act.\u201d The changes in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, we are required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change in tax rates. The U.S. Tax Act lowers the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we revalued our prior year U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, which resulted in a discrete tax benefit of approximately $133.3 million. This tax benefit was partially offset by an increase in our blended state rate of approximately $5.8 million and a repatriation expense of $0.9 million.\nThe reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% will be effective for our fiscal 2018. We estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 25%.\nWe also expect to realize a cash tax benefit for future bonus depreciation on certain business additions, which, together with the reduced income tax rate, we expect to reduce our cash income tax payments.\nThe U.S. Tax Act also limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a corporate taxpayer to 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income. While we do not currently expect that our interest expense will exceed 30% of our adjusted taxable income, in any event we do not believe this limitation will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results because any interest that is non-deductible may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance on December 23, 2017 providing a one-year measurement period from a registrant's reporting period that includes the U.S. Tax Act's enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain, prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under ASC 740. As of December 30, 2017, we have recorded all known and estimable impacts of the U.S. Tax Act that are effective for fiscal 2017. Future adjustments to the provisional numbers will be recorded as discrete adjustments to income tax expense in the period in which those adjustments become estimable and/or are finalized.\nThe ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2018 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Act different from that currently contemplated.\n- 40 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentages of net sales represented by selected items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. The comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results:\n\nAs used in this section the terms listed below have the following meanings:\nNet Sales. Our net sales represents gross sales of products shipped to customers plus amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling, less cash discounts, coupon redemptions, slotting fees and trade promotional spending.\nGross Profit. Our gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of goods sold. The primary components of our cost of goods sold are cost of internally manufactured products, purchases of finished goods from co-packers, a portion of our warehousing expenses plus freight costs to our distribution centers and to our customers.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to selling our products, as well as all other general and administrative expenses. Some of these costs include administrative, marketing and internal sales force employee compensation and benefits costs, consumer advertising programs, brokerage costs, a portion of our warehousing expenses, information technology and communication costs, office rent, utilities, supplies, professional services, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses and other general corporate expenses.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense includes the amortization expense associated with customer relationships, amortizable trademarks and other intangibles.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets represents a reduction of the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets to fair value when the carrying value of the assets is no longer recoverable.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense includes interest relating to our outstanding indebtedness, amortization of bond discount and amortization of deferred debt financing costs (net of interest income).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt includes costs relating to the retirement of indebtedness, including repurchase premium, if any, and write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount, if any.\nOther Income. Other income includes expense and/or income resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\n- 41 -\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain disclosures in this report include non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) in our consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows.\nBase Business Net Sales. Base business net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to measure operating performance. We define base business net sales as our net sales excluding (1) the impact of acquisitions until at least one full quarter of net sales from such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods and (2) net sales of discontinued brands. The portion of current period net sales attributable to recent acquisitions for which there is not at least one full quarter of net sales in the comparable period of the prior year is excluded. For each acquisition, the excluded period starts at the beginning of the most recent fiscal period being compared and ends on the last day of the quarter in which the first anniversary of the date of acquisition occurs, and the period from the date of acquisition to the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred. For discontinued brands, the entire amount of net sales is excluded from each fiscal period being compared. Management has included this financial measure because it provides useful and comparable trend information regarding the results of our business without the effect of the timing of acquisitions and the effect of discontinued brands.\nThe definition of base business net sales set forth above, as it relates to acquisitions, has been modified from the definition we have used in prior annual reports. Under our previous definition of base business net sales, for each acquisition, the excluded period started at the beginning of the most recent fiscal period being compared and ended on the first anniversary of the acquisition date. We believe that it is more useful to measure base business net sales on a full quarter basis and accordingly have updated the fiscal 2016 versus 2015 base business net sales presentation below to reflect this change.\nA reconciliation of base business net sales to reported net sales for fiscal 2017 and 2016 follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Reflects all net sales for Victoria and the spices & seasonings business for each period presented and net sales for Back to Nature for fiscal 2017. Back to Nature was acquired on October 2, 2017, Victoria was acquired on December 2, 2016, and the spices & seasonings business was acquired on November 21, 2016. \n (2) Reflects all net sales of Rickland Orchards for each period presented. Rickland Orchards was discontinued during the second quarter of 2016. \nA reconciliation of base business net sales to reported net sales for fiscal 2016 and 2015 follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes all net sales for Victoria, the spices & seasonings business and Green Giant. Also includes all net sales of Mama Mary's for the third quarter of 2016. Victoria was acquired on December 2, 2016, the spices & seasonings business was acquired on November 21, 2016, Green Giant was acquired on November 2, 2015, and Mama Mary's was acquired on July 10, 2015. \n (2) Reflects all net sales of Rickland Orchards for each period presented. Rickland Orchards was discontinued during the second quarter of 2016. \n- 42 -\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses, integration, restructuring and consolidation expenses and amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up, gains and losses on the sale of assets) and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; loss on product recalls, including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs, loss on product recalls and distribution restructuring expenses because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However, management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income, net income (loss) or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity's ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity's profitability because they do not include costs and expenses for depreciation and amortization, interest and related expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses, gains and losses, income taxes, intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs, gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs, loss on product recalls and distribution restructuring expenses. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP amounts.\n- 43 -\nA reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 along with the components of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA follows:\n\nWe use adjusted net income\u201d and adjusted diluted earnings per share,\u201d which are calculated as reported net income and reported diluted earnings per share adjusted for certain items that affect comparability. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments to reported net income and diluted earnings per share to eliminate the items identified below. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of our operating performance between periods and to view our business from the same perspective as our management. Because we cannot predict the timing and amount of these items, management does not consider these items when evaluating our performance or when making decisions regarding allocation of resources.\nA reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share to net income for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 along with the components of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share follows (in thousands):\n\n- 44 -\n\n (1) Non-recurring adjustment to deferred income taxes for fiscal 2017 relates to the revaluation of our opening deferred income taxes as a result of the U.S. Tax Act as if it had been enacted on January 1, 2017. Non-recurring adjustment to deferred income taxes for fiscal 2016 relates to a true-up of deferred income taxes resulting from our decision during the second quarter of 2016 to discontinue the Rickland Orchards brand and the related impairment of intangible assets. Non-recurring adjustment to deferred income taxes for fiscal 2015 relates to a true-up of deferred taxes for state apportionment as a result of the Green Giant and Mama Mary's acquisitions. \n (2) Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2017 includes the tax impact of the change in our effective tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $0.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and less than $0.1 million relating to the refinancing of our tranche B term loans. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amounts of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. \n (3) Acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses for fiscal 2017 primarily include acquisition and integration expenses for the Green Giant, spices & seasonings, Victoria and Back to Nature acquisitions, severance and hiring costs, a non-recurring interest charge relating to the refinancing of our credit agreement and a non-recurring startup surcharge paid to a co-packer. \n (4) Distribution restructuring expenses for fiscal 2016 and 2015 include expenses relating to our transitioning of the operations of our three primary shelf-stable distribution centers and a new fourth primary shelf-stable distribution center in the United States to a third party logistics provider. \n (5) Acquisition-related inventory step-up for fiscal 2017 relates to the purchase accounting adjustments made to the finished goods inventory acquired in the Back to Nature and spices & seasonings acquisitions. Acquisition-related inventory step-up for fiscal 2016 relates to the purchase accounting adjustments made to the finished goods inventory acquired in the spices & seasonings acquisition. Acquisition-related step-up for fiscal 2015 relates to the purchase accounting adjustments made to the finished goods inventory acquired in the Green Giant acquisition. \n (6) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a loss on disposal of inventory of $3.3 million. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. Accordingly, we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles of $4.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which are recorded in Impairment of intangible assets\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016. We also recorded a charge to cost of goods sold of approximately $0.8 million in connection with the write-off of raw materials and finished goods inventory used for the Rickland Orchards brand. \n (7) During fiscal 2017, we sold to a third-party co-packer our Le Sueur, Minnesota research center, including the seed technology assets, property, plant and equipment. We acquired the research center and related assets on November 2, 2015, as part of the Green Giant acquisition. The sale resulted in a $1.6 million loss on sale of assets. \nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $276.8 million, or approximately 20.0%, to $1.67 billion for fiscal 2017 from $1.39 billion in 2016. The net sales increase was due to an increase in unit volume of $287.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in net pricing of $10.7 million. The unit volume increase was primarily driven by an additional eleven plus months of net sales of the spices & seasonings business, acquired on November 21, 2016, an additional eleven months of net sales of Victoria, acquired on December 2, 2016, and three months of net sales of Back to Nature, acquired on October 2, 2017.\n- 45 -\nBase business net sales for fiscal 2017 decreased by approximately $15.0 million, or 1.1%. The decrease in base business net sales was driven by a decrease in unit volume of $4.3 million, or 0.3%, and a decrease in net pricing of $10.7 million, or 0.8%. Net sales of Green Giant frozen products, benefitting from the strong performance of new innovation products, increased $33.6 million, or 11.1%, and net sales of Pirate Brands, benefitting from new distribution gains, plus momentum from a strong back-to-school season and successful promotional events, increased $5.2 million, or 6.1%. Net sales of Green Giant shelf-stable products decreased $30.6 million, or 19.6%, primarily due to weak consumption trends and distribution losses with a key customer. Net sales of our maple syrup products decreased $7.0 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to the Company's decision during the first quarter of 2017 to discontinue certain private label sales. And net sales of Ortega decreased $3.0 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to heightened competitive activity. The overall decline in base business net sales in fiscal 2017 was concentrated in the first half of the year. Base business net sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 increased 1.2% compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016.\nThe spices & seasonings business and Victoria, each acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016, generated fiscal 2017 net sales of $260.7 million and $42.8 million, respectively, compared to our initial forecasts at the time of acquisition of $220.0 million of net sales for the spices & seasonings business and $41.0 million of net sales for Victoria.\nSee Note 15, Net Sales by Brand,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for detailed information regarding total net sales by brand for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 for each of our brands that equaled or exceeded approximately 3% of our fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands in the aggregate.\nThe following chart sets forth the most significant base business net sales increases and decreases by brand for fiscal 2017:\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $14.3 million, or 3.2%, to $462.2 million for fiscal 2017 from $448.0 million for fiscal 2016. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales was 27.7% for fiscal 2017 compared to 32.2% for fiscal 2016. Excluding the 2.5 percentage point impact due to product mix, gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.0 percentage points. Approximately 1.4 percentage points of the decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in warehousing and distribution costs and 0.6 percentage points of the decrease was due to a decrease in net pricing.\n- 46 -\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $205.2 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $30.5 million, or 17.4%. The increase was attributable to increased warehousing expenses of $12.8 million, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses of $11.4 million, selling expenses of $7.2 million (which includes increases on brokerage expenses of $5.9 million and $0.6 million of salesperson compensation) and consumer marketing expenses of $0.6 million, slightly offset by decreases of $1.3 million of distribution restructuring expenses and all other expenses of $0.2 million. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 0.3 percentage points to 12.3% for fiscal 2017 compared to 12.5% for 2016.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense increased $3.8 million to $17.6 million for fiscal 2017 from $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 due to the Back to Nature acquisition completed in fiscal 2017 and the spices & seasonings and Victoria acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets of $5.4 million for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards, as we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand during the second quarter of 2016 because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production.\nOperating Income. As a result of the foregoing, operating income decreased $14.6 million, or 5.7%, to $239.4 million for fiscal 2017 from $254.0 million for fiscal 2016. Operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.4% in fiscal 2017 from 18.3% in fiscal 2016.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense was $91.8 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $74.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to additional borrowings made in the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund the spices & seasonings acquisition and the Victoria acquisition and in the fourth quarter of 2017 to fund the Back to Nature acquisition, and our senior notes offerings in second quarter and fourth quarter of 2017. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt\u201d below.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2017 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $0.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. See Liquidity and Capital Resources -Debt\u201d below.\nOther Income. Other income for fiscal 2017 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.6 million. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense. Income tax (benefit) expense changed $137.0 million to a tax benefit of $(69.4) million in fiscal 2017 from a tax expense of $67.6 million for fiscal 2016. See U.S. Tax Act\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the recently enacted tax legislation on Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Without the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, our income tax expense for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately $57.1 million and our effective tax rate would have been 38.6%.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales increased $424.9 million, or 44.0%, to $1,391.3 million for fiscal 2016 from $966.4 million for fiscal 2015. An additional ten months of net sales of Green Giant, acquired on November 2, 2015, and an additional almost six months of net sales of Mama Mary's, acquired on July 10, 2015, contributed $397.6 million and $19.4 million, respectively, to the overall net sales increase. In addition, net sales of the spices & seasonings business, acquired on November 21, 2016, and net sales of Victoria, acquired on December 2, 2016, contributed $28.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, to the overall net sales increase.\n- 47 -\nBase business net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $20.9 million, or 2.5%, to $816.8 million from $837.7 million for fiscal 2015. The $20.9 million decrease was attributable to a decrease in unit volume of $14.2 million, or 1.7%, a decrease in net pricing of $6.0 million, or 0.7%, and the negative impact of currency fluctuations on foreign sales of approximately $0.7 million, or 0.1%.\nA primary driver of the decline in base business net sales for fiscal 2016 was our syrup business. The net sales of those brands declined in the aggregate $7.7 million for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to maple syrup price deflation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, which resulted in increased competition in the maple syrup category and contractually mandated price reductions with certain of our foodservice customers. Another significant factor in the decline in base business net sales for fiscal 2016 was the TrueNorth brand, which declined $6.4 million, or 33.9%. The TrueNorth net sales decline was primarily the result of historically high almond prices in 2015. In response to increased almond costs, we increased the selling price for TrueNorth products, which had a negative impact on consumer demand. Although we rolled back pricing as almond prices began to return to historical norms, consumer demand did not return to prior levels. Base business net sales were also negatively impacted by net sales of our Ortega products, which decreased $3.7 million, or 2.6%. A portion of the decrease was attributable to the effects of the product recall we announced in November 2014, which caused an increase in net sales of Ortega in fiscal 2015 due to customers restocking inventory of products affected by the recall, partially offset by $1.2 million of customer refunds related to the recall. $1.5 million of the decrease in net sales of Ortega was due to a net pricing decrease in fiscal 2016.\nSee Note 15, Net Sales by Brand,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for detailed information regarding total net sales by brand for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 for each of our brands that equaled or exceeded approximately 3% of our fiscal 2017 net sales and for all other brands in the aggregate.\nThe following chart sets forth the most significant base business net sales increases and decreases by brand for fiscal 2016:\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $158.4 million, or 54.7%, to $448.0 million for fiscal 2016 from $289.6 million for fiscal 2015. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.2% in fiscal 2016 from 30.0% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 2.2 percentage points. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by the acquisition of Green Giant. Gross profit percentage was also positively impacted by decreased costs for commodities, packaging and distribution for the base business and improved product mix, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact the decrease in base business sales volume had on cost absorption, a net reduction in base business pricing, and the impact of the write-off of Rickland Orchards inventory in connection with our decision to discontinue the brand. See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of this write-off.\n- 48 -\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $68.9 million, or 65.0%, to $174.8 million for fiscal 2016 from $105.9 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to the Green Giant acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses and distribution restructuring expenses increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2016. The remaining $58.9 million of the increase was attributable to increases in consumer marketing of $41.6 million, selling expenses of $8.7 million (which includes a $7.5 million increase in brokerage expenses and a $1.2 million increase in salesperson compensation), warehousing expenses of $7.4 million and general and administrative expenses of $1.2 million (primarily related to compensation). Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.5 percentage points to 12.5% for fiscal 2016 from 11.0% for fiscal 2015.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense increased $2.5 million to $13.8 million for fiscal 2016 from $11.3 million for fiscal 2015 due to the Victoria and spices & seasonings acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and the Green Giant and Mama Mary's acquisitions completed in fiscal 2015.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets. Impairment of intangible assets of $5.4 million for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards, as we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the impairment of intangible assets related to Rickland Orchards.\nOperating Income. As a result of the foregoing, operating income increased $81.6 million, or 47.4%, to $254.0 million for fiscal 2016 from $172.4 million for fiscal 2015. Operating income expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.3% in fiscal 2016 from 17.8% in fiscal 2015.\nNet Interest Expense. Net interest expense increased $23.4 million, or 45.6%, to $74.5 million for fiscal 2016 from $51.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional indebtedness outstanding during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of the Green Giant acquisition, the spices & seasonings acquisition, and the Victoria acquisition. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\u201d below.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2016 includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. We did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2015. See -Debt\u201d below.\nOther Income. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased $15.5 million to $67.6 million for fiscal 2016 from $52.1 million for fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for fiscal 2016 and 43.0% for fiscal 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity requirements include debt service, capital expenditures and working capital needs. See also, Dividend Policy\u201d and Commitments and Contractual Obligations\u201d below. We fund our liquidity requirements, as well as our dividend payments and financing for acquisitions, primarily through cash generated from operations and external sources of financing, including our revolving credit facility.\nCash Flows\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $251.9 million to $37.8 million for fiscal 2017 from $289.7 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects unfavorable working capital (comprised of changes in inventories, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses) comparisons to the fiscal year 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a\n- 49 -\nsignificant increase in inventory net of businesses acquired in 2017 compared to a decrease in inventory net of businesses acquired in 2016, and the timing of payments received from post-acquisition transition services agreements. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $161.2 million to $289.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $128.5 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the Green Giant acquisition, including the favorable impact of an increase in cash provided by working capital and higher net income for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $260.7 million to $220.5 million for fiscal 2017 from $481.2 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in payments made for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, and an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by an increase in capital spending. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 included expenditures for building improvements, purchases of manufacturing equipment, expenditures in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and capitalized interest.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2017 increased $143.3 million to $359.3 million from $216.0 million for fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year 2017 consisted of $914.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of our 5.25% senior notes and $395.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings, partially offset by $233.6 million repayment of our tranche A term loans, $571.0 million of repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings, $123.6 million of dividend payments, $19.5 million of debt financing costs and $2.0 million of payments of tax withholding on behalf of employees for net share settlement of share based compensation. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2016 decreased $551.4 million to $216.0 million from $767.4 million for fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to differences in the net effects of our equity offerings in March and August of 2016, prepayments of long-term debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. See -Debt\u201d below.\nCash Income Tax Payments. During fiscal 2017 we made cash tax payments of approximately $17.2 million even though we recorded a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes. See U.S. Tax Act\u201d above for a discussion of the impact and expected impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our cash income tax payments. Based on a number of factors, including amortization for tax purposes of our trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions, we realized a significant reduction in cash taxes in fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared to our tax expense for financial reporting purposes. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand, which resulted in a one-time cash taxes benefit of $17.3 million for fiscal 2016. We believe that we will realize a benefit to our cash taxes payable from amortization of our trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets for the taxable years 2018 through 2032. If there is a change in U.S. federal tax policy that reduces any of these available deductions or results in an increase in our corporate tax rate, our cash taxes payable may increase further, which could significantly reduce our future liquidity and impact our ability to make interest and dividend payments.\nDividend Policy\nFor a discussion of our dividend policy, see the information set forth under the heading Dividend Policy\u201d in Part II, Item 5 of this report.\nAcquisitions\nOur liquidity and capital resources have been significantly impacted by acquisitions and may be impacted in the foreseeable future by additional acquisitions. As discussed elsewhere in this report, as part of our growth strategy we plan to expand our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary brands. We have historically financed acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness, issuing equity and/or using cash flows from operating activities. Our interest expense has over time increased as a result of additional indebtedness we have incurred in connection with acquisitions and will increase with any additional indebtedness we may incur to finance future acquisitions. Although we may subsequently issue equity and use the proceeds to repay all or a portion of the additional indebtedness incurred to finance an acquisition and reduce our interest expense, the additional shares of common stock would increase the amount of cash flows from operating activities necessary to fund dividend payments.\n- 50 -\nWe financed the Mama Mary's acquisition, completed in July 2015, with cash on hand from the proceeds of a public offering of common stock we completed in May 2015. We financed the Green Giant acquisition, completed in November 2015, with additional indebtedness, and we repaid a portion of that additional indebtedness with the proceeds of a public offering of common stock we completed in March 2016. We financed the spices & seasonings acquisition, completed in November 2016, with cash on hand, including the net proceeds of our August 2016 public offering of common stock, and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. We financed the Victoria acquisition, completed in December 2016, with cash on hand and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. We financed the Back to Nature acquisition, completed in October 2017, with cash on hand and additional revolving loans under our existing credit facility. The impact of future acquisitions, whether financed with additional indebtedness or otherwise, may have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Agreement. In fiscal 2017, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility twice by amending and restating our senior secured credit agreement, first on March 30, 2017, and again on November 20, 2017.\nThe first refinancing, on March 30, 2017, reduced by 0.75% the spread over LIBOR or the applicable base rate on $640.1 million of tranche B term loans.\nOn April 3, 2017, we repaid all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans using a portion of the net proceeds of our registered public offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025.\nOn November 20, 2017, we again refinanced our senior secured credit facility. This second refinancing increased the principal amount of the tranche B term loans by $10 million to $650.1 million, reduced by 25 basis points the spread over LIBOR or the applicable base rate on the tranche B term loans and any revolving loans, increased the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $700 million, and extended the maturity date applicable to our revolving credit facility from June 2019 to November 2022.\nAt December 30, 2017, $650.1 million of tranche B term loans and no amount of revolving loans were outstanding under our credit agreement. During the first quarter of 2018, we made an optional prepayment of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. As of the date of this report, $600.1 million of tranche B term loans remains outstanding.\nOur credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries' assets except our and our domestic subsidiaries' real property.\nAt December 30, 2017, the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $2.2 million, was $697.8 million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar line of business as our company, subject to specified criteria. The revolving credit facility matures on November 21, 2022.\nThe entire $600.1 million principal amount of tranche B term loans outstanding are due and payable at maturity on November 2, 2022.\nInterest under the revolving credit facility, including any outstanding letters of credit is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, and LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, in each case depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.\nInterest under the tranche B term loan facility is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin of 1.00%, and LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. At December 30, 2017, the tranche B term loan interest rate was approximately 3.569%.\nFor further information regarding our credit agreement, including a description of optional and mandatory prepayment terms, and financial and restrictive covenants, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n- 51 -\n4.625% Senior Notes due 2021. On June 4, 2013, we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% senior notes to purchase or redeem all $248.5 million principal amount of our then existing 7.625% senior notes due 2018, to repay $222.2 million principal amount of our then existing tranche B term loans and approximately $40.0 million principal amount of revolving loans under our then existing credit agreement, and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses. We used the remaining net proceeds for our acquisition of Pirate Brands, completed in July 2013.\nInterest on the 4.625% senior notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.625% senior notes will mature on June 1, 2021, unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 4.625% senior notes as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 4.625% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 4.625% senior notes or exchanges of the 4.625% senior notes for equity securities or both, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 4.625% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 4.625% senior notes and/or exchanges of the 4.625% senior notes for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a more detailed description of the 4.625% senior notes.\n5.25% Senior Notes due 2025. On April 3, 2017, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. On November 20, 2017, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public 101% of their face value plus accrued interest from October 1, 2017, which equates to a yield to worst of 5.03%. The notes issued in November were issued as additional notes under the same indenture as our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 that were issued in April, and, as such, form a single series and trade interchangeably with the previously issued 5.25% senior notes.\nWe used the net proceeds of the April offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans, and to pay related fees and expenses. We used the net proceeds of the November offering to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We have used a portion of, and intend to use the remaining portion of, the net proceeds of the April and November offerings for general corporate purposes, which have included and could include, among other things, repayment of other long term debt or possible acquisitions.\nInterest on the 5.25% senior notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2017. The 5.25% senior notes will mature on April 1, 2025, unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% senior notes as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe may also, from time to time, seek to retire the 5.25% senior notes through cash repurchases of the 5.25% senior notes and/or exchanges of the 5.25% senior notes for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a more detailed description of the 5.25% senior notes.\nDeferred Debt Financing Costs. During fiscal 2017, we wrote off and expensed $0.9 million of debt financing costs in connection with the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and less than $0.1 million in connection with the refinancing of our tranche B term loans. During fiscal 2016, we wrote-off and expensed $2.2 million of debt financing costs in connection with the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. During fiscal 2015, we\n- 52 -\ncapitalized $14.5 million of debt financing costs relating to the tranche B term loans, which are being amortized over the seven year scheduled term of the tranche B term loans.\nFuture Capital Needs\nOn December 30, 2017, our total long-term debt of $2,217.6 million, net of our cash and cash equivalents of $206.5 million, was $2,011.1 million. Stockholders' equity as of that date was $880.8 million.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations depends generally on our results of operations and the availability of financing. Our management believes that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow from operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund operations, meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures, make future acquisitions, if any, and pay our anticipated quarterly dividends on our common stock.\nWe expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2018. Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 include anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 million to move equipment used in the production of certain Green Giant products from General Mills' Belvidere, Illinois manufacturing facility to an existing B&G Foods co-packer, approximately $2.0 million for new productivity projects, $5.5 million to fund infrastructure optimization projects, $3.6 million for IT infrastructure including cyber security, and approximately $12.4 million in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nSeasonality\nSales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or certain other annual events. In general our sales are higher during the first and fourth quarters.\nWe purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable vegetables, shelf-stable pickles, relishes, peppers, tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October, and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently, our liquidity needs are greatest during these periods.\nInflation\nWe are currently locked into pricing and supply for substantially all of our major commodities, other than maple syrup, through fiscal 2018 at a cost increase of less than 1% of cost of goods sold and will continue to manage inflation risk by entering into short term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements from time to time, and, if necessary, by raising prices. During each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we had a minimal cost decrease. To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs, implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if input costs begin to decline, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nContingencies\nSee Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2(s), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n- 53 -\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 30, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations and commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness, future minimum operating lease obligations, future purchase obligations and future pension obligations as set forth in the following table as of December 30, 2017.\n\n (1) Expected interest payments on long-term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding, scheduled maturity dates and interest rates at December 30, 2017. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for further information as to our long-term debt interest obligations. \n (2) For the purposes of this table, purchase obligations means agreements to purchase goods or services (such as raw materials, commodities, packaging, other materials and supplies and co-manufacturing arrangements) that are enforceable and legally binding on B&G Foods and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations in the above table do not represent our entire expected future purchases for goods and services, which are significantly higher than the amounts set forth above. The table does not include purchase obligations under contracts that may be cancelled by B&G Foods without material penalty. Any amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the purchase obligations set forth in the table above. Penalties, if any, related to molds and equipment based upon failure to meet minimum volume requirements are also excluded from the table because we are unable to determine whether such penalties will be incurred and, if incurred, over what time period they will be paid. \n (3) We expect to make $1.1 million of defined pension benefit contributions during fiscal 2018. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of pension contributions and contribution amounts beyond fiscal 2018. \nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements, including without limitation the statements under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d estimates,\u201d projects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

20% to $1.67 billion in fiscal 2017, primarily driven by acquisitions. Base business net sales decreased 1.1% due to lower net pricing and a small decline in unit volume.\n\n- Gross profit margin decreased from 32.2% to 27.7%, impacted by product mix and higher warehousing and distribution costs. \n\n- Operating income decreased 6% to $239 million, representing a 14.4% operating margin compared to 18.3% in the prior year. This was driven by the gross margin decline.\n\n- Net income increased significantly to $217 million due to a large tax benefit resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Excluding this, net income would have declined.\n\n- Cash from operations decreased from $290 million to $38 million, negatively impacted by unfavorable working capital changes.\n\n- The company completed several acquisitions during 2017 and refinanced its debt on favorable terms to support growth. It expects capital expenditures of $50-55 million in 2018.\n\n- Key challenges include higher input costs, competitive pressures, changing consumer preferences, credit market conditions, currency fluctuations, and cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn summary, while sales and profits grew in 2017 aided by acquisitions, underlying base business trends were slightly negative. But the company took actions to strengthen its balance sheet and sees acquisition-driven growth continuing."}
