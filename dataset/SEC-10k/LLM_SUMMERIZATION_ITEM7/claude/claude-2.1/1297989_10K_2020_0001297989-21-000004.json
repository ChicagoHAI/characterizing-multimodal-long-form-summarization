Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements. Dollar amounts within Item 7 are presented as actual, rounded, dollar amounts.\nWe have described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the impact of the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d) on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" below and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding risks and uncertainties relating to COVID-19.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should not place undue reliance on these statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These statements often include words such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate\u201d or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below are, and will be, amplified by COVID-19. These factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 and related response measures on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the impact of governmental lockdowns and other restrictions on our operations and processes and those of our clients and suppliers;\n\u2022our dependence on a limited number of clients in a limited number of industries;\n\u2022worldwide political, economic or business conditions;\n\u2022negative public reaction in the U.S. or elsewhere to offshore outsourcing;\n\u2022fluctuations in our earnings;\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain clients including in a timely manner;\n\u2022our ability to successfully consummate or integrate strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022our ability to accurately estimate and/or manage the costs and/or timing of winding down businesses;\n\u2022restrictions on immigration;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations;\n\u2022our ability to grow our business or effectively manage growth and international operations;\n\u2022any changes in the senior management team;\n\u2022increasing competition in our industry;\n\u2022telecommunications or technology disruptions or breaches, natural or other disasters, or medical epidemics or pandemics;\n\u2022our ability to withstand the loss of a significant customer;\n\u2022our ability to realize the entire book value of goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions;\n\u2022our ability to make accurate estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022regulatory, legislative and judicial developments, including changes to or the withdrawal of governmental fiscal incentives;\n\u2022changes in tax laws or decisions regarding repatriation of funds held abroad;\n\u2022ability to service debt or obtain additional financing on favorable terms;\n\u2022legal liability arising out of customer contracts;\n\u2022technological innovation;\n\u2022political or economic instability in the geographies in which we operate;\n\u2022operational and information security failures arising as a result of remote work solutions adopted due to COVID-19;\n\u2022cyber security incidents, data breaches, or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data; and\n\u2022adverse outcome of our disputes with the Indian tax authorities.\nIn particular, you should consider the numerous risks outlined in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These and other risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or elsewhere, speak only as of the date on which they were made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as required by federal securities laws.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a leading operations management and analytics company that helps our clients build and grow sustainable businesses. By orchestrating our domain expertise, data, analytics and digital technology, we look deeper to design and manage agile, customer-centric operating models to improve global operations, drive profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, increase data-driven insights, and manage risk and compliance. We serve customers in multiple industries, including insurance, healthcare, banking and financial services, utilities, travel, transportation and logistics, media and retail, among others.\nWe operate in the business process management ( BPM\u201d) industry and we provide operations management and analytics services. Effective January 1, 2020, we made certain operational and structural changes to more closely integrate our businesses and to simplify our organizational structure. Since then, we have managed and reported financial information through our four strategic business units: Insurance, Healthcare, Analytics and Emerging Business, which reflects how management reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. In line with our strategy of vertical integration and focus on domain expertise, we integrated our Finance & Accounting and Consulting operating segments within each of the Insurance and Healthcare operating segments based on the respective industry-specific clients. Finance & Accounting and Consulting services provided to clients outside of those industries, are part of our Emerging Business\u201d segment. In addition, we integrated our former Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Banking and Financial Services, and Utilities operating segments under Emerging Business\u201d to further leverage and optimize the operating scale in providing operations management services.\nOur reportable segments effective January 1, 2020 are as follows:\n\u2022Insurance,\n\u2022Healthcare,\n\u2022Analytics, and\n\u2022Emerging Business\nIn conjunction with the new reporting structure, we recast our segment and goodwill disclosures for all prior periods presented to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.\nOur global delivery network, which includes highly trained industry and process specialists across the United States, Latin America, South Africa, Europe and Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), is a key asset. We have operations centers in\nIndia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Bulgaria, Colombia, South Africa, Romania and the Czech Republic.\nContinued Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially impact worldwide economic activity and levels of business confidence and has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. During the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on our business, however, in subsequent quarters, COVID-19 materially impacted us. Our customers, contractors, suppliers, and other partners were prevented from conducting business activities as usual, including due to the health and safety measures in response to COVID-19, such as shutdowns, which were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The disruption adversely affected our ability to provide our services and solutions and resulted in, among other things, significant loss of revenue, increased costs and the possibility of enhanced credit risk on our accounts receivable, which is reflected in our financial operating results. The continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected has disrupted the continuity of our provision of services to our customers and adversely impacted our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have a business continuity plan in place and have adapted delivery to a work from home model, while actively working to understand our clients' changing requirements, continuing to ensure data security, prioritizing critical processes, adjusting service levels and managing discretionary costs (such as travel costs) and fixed costs (such as non-critical personnel costs). While travel restrictions had a short-term impact on our ability to deliver our services in 2020, we have been working to reduce our reliance on travel by incorporating into our business model the ability to conduct business using virtual conferencing and collaboration tools. Our work from home delivery capability steadily improved throughout the year. We estimate that we are able to deliver over 95% of our clients' current requirements in a work from home model given the current lockdown restrictions in the locations in which we operate and certain clients not authorizing us to perform the remaining process work remotely due to its sensitive nature. In addition, we have also worked, and continue to work with national, state, and local authorities to comply with applicable rules and regulations related to COVID-19. There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world. Despite the efforts described above, there is a risk that if jurisdictions in which we operate reinstate prior restrictions, stagnate in their reopening processes, or implement new restrictions in response to new outbreaks or continued spread, our operations and business could be materially impacted.\nWe also took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on helping our employees. These actions included disseminating guidance and information to our employees, facilitating work from home, implementing best practices for employees while working from home, periodic CEO messaging, various programs aimed at employee wellness, including a global wellness program, enhanced leave for employees affected by COVID-19, enhanced awareness towards information security, and updated cyber security and data privacy policies, among others. We have implemented broad travel restrictions and largely moved to virtual-only events for the safety of our employees and our customers. We also implemented pandemic-specific protocols for our essential employees whose jobs require them to be on-site or with our customers by implementing additional safety measures at all of our facilities, including increased frequency in cleaning and disinfecting, and enhanced hygiene and social distancing practices.\nWe incurred additional costs in order to ensure the continuity of our operations and shift towards a work from home model. Such costs include purchase of desktops and laptops for our employees, software and internet connectivity devices, technology tools for productivity enhancement, accommodation, meal, overtime, transportation and regular sanitization and cleaning costs of our offices and facilities. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our work from home model, implement new information technology solutions and security measures to safeguard against information security risks and protect the health and safety of our employees as they gradually return to the office. We believe that these short-to-medium-term costs may benefit us in the long-term, as these steps have broadened our remote working\u201d capabilities, which we expect to become a permanent feature in our future delivery model, as well as our business continuity plans.\nIn response to certain anticipated impacts from COVID-19, we also implemented a series of temporary cost reduction measures to further preserve financial flexibility. These actions included the postponement of certain discretionary spending including travel and marketing expenses, reevaluating the pace of our capital expenditures, rationalizing certain of our real estate and facilities, deferring scheduled increases in base salaries, deferring non-critical hiring, temporarily reducing the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees among others. Some of these actions have been reversed as of December 31, 2020.\nWe also took certain precautionary measures to maintain financial flexibility during this time, including drawing $100.0 million from our line of credit under our Credit Agreement on March 12, 2020, the proceeds of which were available for\nworking capital, general corporate or other purposes as needed, and which was repaid in full on April 20, 2020. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, management elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under the 2019 Repurchase Program. We resumed share repurchases effective July 1, 2020, considering improved market conditions, our capital and liquidity needs and other factors.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow in fiscal year 2020 has been explained in the discussion below, however the full extent of the impact for the period beyond the fiscal year 2020 is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic and prevent or limit any reoccurrence; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when COVID-19 subsides. Due to the above circumstances and as described generally in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our financial results, including but not limited to net revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow and earnings per share, in future periods may differ materially from historical trends. We continue to monitor the implications of COVID-19 on our business, as well as our customers' and suppliers' businesses.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill quantitative impairment test for any potential impairment. We considered the effects of COVID-19 on our significant inputs used in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Based on the results, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and the goodwill was not impaired. However, there can be no assurances that goodwill will not be impaired in future periods. Estimating the fair value of goodwill requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. These estimates and judgments may not be within the control of us and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change in future periods.\nFor additional information and risks related to COVID-19, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $958.4 million compared to revenues of $991.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $32.9 million, or 3.3%.\nWe serve clients mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, with these two regions generating 85.0% and 9.3%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 82.5% and 11.4%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for 37.4% and 36.1% of our total revenues, respectively. Our revenue concentration with our top clients remains largely consistent year-over-year and we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our top ten clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur Business\nWe provide operations management and analytics services. We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by key industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the United States, Europe and Australia.\nOperations Management Services: We provide our clients with a range of operations management services from our Insurance, Healthcare and Emerging Business operating segments, which typically involve the transfer by our clients to EXL of certain of their business operations, such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage those operations on an ongoing basis. As part of this transfer, we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant business operations, implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client's customers. Each client contract has different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement. We also provide consulting services related to operations management that include industry-specific digital transformational services as well as cross-industry finance and accounting services as part of the Emerging Business operating segment.\nWe provide our services under contracts with our clients, which typically have terms of three or more years, with some being rolling contracts with no end dates. Typically, our clients can terminate these contracts with or without cause and with short notice periods. These contracts provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our operations management business. However, we have a long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of entering into definitive agreements with new clients. Similarly, new license sales and implementation projects for our technology service platforms and other software-based services have a long selling cycle, however ongoing annual maintenance and support contracts for existing arrangements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base.\nWe charge for our services using various pricing models like time-and-material pricing, full-time-equivalent pricing, transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing, subscription-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. Outcome-based pricing arrangements are examples of non-linear pricing models where clients link revenues from platforms and solutions and the services we provide to usage or savings rather than the efforts deployed to provide these services. We continue to observe a shift in the industry pricing models toward transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. We believe this trend will continue and we use such alternative pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a full-time-equivalent pricing model to a transaction-based or other alternative pricing model. These alternative pricing models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our gross margins.\nWe have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi-vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs. We believe that the trend toward multi-vendor relationships will continue. A multi-vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor, which can result in significantly reduced gross margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor. To the extent our large clients expand their use of multi-vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors, our gross margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients to meet competition.\nAnalytics: We help our clients unlock deep insights from data and create data driven solutions. Our analytics services focus on driving improved business outcomes for our customers by unlocking deep insights from data and create data driven solutions across all parts of our customers' business. We also provide care optimization and reimbursement optimization services, for our clients through our healthcare analytics solutions and services. We also offer integrated solutions to help our clients in cost containment by leveraging technology platforms, customizable and configurable analytics and expertise in healthcare reimbursements to help clients enhance their claim payment accuracy. Our teams deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics in the areas of customer acquisition and lifecycle management, risk underwriting and pricing, operational effectiveness, credit and operational risk monitoring and governance, regulatory reporting, payment integrity and care management and data management. We enhance, modernize and enrich structured and unstructured data and use a spectrum of advanced analytical tools and techniques, including our in-house Machine Learning ( ML\u201d) and Artificial Intelligence ( AI\u201d) capabilities to create insights and improve decision making for our clients. We actively cross-sell and, where appropriate, integrate our Analytics services with other operations management services as part of a comprehensive offering for our clients.\nWe anticipate that revenues from our analytics services will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base, both organically and through acquisitions.\nExpenses\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues primarily consists of:\n\u2022employee costs, which include salary, bonus and other compensation expenses; recruitment and training costs; employee insurance; transport; rewards and recognition for certain employees; and non-cash stock compensation expense; and\n\u2022costs relating to our facilities and communications network, which include telecommunication and IT costs; facilities and customer management support; operational expenses for our operations centers; rent expenses; and\n\u2022travel and other billable costs to our clients; and\n\u2022costs relating to our direct mail operations and other digital solutions.\nThe most significant components of our cost of revenues are salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation), recruitment, training, transport, meals, rewards and recognition and employee insurance. Salary levels, employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues. Salary increases for most of our operations personnel are generally awarded each year effective April 1. However, during 2020, in response to certain anticipated impacts from COVID-19, we implemented a series of temporary cost reduction measures including deferring the scheduled increases in base salaries of all eligible employees and temporarily reducing the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees. Some of these actions have been reversed as of December 31, 2020. We make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements. Although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated, a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher-than-expected number of unassigned employees, which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees, particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services, would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency, productivity and profit margins. In addition, cost of revenues also includes non-cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients.\nWe expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operating centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally. In particular, we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients and provide existing staff with additional skill sets. There is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients. As our existing competitors continue to grow, and as new competitors enter the market, we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase, with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our work from home model, invest in information technology solutions and security measures to safeguard against information security risks and costs to protect the health and safety of our employees as they gradually return to the office. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d under Risks Related to Our Business-Employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin\u201d and under Risks Related to the International Nature of Our Business-If more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize, our profitability may be adversely affected.\u201d However, a significant portion of our client contracts include inflation-based adjustments to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues.\nWe generally experience a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during the initial 12 to 18 months in a long-term BPM contract due to upfront investments in infrastructure, resource hiring and training during migration. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues improve as we scale up, achieve operational efficiencies and complete the migration.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nOur general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries and benefits (including stock based compensation) as well as costs related to recruitment, training and retention of senior management and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities, travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs. General and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees (which represent the costs of third party legal, tax, accounting and other advisors), investment in product development, digital technology, advanced automation and robotics, bad debt allowance and non-cash amortization of stock compensation expenses related to our issuance of equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect our G&A costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development, performance management and training programs.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits (including stock based compensation) and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel, sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation of our tangible assets, including network equipment, cabling, computers, office furniture and equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets. As we add new facilities and expand our existing operations centers, we expect that depreciation expense will increase, reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers, servers and other infrastructure. We expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges pertain to the write down of carrying values to fair values of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We perform our annual impairment test annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, for all our reporting units and intangible assets. Based on the results, if the carrying values of our reporting units exceeds their fair values, we record impairment charges to the extent that carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Such assets are required to be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of the assets is higher than the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets. The impairment amount to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value.\nForeign Exchange\nWe report our financial results in the U.S. dollar. However, a significant portion of our total revenues are earned in the U.K. pound sterling (8.3% and 10.2%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019), while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in Indian rupees (27.2% and 25.6%, respectively, of our total costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019) and the Philippine peso (11.5% and 7.9%, of our total costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019). The exchange rates among the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future as well. The results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso and the U.K. pound sterling appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 - Derivatives and Hedge Accounting to our consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.\u201d\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consist of interest on our borrowings under our credit facility and convertible senior notes, finance lease liabilities and notional interest implicit in the purchase of property and equipment.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gain/(loss) on sale, mark to market and dividend income on our investments in mutual funds, and interest on time deposits classified under Cash and cash equivalents\u201d, Short-term investments\u201d and Other assets\u201d, as applicable on our consolidated balance sheets. Other income, net also consists of changes in fair value of earn-out consideration, interest on refunds received from income tax authorities in India on completion of tax assessments and components of net periodic benefit cost such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gain or loss and profit or loss on disposal of long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Our tax expense and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations and the potential adverse outcome of tax examinations. Changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which may result from a decline in our profitability or changes in tax rates or legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense.\nDuring the year 2018, we made an election to change the tax status of most of our controlled foreign corporations ( CFC\u201d) to disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we no longer have undistributed earnings in connection with these CFCs. The Transition Tax resulted in previously taxed income ( PTI\u201d) which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency gains or losses upon repatriation. We periodically evaluate opportunities to repatriate PTI held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to repatriate such PTI, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions.\nIn 2019, the Government of India introduced a new tax regime for certain Indian companies by enacting the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019. The new tax regime is optional and provides for a lower tax rate for Indian companies, subject to certain conditions, which among other things includes not availing of specified exemptions or incentives. During the year 2019 and 2020, we elected this new tax regime for our Indian subsidiaries to obtain the benefit of a lower tax rate.\nWe also benefited from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for our operations centers established there over the last several years. The tax holiday expired for few of our centers in last few years and will expire for other centers by year 2022,\nwhich may lead to an increase in our overall tax rate. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in the Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate, which as of December 31, 2020 was 5.0% on gross income.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. We determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain at the time an estimate is made. These policies include revenue recognition, allowance for expected credit losses, business combinations, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, derivative instruments and hedging activity, borrowings, assumptions related to lease liabilities, ROU assets, lease cost, income taxes and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans. These accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below. Future events may not develop exactly as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when services are provided to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services provided.\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes discounts and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by providing services to a customer.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nSignificant judgments\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe sometimes enter into contracts with our clients which include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the client. Determining whether products and services are considered as distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately rather than as one performance obligation may require significant judgment. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations on relative standalone selling price basis.\nJudgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, it is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nVariable Consideration\nVariability in the transaction price arises primarily due to service level agreements and volume discounts.\nWe consider our experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration that should be recognized during a period.\nWe believe that the expected value method is most appropriate for determining the variable consideration since we have a large number of contracts with similar nature of transactions/services.\nType of Contracts Requiring Judgment\na.Revenues for our fixed-price contracts are recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. The use of this method requires significant judgment to estimate the cost required to complete the contracted scope of work, including\nassumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and resources engaged. We regularly monitor these estimates throughout the execution of the project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined. If a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project, such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified.\nb.Revenues from reimbursement optimization services having contingent fee arrangements are recognized by us at the point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon the actual collections made by our customers and net of any subsequent retraction claims. Based on guidance on variable consideration\u201d in Topic 606, we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue based upon such expected recoveries. Any adjustment required due to change in estimates are recorded in the period in which such change is identified.\nFor additional information, see Note 5 - Revenues, net to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nUnbilled Receivables\nUnbilled receivables represent revenues recognized for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date. Unbilled receivables also include revenues recognized from reimbursement optimization services where we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon and collectable only when the actual collections are made by our customers. Based on guidance on variable consideration\u201d in Topic 606, we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue and receivables based upon such expected recoveries. Accordingly, the amounts for which services have been performed and for which invoices have not been issued to customers on the balance sheet date, (i.e. unbilled receivables) are presented under accounts receivable.\nDeferred Revenue and contract fulfillment costs\nWe have contract liabilities (deferred revenue) consisting of advance billings and billing in excess of revenues recognized. Deferred revenue also includes the amount for which services have been rendered but other conditions of revenue recognition are not met, for example where we do not have an enforceable contract.\nFurther, we also defer revenues attributable to certain process transition activities, with respect to our customers where such activities do not represent separate performance obligations. Revenues related to such transition activities are classified under Deferred revenue\u201d and Other non-current liabilities\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are performed.\nCosts related to such transition activities are contract fulfillment costs, and thereby classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers, under Cost of revenues\u201d in our consolidated statements of income.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nDirect and incremental costs incurred for acquiring contracts, such as sales commissions are contract acquisition costs and thereby classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers and recorded under Selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nUpfront Payment Made to Customers\nUpfront payments in nature of deal signing discount or deal signing bonuses made to customers are contract assets and classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit and are recorded as an adjustment to transaction price and reduced from revenues.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\nWe record accounts receivable net of allowances for expected credit losses. Allowances for credit losses are established through the evaluation of aging of accounts receivables, prior collection experience, current market conditions, forecasts about future economic conditions, clients' financial condition and the amount of accounts receivable in dispute to estimate the collectability of these accounts receivable.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations\u201d. The guidance requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in allocation of the purchase price in determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets and contingent consideration and allocation of purchase price over such assets and liabilities on the acquisition date. The significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on, among other things, anticipated growth rates and customer attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the reporting units to which it is assigned. We undertake studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and allocate purchase consideration to assets and liabilities, including property and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangibles. We examine the carrying value of the goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. We also assesses any potential goodwill impairment for our reporting units immediately prior to any segment changes and reallocate goodwill basis the new reporting units.\nThe goodwill quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of the income approach, using discounted cash flow analysis ( DCF model\u201d), and also the market approach, using market multiples for reporting units whereby the fair value is not substantially in excess of carrying value. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The discount rate is mainly based on judgment of the specific risk inherent within each reporting unit. The variables within the discount rate, many of which are outside of our control, provide us best estimate of all assumptions applied within the DCF model. Discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations range from 10.4% to 12.0%. We also use the Market approach\u201d to corroborate the results of the income approach for some of our reporting units. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit and comparable market transactions. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nDetermining fair value requires the use of estimates and exercise of significant judgment, including assumptions about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market multiples of revenues and earnings and comparable market transactions. These estimates and judgements may not be within our control and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the estimates and judgments described above could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized, in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of discounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The estimate of discounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, risk-free rates, market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nStock-based Compensation\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC No. 718\u201d), cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised and the expected volatility of our stock.\nWe also grant performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs\u201d) to executive officers and other specified employees. Generally the grants provide that 50% of the PRSUs cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on an aggregated revenue target ( PUs\u201d) for a three-year period. The remaining 50% vest based on a market condition ( MUs\u201d) that is contingent on EXL meeting or exceeding the total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies specified under the program, measured over a three-year performance period. The award recipient may earn up to 200% of the PRSUs granted based on the actual achievements of both targets. However, the features of our equity incentive compensation program are subject to change by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\nThe fair value of each PU is determined based on the market price of one share of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value for the MUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates a range of possible future stock prices and estimates the probabilities of the potential payouts. The Monte Carlo simulation model also involves the use of additional key assumptions, including dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. We periodically assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and update our estimates as required. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn the normal course of business, we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into various foreign currency exchange forward contracts, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.\nWe hedge forecasted transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, until the hedged transactions occurs. The resultant foreign exchange gain/(loss) upon settlement of these cash flow hedges is recorded along with the underlying hedged item in the same line in our consolidated statements of income as either part of Cost of revenues\u201d, General and administrative expenses\u201d, Selling and marketing expenses\u201d, or Depreciation and amortization expense\u201d, as applicable.\nWe also use derivative instruments consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts to economically hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. These derivatives do not qualify as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain/(loss).\nWe determine the fair value of our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts. The quotes are taken primarily from independent sources, including highly rated financial institutions.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness of cash flow hedges at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period, any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings.\nBorrowings\nWe account for convertible notes in accordance with the guidelines established by the ASC No. 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. We separate the convertible notes into liability and equity components. The Beneficial Conversion Feature (\"BCF\") of a convertible note, which is the equity component and recorded as additional paid-in capital, is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature of certain notes payable that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or in-the-money when issued. We record a BCF related to any issuance of convertible notes.\nIf a convertible note is within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections contains embedded features other than the embedded conversion option, the guidance in ASC No. 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging - Embedded Derivatives ( ASC 815-15\u201d), is applied to determine if any of those features must be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument.\nThe estimated fair value of the liability component at issuance is determined using a discounted cash flow technique, which considers debt issuances with similar features of our convertible notes, excluding the conversion feature. The excess of the gross proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component is allocated to the BCF, which is credited to additional paid-in-capital with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the convertible notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the convertible notes using the effective interest method.\nDirect, incremental finance costs related to the convertible notes are amortized over the term instrument through charges to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nWe may elect to settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. We presently intend and have the ability to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income tax using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved. Deferred tax assets are recognized in full, subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. With respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday, deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday.\nWe also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required. A reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is probable and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such reserves are based on estimates and, consequently, are subject to changing facts and circumstances, including the progress of ongoing audits, changes in case law and the passage of new legislation. We believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover any current tax assessments.\nDuring the year 2018, we made an election to change the tax status of most of our controlled foreign corporations ( CFC\u201d) to disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we no longer have undistributed earnings in connection with these CFCs. The Transition Tax resulted in previously taxed income ( PTI\u201d) which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency gains or losses upon repatriation. We periodically evaluate opportunities to repatriate PTI held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to repatriate such PTI, we may have to accrue additional taxes which will be recorded in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. See Note 22 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nWe employ a two-step process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining, based on the technical merits, that the position will, more likely than not, be sustained upon examination. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe record contributions to defined contribution plans in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which services are rendered by the covered employees. Current service costs for defined benefit plans are recognized in the period to which they relate. The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated annually by using the projected unit credit method and various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, mortality, expected return on assets, expected increase in the compensation rates and attrition rates. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually. If actual results differ\nsignificantly from our estimates, current service costs for defined benefit plans and our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe include the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the respective employees during the period. The interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/loss, are included in - Other income, net\u201d. See Note 20 - Employee Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nWe recognize the liabilities for compensated absences dependent on whether the obligation is attributable to employee services already rendered, relates to rights that vest or accumulate and payment is probable and estimable.\nLeases\nWe account for a lease at the inception of the contract. Operating leases are recorded in Operating lease right-of-use assets\u201d, Current portion of operating lease liabilities\u201d and Operating lease liabilities, less current portion\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are recorded in Property and equipment, net\u201d, and the current and non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are presented within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d and Other non-current liabilities,\u201d respectively in our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease arrangement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate at commencement date by adjusting the benchmark reference rates, applicable to the respective geographies where the leases are entered, with appropriate financing spreads and lease specific adjustments for the effects of collateral.\nLease terms includes our assessment for the effects of options to extend or terminate the lease. We consider the extension option as part of our lease term for those lease arrangements where we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.\nWe account for lease-related concessions to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 on lessees in accordance with guidance in Topic 842, Leases, to determine, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether the concession provided by lessor should be accounted for as a lease modification.\nWe account for a modification as a separate contract when it grants an additional right of use not included in the original lease and the increase is commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use, adjusted for the circumstances of the particular contract. Modifications which are not accounted for as a separate contract are reassessed as of the effective date of the modification based on its modified terms and conditions and the facts and circumstances as of that date. The lease liability is remeasured to reflect changes to the remaining lease payments and discount rates and we recognize the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. However, if the carrying amount of the ROU assets is reduced to zero as a result of modification, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nContingencies\nLoss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, we do not record a liability, but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Significant judgment is required in the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable, both. Our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table

The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, which was primarily related to clients adapting to the shift in our delivery capabilities from a physical to a virtual, work-from-home operating environment as well as economic uncertainty leading to lower volumes from some existing clients and causing delays in the execution and implementation of new client contracts, which impacted growth.\nRevenue decline in Insurance of $4.6 million was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by expansion of business from certain existing clients aggregating to $3.4 million and a decline in revenues of $1.3 million attributable to the depreciation of the Indian rupee and South African ZAR against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Insurance revenues were 35.7% and 34.9% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Healthcare of $3.7 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $16.2 million, partially offset by our December 2019 wind-down of Health Integrated business revenues of $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Healthcare revenues were 10.6% and 9.8% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue decline in Emerging Business of $37.4 million was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19 and ramp-down of certain client contracts aggregating to $35.6 million, and a decline of $1.8 million attributable to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Emerging Business revenues were 15.9% and 19.2% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Analytics of $5.4 million was attributable to our recurring and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients, partially offset by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19 aggregating to $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 34.9% compared to 33.9% for year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 100 basis points (\"bps\").\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Insurance of $6.7 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $4.0 million, lower travel costs of $4.4 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.2 million. This was partially offset by higher infrastructure and technology costs of $3.3 million, primarily related to the work from home enablement and other operating costs of $0.6 million. Gross margin in Insurance increased by 110 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to expansion in margin in certain existing clients, partially offset by COVID-19 related incremental expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $4.0 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $3.1 million, lower travel costs of $0.5 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $0.4 million. Gross margin in Healthcare increased by 690 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower margin in the Heath Integrated business during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by COVID-19 related incremental expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $19.1 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $14.2 million, lower infrastructure and technology costs of $2.5 million, lower travel costs of $1.9 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher other operating costs of $0.8 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business decreased by 150 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower revenues and COVID-19 related incremental expenses.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Analytics of $1.8 million was primarily due to lower other operating costs of $6.7 million, lower travel costs of $4.6 million, foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.2 million and lower infrastructure costs of $1.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related costs of $10.5 million and technology costs of $2.3 million. Gross margin in Analytics increased by 140 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher revenues and expansion in margin in certain existing clients.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nchange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing expenses </td> <td>60.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in SG&A expenses of $24.7 million was primarily due to COVID-19 cost reduction measures, including the temporary reduction of the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees.

The increase in depreciation expense of $5.7 million was primarily due to depreciation related to our investments in new operating centers, internally developed software and accelerated depreciation resulting from a reduction in useful lives related to several operating centers, due to the impact of COVID-19.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and restructuring charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.1 million and impairment charges of $3.6 million in connection with the wind-down of our Health Integrated business.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations increased by $33.6 million, or 43.9%, from $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower SG&A expenses of $24.7 million and impairment and restructuring charges of $8.7 million incurred in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations increased from 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss). Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to the movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling, the Philippine peso, and the South African ZAR during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 70.36 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 74.07 during the year ended December 31, 2020.

We recorded income tax expense of $25.6 million and $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of (i) higher profit during the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) recording of a one-time tax expense of $1.3 million due to electing a new tax regime for two of our Indian subsidiaries which provides for a lower tax rate on earnings in exchange for foregoing certain tax credits during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $1.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income. Net income increased from $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $33.6 million, lower interest expense of $2.4 million and higher foreign exchange gain, net of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $10.4 million and decrease in other income, net of $4.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues.\nThe following table summarizes our revenues by reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>346.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emerging Business </td> <td>190.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analytics </td> <td>357.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>991.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>883.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $991.3 million, up $108.2 million, or 12.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue growth in Insurance of $35.2 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $38.6 million. This was partially offset by $3.4 million mainly attributable to the depreciation of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, U.K. pound sterling and South African ZAR against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Insurance revenues were 34.9% and 35.2% of our total revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Healthcare of $7.7 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $12.9 million, partially offset by lower revenues from our Health Integrated business of $5.2 million.

Further decline of $2.0 million was mainly due to the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Emerging Business revenues were 19.2% and 22.3% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Analytics of $72.0 million was primarily driven by our acquisition of SCIOinspire Holdings Inc. ( SCIO\u201d), a health analytics solution and services company, in July 2018 and increase in revenues from our recurring and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients. This was partially offset by $1.0 million attributable to the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling and Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Analytics revenues were 36.0% and 32.3% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin: The following table sets forth cost of revenues and gross margin of our reportable segments.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Cost of Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Margin </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>77.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emerging Business </td> <td>108.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analytics </td> <td>231.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>584.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of revenues was $655.5 million compared to $584.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $70.7 million, or 12.1%. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 33.9% compared to 33.8% for year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 10 bps.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Insurance of $26.8 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $24.3 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, increase in technology cost of $3.4 million and increase in infrastructure and travel cost of $2.9 million. This was partially offset by lower other operating costs of $1.1 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.7 million. Gross margin in Insurance decreased by 80 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher operating expenses.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $6.7 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $7.3 million and higher other operating costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.0 million. Gross margin in Healthcare decreased by 70 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher operating expenses associated with the initiation of services for new and existing clients.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $9.4 million was primarily due to decrease in employee-related costs of $4.2 million, lower infrastructure and travel cost of $3.2 million, lower other operating costs of $0.4 million, and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.6 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business increased by 280 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to expansion in margin in certain new and existing clients.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Analytics of $46.6 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $42.7 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, including incremental cost related to our acquisition of SCIO in July 2018. The remaining increase was attributable to other operating costs of $5.8 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.9 million. Gross margin in Analytics during 2019 as compared to 2018 was flat.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing expenses </td> <td>71.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in SG&A expenses of $18.9 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $19.5 million, including incremental costs related to our SCIO acquisition in July 2018 and net increase in other operating costs of $1.0 million.

This was partially offset by currency movements, net of hedging of $0.6 million. The increase in intangibles amortization expense of $1.2 million was primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with our SCIO acquisition in July 2018, partially offset by the impact of amortization of intangibles related to our Health Integrated acquisition, which were impaired during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and restructuring charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.1 million and impairment charges of $3.6 million in connection with the wind down of Health Integrated business within our Healthcare operating segment.

See Note 10 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 24 - Impairment and Restructuring Charges to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations increased by $26.6 million, or 53.5%, from $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations increased from 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss). Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 68.48 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 70.36 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.33 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 1.28 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso decreased from 52.69 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 51.57 during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the net foreign exchange gain of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increase in average borrowings on account of issuance of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2018 and higher effective interest rates under our Credit Facility.\nOther Income, net\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale and mark-to-market of mutual funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Others, net </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income, net increased by $3.5 million, from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a higher return on mutual fund investments of $3.0 million and an increase in interest and dividend income of $0.5 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. The effective tax rate increased from 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 18.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019. We recorded income tax expense of $15.2 million and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of (i) recording of a one-time tax benefit of $6.3 million with respect to unused 2018 foreign branch income tax credits under regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) recording of higher excess tax benefits related to stock awards of $7.2 million pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, (iii) lower tax expense of $3.1 million on account of impairment and restructuring charges recorded during the year December 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by (iv) higher tax exemptions/incentives and a lower tax rate for qualifying Indian subsidiaries due to a change in legislation during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income. Net income increased from $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $26.6 million and increase in other income, net of $3.5 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $11.8 million, higher interest expense of $6.4 million and lower foreign exchange gain, net of $1.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from 6.4% during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opening cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>203.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities </td> <td>(18.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(277.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities </td> <td>(89.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $402.8 million and $321.4 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $335.3 million and $250.4 million, respectively, is located in foreign jurisdictions that upon distribution may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We periodically evaluate opportunities regarding distribution to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to distribute, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions.\nOperating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $203.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting higher cash earnings along with lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $34.6 million year-over-year included the following:\n\u2022Increase in net income of $21.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of $33.6 million driven by lower operating expenses, offset by higher income tax expense of $10.4 million and lower other income, net of interest expense of $1.4 million.\n\u2022Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed additional cash flow of $43.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was a result of the higher collections of our accounts receivables and advance collections from certain customers. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 53 days as of December 31, 2020 from 59 days as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Decrease in accrued employee costs, accrued expenses and other liabilities contributed reduced cash flow of $40.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily because of additional cash flow of $30.9 million due to higher annual performance incentives and accrued expenses in 2019 compared to reduced cash flow of $9.4 million from lower accrued expenses in 2020.\n\u2022Other drivers increasing cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019 included: income tax expense, net of advances and deferred taxes, of $8.6 million, primarily due to higher income tax provisions and timing of payments; and changes in various current assets and other assets aggregating to $1.4 million, primarily due to lower upfront payment to customers.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting higher cash earnings along with lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $76.0 million year-over-year included the following:\n\u2022Increase in net income of $10.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of $26.6 million driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $11.8 million and lower interest and other income of $3.9 million.\n\u2022Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed additional cash flow of $14.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was a result of the growth in our revenues (including revenues from our SCIO acquisition in July 2018) and higher collections of our accounts receivable. As a result, our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 59 days in 2019 from 62 days in 2018.\n\u2022Increases in accrued employee costs, accrued expenses and other liabilities contributed additional cash flow of $30.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily resulting from higher annual performance incentives and other employee costs accruals of $15.6 million, higher accrued expenses of $8.2 million due to an increase in our cost base to support\nrevenue growth, and lower cash outflows in client liabilities of $4.3 million due to lower funds held on behalf of our clients.\n\u2022Other drivers increasing operating cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 included: income tax expense, net of advances and deferred taxes, of $9.6 million, primarily due to higher income tax provisions and timing of payments; and changes in various current assets and other assets aggregating to $10.3 million, primarily due to higher recovery of our receivables from statutory authorities in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInvesting Activities: Cash flows used for investing activities were $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly due to net redemption of investments of $23.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net purchase of investments of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by higher capital expenditures for purchase of long-lived assets, including investments in infrastructure, technology assets, software and product developments of $0.9 million and acquisition of additional stake in our equity affiliate of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash flows used for investing activities were $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $277.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is mainly due to higher cash used for the SCIO acquisition of $231.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by net higher purchase of investments of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to net purchase of investments of $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFinancing Activities: Cash flows used for financing activities were $89.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $93.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash flows used for financing activities was primarily due to net repayment of $10.9 million (net of proceeds) under our revolving Credit Facility (as described below in Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)-Credit Agreement\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net repayments of $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, higher proceeds received from exercise of stock options by $0.5 million, partially offset by higher purchases of treasury stock by $38.6 million under our share Repurchase Programs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash flows used for financing activities were $93.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $197.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flows provided from financing activities was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $240.4 million (net of repayment) under our revolving Credit Facility and Convertible Notes (as described below in Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)-Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net repayments (net of proceeds) of $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by lower purchases of treasury stock by $1.7 million under our share Repurchase Programs during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business by making investments, primarily related to new facilities and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements to build our facilities, digital capabilities and purchase telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations.\nWe incurred $42.2 million of capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of between $35.0 million to $40.0 million in 2021, primarily to meet our growth requirements, including additions to our facilities as well as investments in technology applications, product development, digital technology, advanced automation, robotics and infrastructure.\nIn connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries, we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to such assessment orders (see Note 26 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements herein for further details). We anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our smaller acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital needs. If we have significant growth through acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional financing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, management has taken certain precautionary measures, including: drawing $100.0 million from our line of credit under our Credit Agreement on March 12, 2020, the proceeds of which were available for working capital, general corporate or other purposes as needed, and which was repaid in full on April 20, 2020; and electing to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our 2019 Repurchase Program, and other cost reduction measures related to employee and vendor expenses and capital expenditure plans. The 2019\nRepurchase Program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and the management using its discretion has resumed share repurchases effective July 1, 2020, considering improved market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. However, there is no assurance that the impacts we have experienced to date, and any future impact we may experience, from COVID-19 will not have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, (the CARES Act\u201d) allows employers to defer the payment of the employer share of Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA\u201d) taxes for the period from April 1, 2020 and ending December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we deferred our contributions to FICA of $6.3 million under the CARES Act. The deferred amount will be payable as follows: (1) 50% of the deferred amount will be paid on December 31, 2021 and (2) the remaining 50% of the deferred amount will be paid on December 31, 2022.\nFinancing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)\nThe following tables summarizes our debt balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>214.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs* </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>Structured Payables </td> <td> </td> <td>Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs* </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Unamortized debt issuance costs for our revolving Credit Facility of $0.5 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, is presented under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 21, 2017, we and each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement with certain lenders, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with an option to increase the commitments by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain approvals and conditions as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also includes a letter of credit sub facility. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 21, 2022 and is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. On July 2, 2018, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to increase the commitments by $100.0 million thereby utilizing the entire revolver under the Credit Facility of $300.0 million to fund our July 2018 acquisition of SCIO.\nDepending on the type of borrowing, loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted LIBO rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0% to 0.75% per annum with respect to loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and\n1.00% to 1.75% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted LIBO rate. The revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee which is also tied to our total net leverage ratio, and ranges from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d under Risks Related to Our Indebtedness - We may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. We could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all.\u201d\nThe revolving Credit Facility carried an effective interest rate as shown below:-\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by all or substantially all of our assets and that of our material domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and related distributions, enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions and dispose of assets or subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant to not permit the interest coverage ratio or the total net leverage ratio, both as defined for the four consecutive quarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than 3.5 to 1.0 or more than 3.0 to 1.0, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants listed under the Credit Agreement.\nWe entered into a second amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, as amended, among the Company, as borrower, with certain lenders, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent to, among other things, permit the issuance by the Company of the Notes, and settlement upon maturity or conversion thereof, in accordance with the Investment Agreement, the indenture dated as of October 4, 2018 and the other documents entered into in connection therewith.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into an investment agreement (the Investment Agreement\u201d) with Orogen Echo LLC (the Purchaser\u201d), an affiliate of The Orogen Group LLC, relating to the issuance to the Purchaser of $150.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of 3.50% per annum Convertible Senior Notes due October 1, 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued on October 4, 2018. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 13.3333 shares of the common stock per one thousand dollar principal amount of the Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $75 per share). With certain exceptions, upon a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the Notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem the principal amount of the Notes, at its option, in whole but not in part, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on or after October 1, 2021, if the closing sale price of the common stock exceeds 150% of the then-current conversion price for 20 or more trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period preceding our exercise of this redemption right (including the trading day immediately prior to the date of the notice of redemption).We may elect to settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We presently intend and have the ability to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash. In 2018, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay $150.0 million of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nWe accounted for the liability and equity components of the Notes separately to reflect its non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The estimated fair value of the liability component at issuance of $133.1 million was determined using a discounted cash flow technique, which considered debt issuances with similar features of our debt, excluding the conversion feature. The resulting effective interest rate for the Notes was 5.75% per annum. The excess of the gross proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component totaling $16.9 million, was allocated to the conversion feature (equity component, recorded as additional paid-in capital) with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the Notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over a six-year period ending October 1, 2024 (the expected life of the liability component) using the effective interest method.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest expense and amortization of debt discount, on the Notes as below:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on the Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount on the Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of the Notes, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit to third parties primarily for facility leases. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million, each, that were not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. These are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>420.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Represents undiscounted operating lease liabilities payable over the lease term.\n(b) Represents estimated employee benefit payments under the Gratuity Plan.\n(c) Represents our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of our Notes of $150 million in cash and does not reflect any assumptions about our ability or intent to settle the Notes before their maturity.\n(d) Interest on borrowings is calculated based on the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020.\n(e) Excludes $0.9 million related to uncertain tax positions, since the extent of the amount and timing of payment is currently not reliably estimable or determinable.\nCertain units of our Indian subsidiaries were established as 100% Export-Oriented units under the Software Technology Parks of India ( STPI\u201d) or Special Economic Zone (\"SEZ\") scheme promulgated by the Government of India. These units are exempt from customs, central excise duties, and levies on imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares. We have undertaken to pay custom duties, service taxes, levies, and liquidated damages payable, if any, in respect of imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. We believe, however, that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions.\nOur operations centers in the Philippines are registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority ( PEZA\u201d). The registration provides us with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and local purchase of services and materials and requires that ExlService Philippines, Inc. to meet certain performance and investment criteria. We believe that these centers have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required criteria.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

By orchestrating our domain expertise, data, analytics and digital technology, we look deeper to design and manage agile, customer-centric operating models to improve global operations, drive profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, increase data-driven insights, and manage risk and compliance. We serve customers in multiple industries, including insurance, healthcare, banking and financial services, utilities, travel, transportation and logistics, media and retail, among others.\nWe operate in the business process management ( BPM\u201d) industry and we provide operations management and analytics services. Effective January 1, 2020, we made certain operational and structural changes to more closely integrate our businesses and to simplify our organizational structure. Since then, we have managed and reported financial information through our four strategic business units: Insurance, Healthcare, Analytics and Emerging Business, which reflects how management reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. In line with our strategy of vertical integration and focus on domain expertise, we integrated our Finance & Accounting and Consulting operating segments within each of the Insurance and Healthcare operating segments based on the respective industry-specific clients. Finance & Accounting and Consulting services provided to clients outside of those industries, are part of our Emerging Business\u201d segment. In addition, we integrated our former Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Banking and Financial Services, and Utilities operating segments under Emerging Business\u201d to further leverage and optimize the operating scale in providing operations management services.\nOur reportable segments effective January 1, 2020 are as follows:\n\u2022Insurance,\n\u2022Healthcare,\n\u2022Analytics, and\n\u2022Emerging Business\nIn conjunction with the new reporting structure, we recast our segment and goodwill disclosures for all prior periods presented to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.\nOur global delivery network, which includes highly trained industry and process specialists across the United States, Latin America, South Africa, Europe and Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), is a key asset. We have operations centers in\nIndia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Bulgaria, Colombia, South Africa, Romania and the Czech Republic.\nContinued Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially impact worldwide economic activity and levels of business confidence and has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. During the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on our business, however, in subsequent quarters, COVID-19 materially impacted us. Our customers, contractors, suppliers, and other partners were prevented from conducting business activities as usual, including due to the health and safety measures in response to COVID-19, such as shutdowns, which were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The disruption adversely affected our ability to provide our services and solutions and resulted in, among other things, significant loss of revenue, increased costs and the possibility of enhanced credit risk on our accounts receivable, which is reflected in our financial operating results. The continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected has disrupted the continuity of our provision of services to our customers and adversely impacted our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have a business continuity plan in place and have adapted delivery to a work from home model, while actively working to understand our clients' changing requirements, continuing to ensure data security, prioritizing critical processes, adjusting service levels and managing discretionary costs (such as travel costs) and fixed costs (such as non-critical personnel costs). While travel restrictions had a short-term impact on our ability to deliver our services in 2020, we have been working to reduce our reliance on travel by incorporating into our business model the ability to conduct business using virtual conferencing and collaboration tools. Our work from home delivery capability steadily improved throughout the year. We estimate that we are able to deliver over 95% of our clients' current requirements in a work from home model given the current lockdown restrictions in the locations in which we operate and certain clients not authorizing us to perform the remaining process work remotely due to its sensitive nature. In addition, we have also worked, and continue to work with national, state, and local authorities to comply with applicable rules and regulations related to COVID-19. There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world. Despite the efforts described above, there is a risk that if jurisdictions in which we operate reinstate prior restrictions, stagnate in their reopening processes, or implement new restrictions in response to new outbreaks or continued spread, our operations and business could be materially impacted.\nWe also took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on helping our employees. These actions included disseminating guidance and information to our employees, facilitating work from home, implementing best practices for employees while working from home, periodic CEO messaging, various programs aimed at employee wellness, including a global wellness program, enhanced leave for employees affected by COVID-19, enhanced awareness towards information security, and updated cyber security and data privacy policies, among others. We have implemented broad travel restrictions and largely moved to virtual-only events for the safety of our employees and our customers. We also implemented pandemic-specific protocols for our essential employees whose jobs require them to be on-site or with our customers by implementing additional safety measures at all of our facilities, including increased frequency in cleaning and disinfecting, and enhanced hygiene and social distancing practices.\nWe incurred additional costs in order to ensure the continuity of our operations and shift towards a work from home model. Such costs include purchase of desktops and laptops for our employees, software and internet connectivity devices, technology tools for productivity enhancement, accommodation, meal, overtime, transportation and regular sanitization and cleaning costs of our offices and facilities. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our work from home model, implement new information technology solutions and security measures to safeguard against information security risks and protect the health and safety of our employees as they gradually return to the office. We believe that these short-to-medium-term costs may benefit us in the long-term, as these steps have broadened our remote working\u201d capabilities, which we expect to become a permanent feature in our future delivery model, as well as our business continuity plans.\nIn response to certain anticipated impacts from COVID-19, we also implemented a series of temporary cost reduction measures to further preserve financial flexibility. These actions included the postponement of certain discretionary spending including travel and marketing expenses, reevaluating the pace of our capital expenditures, rationalizing certain of our real estate and facilities, deferring scheduled increases in base salaries, deferring non-critical hiring, temporarily reducing the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees among others. Some of these actions have been reversed as of December 31, 2020.\nWe also took certain precautionary measures to maintain financial flexibility during this time, including drawing $100.0 million from our line of credit under our Credit Agreement on March 12, 2020, the proceeds of which were available for\nworking capital, general corporate or other purposes as needed, and which was repaid in full on April 20, 2020. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, management elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under the 2019 Repurchase Program. We resumed share repurchases effective July 1, 2020, considering improved market conditions, our capital and liquidity needs and other factors.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow in fiscal year 2020 has been explained in the discussion below, however the full extent of the impact for the period beyond the fiscal year 2020 is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic and prevent or limit any reoccurrence; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when COVID-19 subsides. Due to the above circumstances and as described generally in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our financial results, including but not limited to net revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow and earnings per share, in future periods may differ materially from historical trends. We continue to monitor the implications of COVID-19 on our business, as well as our customers' and suppliers' businesses.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill quantitative impairment test for any potential impairment. We considered the effects of COVID-19 on our significant inputs used in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Based on the results, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and the goodwill was not impaired. However, there can be no assurances that goodwill will not be impaired in future periods. Estimating the fair value of goodwill requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. These estimates and judgments may not be within the control of us and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change in future periods.\nFor additional information and risks related to COVID-19, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $958.4 million compared to revenues of $991.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $32.9 million, or 3.3%.\nWe serve clients mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, with these two regions generating 85.0% and 9.3%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 82.5% and 11.4%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for 37.4% and 36.1% of our total revenues, respectively. Our revenue concentration with our top clients remains largely consistent year-over-year and we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our top ten clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur Business\nWe provide operations management and analytics services. We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by key industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the United States, Europe and Australia.\nOperations Management Services: We provide our clients with a range of operations management services from our Insurance, Healthcare and Emerging Business operating segments, which typically involve the transfer by our clients to EXL of certain of their business operations, such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage those operations on an ongoing basis. As part of this transfer, we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant business operations, implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client's customers. Each client contract has different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement. We also provide consulting services related to operations management that include industry-specific digital transformational services as well as cross-industry finance and accounting services as part of the Emerging Business operating segment.\nWe provide our services under contracts with our clients, which typically have terms of three or more years, with some being rolling contracts with no end dates. Typically, our clients can terminate these contracts with or without cause and with short notice periods. These contracts provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our operations management business. However, we have a long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of entering into definitive agreements with new clients. Similarly, new license sales and implementation projects for our technology service platforms and other software-based services have a long selling cycle, however ongoing annual maintenance and support contracts for existing arrangements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base.\nWe charge for our services using various pricing models like time-and-material pricing, full-time-equivalent pricing, transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing, subscription-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. Outcome-based pricing arrangements are examples of non-linear pricing models where clients link revenues from platforms and solutions and the services we provide to usage or savings rather than the efforts deployed to provide these services. We continue to observe a shift in the industry pricing models toward transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. We believe this trend will continue and we use such alternative pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a full-time-equivalent pricing model to a transaction-based or other alternative pricing model. These alternative pricing models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our gross margins.\nWe have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi-vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs. We believe that the trend toward multi-vendor relationships will continue. A multi-vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor, which can result in significantly reduced gross margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor. To the extent our large clients expand their use of multi-vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors, our gross margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients to meet competition.\nAnalytics: We help our clients unlock deep insights from data and create data driven solutions. Our analytics services focus on driving improved business outcomes for our customers by unlocking deep insights from data and create data driven solutions across all parts of our customers' business. We also provide care optimization and reimbursement optimization services, for our clients through our healthcare analytics solutions and services. We also offer integrated solutions to help our clients in cost containment by leveraging technology platforms, customizable and configurable analytics and expertise in healthcare reimbursements to help clients enhance their claim payment accuracy. Our teams deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics in the areas of customer acquisition and lifecycle management, risk underwriting and pricing, operational effectiveness, credit and operational risk monitoring and governance, regulatory reporting, payment integrity and care management and data management. We enhance, modernize and enrich structured and unstructured data and use a spectrum of advanced analytical tools and techniques, including our in-house Machine Learning ( ML\u201d) and Artificial Intelligence ( AI\u201d) capabilities to create insights and improve decision making for our clients. We actively cross-sell and, where appropriate, integrate our Analytics services with other operations management services as part of a comprehensive offering for our clients.\nWe anticipate that revenues from our analytics services will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base, both organically and through acquisitions.\nExpenses\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues primarily consists of:\n\u2022employee costs, which include salary, bonus and other compensation expenses; recruitment and training costs; employee insurance; transport; rewards and recognition for certain employees; and non-cash stock compensation expense; and\n\u2022costs relating to our facilities and communications network, which include telecommunication and IT costs; facilities and customer management support; operational expenses for our operations centers; rent expenses; and\n\u2022travel and other billable costs to our clients; and\n\u2022costs relating to our direct mail operations and other digital solutions.\nThe most significant components of our cost of revenues are salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation), recruitment, training, transport, meals, rewards and recognition and employee insurance. Salary levels, employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues. Salary increases for most of our operations personnel are generally awarded each year effective April 1. However, during 2020, in response to certain anticipated impacts from COVID-19, we implemented a series of temporary cost reduction measures including deferring the scheduled increases in base salaries of all eligible employees and temporarily reducing the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees. Some of these actions have been reversed as of December 31, 2020. We make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements. Although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated, a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher-than-expected number of unassigned employees, which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees, particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services, would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency, productivity and profit margins. In addition, cost of revenues also includes non-cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients.\nWe expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operating centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally. In particular, we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients and provide existing staff with additional skill sets. There is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients. As our existing competitors continue to grow, and as new competitors enter the market, we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase, with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our work from home model, invest in information technology solutions and security measures to safeguard against information security risks and costs to protect the health and safety of our employees as they gradually return to the office. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d under Risks Related to Our Business-Employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin\u201d and under Risks Related to the International Nature of Our Business-If more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize, our profitability may be adversely affected.\u201d However, a significant portion of our client contracts include inflation-based adjustments to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues.\nWe generally experience a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during the initial 12 to 18 months in a long-term BPM contract due to upfront investments in infrastructure, resource hiring and training during migration. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues improve as we scale up, achieve operational efficiencies and complete the migration.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nOur general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries and benefits (including stock based compensation) as well as costs related to recruitment, training and retention of senior management and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities, travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs. General and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees (which represent the costs of third party legal, tax, accounting and other advisors), investment in product development, digital technology, advanced automation and robotics, bad debt allowance and non-cash amortization of stock compensation expenses related to our issuance of equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect our G&A costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development, performance management and training programs.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits (including stock based compensation) and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel, sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation of our tangible assets, including network equipment, cabling, computers, office furniture and equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets. As we add new facilities and expand our existing operations centers, we expect that depreciation expense will increase, reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers, servers and other infrastructure. We expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges pertain to the write down of carrying values to fair values of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We perform our annual impairment test annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, for all our reporting units and intangible assets. Based on the results, if the carrying values of our reporting units exceeds their fair values, we record impairment charges to the extent that carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Such assets are required to be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of the assets is higher than the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets. The impairment amount to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value.\nForeign Exchange\nWe report our financial results in the U.S. dollar. However, a significant portion of our total revenues are earned in the U.K. pound sterling (8.3% and 10.2%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019), while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in Indian rupees (27.2% and 25.6%, respectively, of our total costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019) and the Philippine peso (11.5% and 7.9%, of our total costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019). The exchange rates among the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future as well. The results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso and the U.K. pound sterling appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 - Derivatives and Hedge Accounting to our consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.\u201d\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consist of interest on our borrowings under our credit facility and convertible senior notes, finance lease liabilities and notional interest implicit in the purchase of property and equipment.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gain/(loss) on sale, mark to market and dividend income on our investments in mutual funds, and interest on time deposits classified under Cash and cash equivalents\u201d, Short-term investments\u201d and Other assets\u201d, as applicable on our consolidated balance sheets. Other income, net also consists of changes in fair value of earn-out consideration, interest on refunds received from income tax authorities in India on completion of tax assessments and components of net periodic benefit cost such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gain or loss and profit or loss on disposal of long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Our tax expense and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations and the potential adverse outcome of tax examinations. Changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which may result from a decline in our profitability or changes in tax rates or legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense.\nDuring the year 2018, we made an election to change the tax status of most of our controlled foreign corporations ( CFC\u201d) to disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we no longer have undistributed earnings in connection with these CFCs. The Transition Tax resulted in previously taxed income ( PTI\u201d) which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency gains or losses upon repatriation. We periodically evaluate opportunities to repatriate PTI held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to repatriate such PTI, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions.\nIn 2019, the Government of India introduced a new tax regime for certain Indian companies by enacting the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019. The new tax regime is optional and provides for a lower tax rate for Indian companies, subject to certain conditions, which among other things includes not availing of specified exemptions or incentives. During the year 2019 and 2020, we elected this new tax regime for our Indian subsidiaries to obtain the benefit of a lower tax rate.\nWe also benefited from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for our operations centers established there over the last several years. The tax holiday expired for few of our centers in last few years and will expire for other centers by year 2022,\nwhich may lead to an increase in our overall tax rate. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in the Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate, which as of December 31, 2020 was 5.0% on gross income.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. We determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain at the time an estimate is made. These policies include revenue recognition, allowance for expected credit losses, business combinations, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, derivative instruments and hedging activity, borrowings, assumptions related to lease liabilities, ROU assets, lease cost, income taxes and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans. These accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below. Future events may not develop exactly as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when services are provided to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services provided.\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes discounts and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by providing services to a customer.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nSignificant judgments\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe sometimes enter into contracts with our clients which include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the client. Determining whether products and services are considered as distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately rather than as one performance obligation may require significant judgment. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations on relative standalone selling price basis.\nJudgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, it is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nVariable Consideration\nVariability in the transaction price arises primarily due to service level agreements and volume discounts.\nWe consider our experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration that should be recognized during a period.\nWe believe that the expected value method is most appropriate for determining the variable consideration since we have a large number of contracts with similar nature of transactions/services.\nType of Contracts Requiring Judgment\na.Revenues for our fixed-price contracts are recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. The use of this method requires significant judgment to estimate the cost required to complete the contracted scope of work, including\nassumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and resources engaged. We regularly monitor these estimates throughout the execution of the project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined. If a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project, such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified.\nb.Revenues from reimbursement optimization services having contingent fee arrangements are recognized by us at the point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon the actual collections made by our customers and net of any subsequent retraction claims. Based on guidance on variable consideration\u201d in Topic 606, we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue based upon such expected recoveries. Any adjustment required due to change in estimates are recorded in the period in which such change is identified.\nFor additional information, see Note 5 - Revenues, net to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nUnbilled Receivables\nUnbilled receivables represent revenues recognized for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date. Unbilled receivables also include revenues recognized from reimbursement optimization services where we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon and collectable only when the actual collections are made by our customers. Based on guidance on variable consideration\u201d in Topic 606, we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue and receivables based upon such expected recoveries. Accordingly, the amounts for which services have been performed and for which invoices have not been issued to customers on the balance sheet date, (i.e. unbilled receivables) are presented under accounts receivable.\nDeferred Revenue and contract fulfillment costs\nWe have contract liabilities (deferred revenue) consisting of advance billings and billing in excess of revenues recognized. Deferred revenue also includes the amount for which services have been rendered but other conditions of revenue recognition are not met, for example where we do not have an enforceable contract.\nFurther, we also defer revenues attributable to certain process transition activities, with respect to our customers where such activities do not represent separate performance obligations. Revenues related to such transition activities are classified under Deferred revenue\u201d and Other non-current liabilities\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are performed.\nCosts related to such transition activities are contract fulfillment costs, and thereby classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers, under Cost of revenues\u201d in our consolidated statements of income.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nDirect and incremental costs incurred for acquiring contracts, such as sales commissions are contract acquisition costs and thereby classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers and recorded under Selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nUpfront Payment Made to Customers\nUpfront payments in nature of deal signing discount or deal signing bonuses made to customers are contract assets and classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit and are recorded as an adjustment to transaction price and reduced from revenues.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\nWe record accounts receivable net of allowances for expected credit losses. Allowances for credit losses are established through the evaluation of aging of accounts receivables, prior collection experience, current market conditions, forecasts about future economic conditions, clients' financial condition and the amount of accounts receivable in dispute to estimate the collectability of these accounts receivable.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations\u201d. The guidance requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in allocation of the purchase price in determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets and contingent consideration and allocation of purchase price over such assets and liabilities on the acquisition date. The significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on, among other things, anticipated growth rates and customer attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the reporting units to which it is assigned. We undertake studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and allocate purchase consideration to assets and liabilities, including property and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangibles. We examine the carrying value of the goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. We also assesses any potential goodwill impairment for our reporting units immediately prior to any segment changes and reallocate goodwill basis the new reporting units.\nThe goodwill quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of the income approach, using discounted cash flow analysis ( DCF model\u201d), and also the market approach, using market multiples for reporting units whereby the fair value is not substantially in excess of carrying value. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The discount rate is mainly based on judgment of the specific risk inherent within each reporting unit. The variables within the discount rate, many of which are outside of our control, provide us best estimate of all assumptions applied within the DCF model. Discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations range from 10.4% to 12.0%. We also use the Market approach\u201d to corroborate the results of the income approach for some of our reporting units. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit and comparable market transactions. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nDetermining fair value requires the use of estimates and exercise of significant judgment, including assumptions about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market multiples of revenues and earnings and comparable market transactions. These estimates and judgements may not be within our control and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the estimates and judgments described above could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized, in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of discounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The estimate of discounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, risk-free rates, market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nStock-based Compensation\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC No. 718\u201d), cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised and the expected volatility of our stock.\nWe also grant performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs\u201d) to executive officers and other specified employees. Generally the grants provide that 50% of the PRSUs cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on an aggregated revenue target ( PUs\u201d) for a three-year period. The remaining 50% vest based on a market condition ( MUs\u201d) that is contingent on EXL meeting or exceeding the total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies specified under the program, measured over a three-year performance period. The award recipient may earn up to 200% of the PRSUs granted based on the actual achievements of both targets. However, the features of our equity incentive compensation program are subject to change by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\nThe fair value of each PU is determined based on the market price of one share of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value for the MUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates a range of possible future stock prices and estimates the probabilities of the potential payouts. The Monte Carlo simulation model also involves the use of additional key assumptions, including dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. We periodically assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and update our estimates as required. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn the normal course of business, we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into various foreign currency exchange forward contracts, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.\nWe hedge forecasted transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, until the hedged transactions occurs. The resultant foreign exchange gain/(loss) upon settlement of these cash flow hedges is recorded along with the underlying hedged item in the same line in our consolidated statements of income as either part of Cost of revenues\u201d, General and administrative expenses\u201d, Selling and marketing expenses\u201d, or Depreciation and amortization expense\u201d, as applicable.\nWe also use derivative instruments consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts to economically hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. These derivatives do not qualify as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain/(loss).\nWe determine the fair value of our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts. The quotes are taken primarily from independent sources, including highly rated financial institutions.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness of cash flow hedges at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period, any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings.\nBorrowings\nWe account for convertible notes in accordance with the guidelines established by the ASC No. 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. We separate the convertible notes into liability and equity components. The Beneficial Conversion Feature (\"BCF\") of a convertible note, which is the equity component and recorded as additional paid-in capital, is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature of certain notes payable that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or in-the-money when issued. We record a BCF related to any issuance of convertible notes.\nIf a convertible note is within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections contains embedded features other than the embedded conversion option, the guidance in ASC No. 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging - Embedded Derivatives ( ASC 815-15\u201d), is applied to determine if any of those features must be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument.\nThe estimated fair value of the liability component at issuance is determined using a discounted cash flow technique, which considers debt issuances with similar features of our convertible notes, excluding the conversion feature. The excess of the gross proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component is allocated to the BCF, which is credited to additional paid-in-capital with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the convertible notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the convertible notes using the effective interest method.\nDirect, incremental finance costs related to the convertible notes are amortized over the term instrument through charges to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nWe may elect to settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. We presently intend and have the ability to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income tax using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved. Deferred tax assets are recognized in full, subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. With respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday, deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday.\nWe also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required. A reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is probable and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such reserves are based on estimates and, consequently, are subject to changing facts and circumstances, including the progress of ongoing audits, changes in case law and the passage of new legislation. We believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover any current tax assessments.\nDuring the year 2018, we made an election to change the tax status of most of our controlled foreign corporations ( CFC\u201d) to disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we no longer have undistributed earnings in connection with these CFCs. The Transition Tax resulted in previously taxed income ( PTI\u201d) which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency gains or losses upon repatriation. We periodically evaluate opportunities to repatriate PTI held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to repatriate such PTI, we may have to accrue additional taxes which will be recorded in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. See Note 22 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nWe employ a two-step process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining, based on the technical merits, that the position will, more likely than not, be sustained upon examination. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe record contributions to defined contribution plans in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which services are rendered by the covered employees. Current service costs for defined benefit plans are recognized in the period to which they relate. The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated annually by using the projected unit credit method and various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, mortality, expected return on assets, expected increase in the compensation rates and attrition rates. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually. If actual results differ\nsignificantly from our estimates, current service costs for defined benefit plans and our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe include the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the respective employees during the period. The interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/loss, are included in - Other income, net\u201d. See Note 20 - Employee Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nWe recognize the liabilities for compensated absences dependent on whether the obligation is attributable to employee services already rendered, relates to rights that vest or accumulate and payment is probable and estimable.\nLeases\nWe account for a lease at the inception of the contract. Operating leases are recorded in Operating lease right-of-use assets\u201d, Current portion of operating lease liabilities\u201d and Operating lease liabilities, less current portion\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are recorded in Property and equipment, net\u201d, and the current and non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are presented within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d and Other non-current liabilities,\u201d respectively in our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease arrangement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate at commencement date by adjusting the benchmark reference rates, applicable to the respective geographies where the leases are entered, with appropriate financing spreads and lease specific adjustments for the effects of collateral.\nLease terms includes our assessment for the effects of options to extend or terminate the lease. We consider the extension option as part of our lease term for those lease arrangements where we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.\nWe account for lease-related concessions to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 on lessees in accordance with guidance in Topic 842, Leases, to determine, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether the concession provided by lessor should be accounted for as a lease modification.\nWe account for a modification as a separate contract when it grants an additional right of use not included in the original lease and the increase is commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use, adjusted for the circumstances of the particular contract. Modifications which are not accounted for as a separate contract are reassessed as of the effective date of the modification based on its modified terms and conditions and the facts and circumstances as of that date. The lease liability is remeasured to reflect changes to the remaining lease payments and discount rates and we recognize the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. However, if the carrying amount of the ROU assets is reduced to zero as a result of modification, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nContingencies\nLoss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, we do not record a liability, but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Significant judgment is required in the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable, both. Our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table

The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, which was primarily related to clients adapting to the shift in our delivery capabilities from a physical to a virtual, work-from-home operating environment as well as economic uncertainty leading to lower volumes from some existing clients and causing delays in the execution and implementation of new client contracts, which impacted growth.\nRevenue decline in Insurance of $4.6 million was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by expansion of business from certain existing clients aggregating to $3.4 million and a decline in revenues of $1.3 million attributable to the depreciation of the Indian rupee and South African ZAR against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Insurance revenues were 35.7% and 34.9% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Healthcare of $3.7 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $16.2 million, partially offset by our December 2019 wind-down of Health Integrated business revenues of $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Healthcare revenues were 10.6% and 9.8% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue decline in Emerging Business of $37.4 million was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19 and ramp-down of certain client contracts aggregating to $35.6 million, and a decline of $1.8 million attributable to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Emerging Business revenues were 15.9% and 19.2% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Analytics of $5.4 million was attributable to our recurring and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients, partially offset by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19 aggregating to $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Analytics revenues were 37.8% and 36.0% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin: The following table sets forth cost of revenues and gross margin of our reportable segments.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Cost of Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Margin </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nchange </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>73.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emerging Business </td> <td>89.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analytics </td> <td>229.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of revenues was $623.9 million compared to $655.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 4.8%. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 34.9% compared to 33.9% for year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 100 basis points (\"bps\").\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Insurance of $6.7 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $4.0 million, lower travel costs of $4.4 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.2 million. This was partially offset by higher infrastructure and technology costs of $3.3 million, primarily related to the work from home enablement and other operating costs of $0.6 million. Gross margin in Insurance increased by 110 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to expansion in margin in certain existing clients, partially offset by COVID-19 related incremental expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $4.0 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $3.1 million, lower travel costs of $0.5 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $0.4 million. Gross margin in Healthcare increased by 690 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower margin in the Heath Integrated business during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by COVID-19 related incremental expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $19.1 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $14.2 million, lower infrastructure and technology costs of $2.5 million, lower travel costs of $1.9 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher other operating costs of $0.8 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business decreased by 150 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower revenues and COVID-19 related incremental expenses.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Analytics of $1.8 million was primarily due to lower other operating costs of $6.7 million, lower travel costs of $4.6 million, foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.2 million and lower infrastructure costs of $1.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related costs of $10.5 million and technology costs of $2.3 million. Gross margin in Analytics increased by 140 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher revenues and expansion in margin in certain existing clients.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nchange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing expenses </td> <td>60.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in SG&A expenses of $24.7 million was primarily due to COVID-19 cost reduction measures, including the temporary reduction of the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees.

The increase in depreciation expense of $5.7 million was primarily due to depreciation related to our investments in new operating centers, internally developed software and accelerated depreciation resulting from a reduction in useful lives related to several operating centers, due to the impact of COVID-19.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and restructuring charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.1 million and impairment charges of $3.6 million in connection with the wind-down of our Health Integrated business.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations increased by $33.6 million, or 43.9%, from $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower SG&A expenses of $24.7 million and impairment and restructuring charges of $8.7 million incurred in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations increased from 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss). Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to the movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling, the Philippine peso, and the South African ZAR during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 70.36 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 74.07 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 1.28 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.29 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso decreased from 51.57 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 49.49 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the South African ZAR increased from 14.43 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 16.51 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to repayments of borrowings leading to lower outstanding borrowings and lower effective interest rates of 2.3% under our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.0% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther Income, net..\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nchange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale and mark-to-market of mutual funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Others, net </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income, net decreased by $4.4 million, from $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower return on mutual fund investments of $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and recognition of other income of $0.8 million related to our Health Integrated business during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense. The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 22.2% during the year ended December 31, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $25.6 million and $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of (i) higher profit during the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) recording of a one-time tax expense of $1.3 million due to electing a new tax regime for two of our Indian subsidiaries which provides for a lower tax rate on earnings in exchange for foregoing certain tax credits during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $1.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income. Net income increased from $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $33.6 million, lower interest expense of $2.4 million and higher foreign exchange gain, net of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $10.4 million and decrease in other income, net of $4.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues.\nThe following table summarizes our revenues by reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>346.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emerging Business </td> <td>190.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analytics </td> <td>357.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>991.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>883.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $991.3 million, up $108.2 million, or 12.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue growth in Insurance of $35.2 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $38.6 million. This was partially offset by $3.4 million mainly attributable to the depreciation of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, U.K. pound sterling and South African ZAR against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Insurance revenues were 34.9% and 35.2% of our total revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Healthcare of $7.7 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $12.9 million, partially offset by lower revenues from our Health Integrated business of $5.2 million. Healthcare revenues were 9.8% and 10.2% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nRevenue decline in Emerging Business of $6.7 million was primarily driven by lower revenues from project based engagements and lower revenues from existing clients of $4.7 million. Further decline of $2.0 million was mainly due to the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Emerging Business revenues were 19.2% and 22.3% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Analytics of $72.0 million was primarily driven by our acquisition of SCIOinspire Holdings Inc. ( SCIO\u201d), a health analytics solution and services company, in July 2018 and increase in revenues from our recurring and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients. This was partially offset by $1.0 million attributable to the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling and Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Analytics revenues were 36.0% and 32.3% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin: The following table sets forth cost of revenues and gross margin of our reportable segments.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Cost of Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Margin </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>77.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emerging Business </td> <td>108.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analytics </td> <td>231.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>584.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of revenues was $655.5 million compared to $584.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $70.7 million, or 12.1%. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 33.9% compared to 33.8% for year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 10 bps.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Insurance of $26.8 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $24.3 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, increase in technology cost of $3.4 million and increase in infrastructure and travel cost of $2.9 million. This was partially offset by lower other operating costs of $1.1 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.7 million. Gross margin in Insurance decreased by 80 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher operating expenses.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $6.7 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $7.3 million and higher other operating costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.0 million. Gross margin in Healthcare decreased by 70 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher operating expenses associated with the initiation of services for new and existing clients.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $9.4 million was primarily due to decrease in employee-related costs of $4.2 million, lower infrastructure and travel cost of $3.2 million, lower other operating costs of $0.4 million, and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.6 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business increased by 280 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to expansion in margin in certain new and existing clients.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Analytics of $46.6 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $42.7 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, including incremental cost related to our acquisition of SCIO in July 2018. The remaining increase was attributable to other operating costs of $5.8 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.9 million.

The increase in intangibles amortization expense of $1.2 million was primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with our SCIO acquisition in July 2018, partially offset by the impact of amortization of intangibles related to our Health Integrated acquisition, which were impaired during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and restructuring charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenues </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.1 million and impairment charges of $3.6 million in connection with the wind down of Health Integrated business within our Healthcare operating segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $20.1 million to write down the carrying value of goodwill of $14.2 million and intangible assets of $5.9 million to their fair values related to our Health Integrated business. See Note 10 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 24 - Impairment and Restructuring Charges to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations increased by $26.6 million, or 53.5%, from $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations increased from 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss). Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 68.48 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 70.36 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.33 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 1.28 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso decreased from 52.69 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 51.57 during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the net foreign exchange gain of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increase in average borrowings on account of issuance of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2018 and higher effective interest rates under our Credit Facility.\nOther Income, net\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale and mark-to-market of mutual funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Others, net </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income, net increased by $3.5 million, from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a higher return on mutual fund investments of $3.0 million and an increase in interest and dividend income of $0.5 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. The effective tax rate increased from 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 18.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019. We recorded income tax expense of $15.2 million and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of (i) recording of a one-time tax benefit of $6.3 million with respect to unused 2018 foreign branch income tax credits under regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) recording of higher excess tax benefits related to stock awards of $7.2 million pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, (iii) lower tax expense of $3.1 million on account of impairment and restructuring charges recorded during the year December 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by (iv) higher tax exemptions/incentives and a lower tax rate for qualifying Indian subsidiaries due to a change in legislation during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income. Net income increased from $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $26.6 million and increase in other income, net of $3.5 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $11.8 million, higher interest expense of $6.4 million and lower foreign exchange gain, net of $1.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from 6.4% during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opening cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>203.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities </td> <td>(18.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(277.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities </td> <td>(89.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $402.8 million and $321.4 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $335.3 million and $250.4 million, respectively, is located in foreign jurisdictions that upon distribution may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We periodically evaluate opportunities regarding distribution to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to distribute, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions.\nOperating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $203.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting higher cash earnings along with lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $34.6 million year-over-year included the following:\n\u2022Increase in net income of $21.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of $33.6 million driven by lower operating expenses, offset by higher income tax expense of $10.4 million and lower other income, net of interest expense of $1.4 million.\n\u2022Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed additional cash flow of $43.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was a result of the higher collections of our accounts receivables and advance collections from certain customers. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 53 days as of December 31, 2020 from 59 days as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Decrease in accrued employee costs, accrued expenses and other liabilities contributed reduced cash flow of $40.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily because of additional cash flow of $30.9 million due to higher annual performance incentives and accrued expenses in 2019 compared to reduced cash flow of $9.4 million from lower accrued expenses in 2020.\n\u2022Other drivers increasing cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019 included: income tax expense, net of advances and deferred taxes, of $8.6 million, primarily due to higher income tax provisions and timing of payments; and changes in various current assets and other assets aggregating to $1.4 million, primarily due to lower upfront payment to customers.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting higher cash earnings along with lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $76.0 million year-over-year included the following:\n\u2022Increase in net income of $10.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of $26.6 million driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $11.8 million and lower interest and other income of $3.9 million.\n\u2022Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed additional cash flow of $14.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was a result of the growth in our revenues (including revenues from our SCIO acquisition in July 2018) and higher collections of our accounts receivable. As a result, our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 59 days in 2019 from 62 days in 2018.\n\u2022Increases in accrued employee costs, accrued expenses and other liabilities contributed additional cash flow of $30.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily resulting from higher annual performance incentives and other employee costs accruals of $15.6 million, higher accrued expenses of $8.2 million due to an increase in our cost base to support\nrevenue growth, and lower cash outflows in client liabilities of $4.3 million due to lower funds held on behalf of our clients.\n\u2022Other drivers increasing operating cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 included: income tax expense, net of advances and deferred taxes, of $9.6 million, primarily due to higher income tax provisions and timing of payments; and changes in various current assets and other assets aggregating to $10.3 million, primarily due to higher recovery of our receivables from statutory authorities in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInvesting Activities: Cash flows used for investing activities were $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly due to net redemption of investments of $23.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net purchase of investments of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by higher capital expenditures for purchase of long-lived assets, including investments in infrastructure, technology assets, software and product developments of $0.9 million and acquisition of additional stake in our equity affiliate of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash flows used for investing activities were $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $277.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is mainly due to higher cash used for the SCIO acquisition of $231.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by net higher purchase of investments of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to net purchase of investments of $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFinancing Activities: Cash flows used for financing activities were $89.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $93.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash flows used for financing activities was primarily due to net repayment of $10.9 million (net of proceeds) under our revolving Credit Facility (as described below in Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)-Credit Agreement\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net repayments of $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, higher proceeds received from exercise of stock options by $0.5 million, partially offset by higher purchases of treasury stock by $38.6 million under our share Repurchase Programs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash flows used for financing activities were $93.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $197.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flows provided from financing activities was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $240.4 million (net of repayment) under our revolving Credit Facility and Convertible Notes (as described below in Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)-Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net repayments (net of proceeds) of $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by lower purchases of treasury stock by $1.7 million under our share Repurchase Programs during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business by making investments, primarily related to new facilities and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements to build our facilities, digital capabilities and purchase telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations.\nWe incurred $42.2 million of capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of between $35.0 million to $40.0 million in 2021, primarily to meet our growth requirements, including additions to our facilities as well as investments in technology applications, product development, digital technology, advanced automation, robotics and infrastructure.\nIn connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries, we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to such assessment orders (see Note 26 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements herein for further details). We anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our smaller acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital needs. If we have significant growth through acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional financing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, management has taken certain precautionary measures, including: drawing $100.0 million from our line of credit under our Credit Agreement on March 12, 2020, the proceeds of which were available for working capital, general corporate or other purposes as needed, and which was repaid in full on April 20, 2020; and electing to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our 2019 Repurchase Program, and other cost reduction measures related to employee and vendor expenses and capital expenditure plans. The 2019\nRepurchase Program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and the management using its discretion has resumed share repurchases effective July 1, 2020, considering improved market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. However, there is no assurance that the impacts we have experienced to date, and any future impact we may experience, from COVID-19 will not have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, (the CARES Act\u201d) allows employers to defer the payment of the employer share of Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA\u201d) taxes for the period from April 1, 2020 and ending December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we deferred our contributions to FICA of $6.3 million under the CARES Act. The deferred amount will be payable as follows: (1) 50% of the deferred amount will be paid on December 31, 2021 and (2) the remaining 50% of the deferred amount will be paid on December 31, 2022.\nFinancing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)\nThe following tables summarizes our debt balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>214.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs* </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>Structured Payables </td> <td> </td> <td>Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs* </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Unamortized debt issuance costs for our revolving Credit Facility of $0.5 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, is presented under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 21, 2017, we and each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement with certain lenders, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with an option to increase the commitments by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain approvals and conditions as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also includes a letter of credit sub facility. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 21, 2022 and is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. On July 2, 2018, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to increase the commitments by $100.0 million thereby utilizing the entire revolver under the Credit Facility of $300.0 million to fund our July 2018 acquisition of SCIO.\nDepending on the type of borrowing, loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted LIBO rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0% to 0.75% per annum with respect to loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and\n1.00% to 1.75% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted LIBO rate. The revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee which is also tied to our total net leverage ratio, and ranges from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d under Risks Related to Our Indebtedness - We may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. We could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all.\u201d\nThe revolving Credit Facility carried an effective interest rate as shown below:-\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by all or substantially all of our assets and that of our material domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and related distributions, enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions and dispose of assets or subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant to not permit the interest coverage ratio or the total net leverage ratio, both as defined for the four consecutive quarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than 3.5 to 1.0 or more than 3.0 to 1.0, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants listed under the Credit Agreement.\nWe entered into a second amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, as amended, among the Company, as borrower, with certain lenders, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent to, among other things, permit the issuance by the Company of the Notes, and settlement upon maturity or conversion thereof, in accordance with the Investment Agreement, the indenture dated as of October 4, 2018 and the other documents entered into in connection therewith.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into an investment agreement (the Investment Agreement\u201d) with Orogen Echo LLC (the Purchaser\u201d), an affiliate of The Orogen Group LLC, relating to the issuance to the Purchaser of $150.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of 3.50% per annum Convertible Senior Notes due October 1, 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued on October 4, 2018. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 13.3333 shares of the common stock per one thousand dollar principal amount of the Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $75 per share). With certain exceptions, upon a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the Notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem the principal amount of the Notes, at its option, in whole but not in part, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on or after October 1, 2021, if the closing sale price of the common stock exceeds 150% of the then-current conversion price for 20 or more trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period preceding our exercise of this redemption right (including the trading day immediately prior to the date of the notice of redemption).We may elect to settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We presently intend and have the ability to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash. In 2018, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay $150.0 million of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nWe accounted for the liability and equity components of the Notes separately to reflect its non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The estimated fair value of the liability component at issuance of $133.1 million was determined using a discounted cash flow technique, which considered debt issuances with similar features of our debt, excluding the conversion feature. The resulting effective interest rate for the Notes was 5.75% per annum. The excess of the gross proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component totaling $16.9 million, was allocated to the conversion feature (equity component, recorded as additional paid-in capital) with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the Notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over a six-year period ending October 1, 2024 (the expected life of the liability component) using the effective interest method.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest expense and amortization of debt discount, on the Notes as below:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on the Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount on the Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of the Notes, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit to third parties primarily for facility leases. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million, each, that were not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. These are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>420.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Represents undiscounted operating lease liabilities payable over the lease term.\n(b) Represents estimated employee benefit payments under the Gratuity Plan.\n(c) Represents our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of our Notes of $150 million in cash and does not reflect any assumptions about our ability or intent to settle the Notes before their maturity.\n(d) Interest on borrowings is calculated based on the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020.\n(e) Excludes $0.9 million related to uncertain tax positions, since the extent of the amount and timing of payment is currently not reliably estimable or determinable.\nCertain units of our Indian subsidiaries were established as 100% Export-Oriented units under the Software Technology Parks of India ( STPI\u201d) or Special Economic Zone (\"SEZ\") scheme promulgated by the Government of India. These units are exempt from customs, central excise duties, and levies on imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares. We have undertaken to pay custom duties, service taxes, levies, and liquidated damages payable, if any, in respect of imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. We believe, however, that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions.\nOur operations centers in the Philippines are registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority ( PEZA\u201d). The registration provides us with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and local purchase of services and materials and requires that ExlService Philippines, Inc. to meet certain performance and investment criteria. We believe that these centers have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required criteria.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

These and other risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or elsewhere, speak only as of the date on which they were made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us.

By orchestrating our domain expertise, data, analytics and digital technology, we look deeper to design and manage agile, customer-centric operating models to improve global operations, drive profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, increase data-driven insights, and manage risk and compliance. We serve customers in multiple industries, including insurance, healthcare, banking and financial services, utilities, travel, transportation and logistics, media and retail, among others.\nWe operate in the business process management ( BPM\u201d) industry and we provide operations management and analytics services. Effective January 1, 2020, we made certain operational and structural changes to more closely integrate our businesses and to simplify our organizational structure. Since then, we have managed and reported financial information through our four strategic business units: Insurance, Healthcare, Analytics and Emerging Business, which reflects how management reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. In line with our strategy of vertical integration and focus on domain expertise, we integrated our Finance & Accounting and Consulting operating segments within each of the Insurance and Healthcare operating segments based on the respective industry-specific clients. Finance & Accounting and Consulting services provided to clients outside of those industries, are part of our Emerging Business\u201d segment. In addition, we integrated our former Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Banking and Financial Services, and Utilities operating segments under Emerging Business\u201d to further leverage and optimize the operating scale in providing operations management services.\nOur reportable segments effective January 1, 2020 are as follows:\n\u2022Insurance,\n\u2022Healthcare,\n\u2022Analytics, and\n\u2022Emerging Business\nIn conjunction with the new reporting structure, we recast our segment and goodwill disclosures for all prior periods presented to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.\nOur global delivery network, which includes highly trained industry and process specialists across the United States, Latin America, South Africa, Europe and Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), is a key asset. We have operations centers in\nIndia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Bulgaria, Colombia, South Africa, Romania and the Czech Republic.\nContinued Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially impact worldwide economic activity and levels of business confidence and has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. During the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on our business, however, in subsequent quarters, COVID-19 materially impacted us. Our customers, contractors, suppliers, and other partners were prevented from conducting business activities as usual, including due to the health and safety measures in response to COVID-19, such as shutdowns, which were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The disruption adversely affected our ability to provide our services and solutions and resulted in, among other things, significant loss of revenue, increased costs and the possibility of enhanced credit risk on our accounts receivable, which is reflected in our financial operating results. The continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected has disrupted the continuity of our provision of services to our customers and adversely impacted our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have a business continuity plan in place and have adapted delivery to a work from home model, while actively working to understand our clients' changing requirements, continuing to ensure data security, prioritizing critical processes, adjusting service levels and managing discretionary costs (such as travel costs) and fixed costs (such as non-critical personnel costs). While travel restrictions had a short-term impact on our ability to deliver our services in 2020, we have been working to reduce our reliance on travel by incorporating into our business model the ability to conduct business using virtual conferencing and collaboration tools. Our work from home delivery capability steadily improved throughout the year. We estimate that we are able to deliver over 95% of our clients' current requirements in a work from home model given the current lockdown restrictions in the locations in which we operate and certain clients not authorizing us to perform the remaining process work remotely due to its sensitive nature. In addition, we have also worked, and continue to work with national, state, and local authorities to comply with applicable rules and regulations related to COVID-19. There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world. Despite the efforts described above, there is a risk that if jurisdictions in which we operate reinstate prior restrictions, stagnate in their reopening processes, or implement new restrictions in response to new outbreaks or continued spread, our operations and business could be materially impacted.\nWe also took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on helping our employees. These actions included disseminating guidance and information to our employees, facilitating work from home, implementing best practices for employees while working from home, periodic CEO messaging, various programs aimed at employee wellness, including a global wellness program, enhanced leave for employees affected by COVID-19, enhanced awareness towards information security, and updated cyber security and data privacy policies, among others. We have implemented broad travel restrictions and largely moved to virtual-only events for the safety of our employees and our customers. We also implemented pandemic-specific protocols for our essential employees whose jobs require them to be on-site or with our customers by implementing additional safety measures at all of our facilities, including increased frequency in cleaning and disinfecting, and enhanced hygiene and social distancing practices.\nWe incurred additional costs in order to ensure the continuity of our operations and shift towards a work from home model. Such costs include purchase of desktops and laptops for our employees, software and internet connectivity devices, technology tools for productivity enhancement, accommodation, meal, overtime, transportation and regular sanitization and cleaning costs of our offices and facilities. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our work from home model, implement new information technology solutions and security measures to safeguard against information security risks and protect the health and safety of our employees as they gradually return to the office. We believe that these short-to-medium-term costs may benefit us in the long-term, as these steps have broadened our remote working\u201d capabilities, which we expect to become a permanent feature in our future delivery model, as well as our business continuity plans.\nIn response to certain anticipated impacts from COVID-19, we also implemented a series of temporary cost reduction measures to further preserve financial flexibility. These actions included the postponement of certain discretionary spending including travel and marketing expenses, reevaluating the pace of our capital expenditures, rationalizing certain of our real estate and facilities, deferring scheduled increases in base salaries, deferring non-critical hiring, temporarily reducing the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees among others. Some of these actions have been reversed as of December 31, 2020.\nWe also took certain precautionary measures to maintain financial flexibility during this time, including drawing $100.0 million from our line of credit under our Credit Agreement on March 12, 2020, the proceeds of which were available for\nworking capital, general corporate or other purposes as needed, and which was repaid in full on April 20, 2020. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, management elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under the 2019 Repurchase Program. We resumed share repurchases effective July 1, 2020, considering improved market conditions, our capital and liquidity needs and other factors.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow in fiscal year 2020 has been explained in the discussion below, however the full extent of the impact for the period beyond the fiscal year 2020 is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic and prevent or limit any reoccurrence; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when COVID-19 subsides. Due to the above circumstances and as described generally in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our financial results, including but not limited to net revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow and earnings per share, in future periods may differ materially from historical trends. We continue to monitor the implications of COVID-19 on our business, as well as our customers' and suppliers' businesses.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill quantitative impairment test for any potential impairment. We considered the effects of COVID-19 on our significant inputs used in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Based on the results, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and the goodwill was not impaired. However, there can be no assurances that goodwill will not be impaired in future periods. Estimating the fair value of goodwill requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. These estimates and judgments may not be within the control of us and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change in future periods.\nFor additional information and risks related to COVID-19, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $958.4 million compared to revenues of $991.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $32.9 million, or 3.3%.\nWe serve clients mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, with these two regions generating 85.0% and 9.3%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 82.5% and 11.4%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for 37.4% and 36.1% of our total revenues, respectively. Our revenue concentration with our top clients remains largely consistent year-over-year and we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our top ten clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur Business\nWe provide operations management and analytics services. We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by key industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the United States, Europe and Australia.\nOperations Management Services: We provide our clients with a range of operations management services from our Insurance, Healthcare and Emerging Business operating segments, which typically involve the transfer by our clients to EXL of certain of their business operations, such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage those operations on an ongoing basis. As part of this transfer, we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant business operations, implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client's customers. Each client contract has different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement. We also provide consulting services related to operations management that include industry-specific digital transformational services as well as cross-industry finance and accounting services as part of the Emerging Business operating segment.\nWe provide our services under contracts with our clients, which typically have terms of three or more years, with some being rolling contracts with no end dates. Typically, our clients can terminate these contracts with or without cause and with short notice periods. These contracts provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our operations management business. However, we have a long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of entering into definitive agreements with new clients. Similarly, new license sales and implementation projects for our technology service platforms and other software-based services have a long selling cycle, however ongoing annual maintenance and support contracts for existing arrangements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base.\nWe charge for our services using various pricing models like time-and-material pricing, full-time-equivalent pricing, transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing, subscription-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. Outcome-based pricing arrangements are examples of non-linear pricing models where clients link revenues from platforms and solutions and the services we provide to usage or savings rather than the efforts deployed to provide these services. We continue to observe a shift in the industry pricing models toward transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. We believe this trend will continue and we use such alternative pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a full-time-equivalent pricing model to a transaction-based or other alternative pricing model. These alternative pricing models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our gross margins.\nWe have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi-vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs. We believe that the trend toward multi-vendor relationships will continue. A multi-vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor, which can result in significantly reduced gross margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor. To the extent our large clients expand their use of multi-vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors, our gross margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients to meet competition.\nAnalytics: We help our clients unlock deep insights from data and create data driven solutions. Our analytics services focus on driving improved business outcomes for our customers by unlocking deep insights from data and create data driven solutions across all parts of our customers' business. We also provide care optimization and reimbursement optimization services, for our clients through our healthcare analytics solutions and services. We also offer integrated solutions to help our clients in cost containment by leveraging technology platforms, customizable and configurable analytics and expertise in healthcare reimbursements to help clients enhance their claim payment accuracy. Our teams deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics in the areas of customer acquisition and lifecycle management, risk underwriting and pricing, operational effectiveness, credit and operational risk monitoring and governance, regulatory reporting, payment integrity and care management and data management. We enhance, modernize and enrich structured and unstructured data and use a spectrum of advanced analytical tools and techniques, including our in-house Machine Learning ( ML\u201d) and Artificial Intelligence ( AI\u201d) capabilities to create insights and improve decision making for our clients. We actively cross-sell and, where appropriate, integrate our Analytics services with other operations management services as part of a comprehensive offering for our clients.\nWe anticipate that revenues from our analytics services will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base, both organically and through acquisitions.\nExpenses\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues primarily consists of:\n\u2022employee costs, which include salary, bonus and other compensation expenses; recruitment and training costs; employee insurance; transport; rewards and recognition for certain employees; and non-cash stock compensation expense; and\n\u2022costs relating to our facilities and communications network, which include telecommunication and IT costs; facilities and customer management support; operational expenses for our operations centers; rent expenses; and\n\u2022travel and other billable costs to our clients; and\n\u2022costs relating to our direct mail operations and other digital solutions.\nThe most significant components of our cost of revenues are salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation), recruitment, training, transport, meals, rewards and recognition and employee insurance. Salary levels, employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues. Salary increases for most of our operations personnel are generally awarded each year effective April 1. However, during 2020, in response to certain anticipated impacts from COVID-19, we implemented a series of temporary cost reduction measures including deferring the scheduled increases in base salaries of all eligible employees and temporarily reducing the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees. Some of these actions have been reversed as of December 31, 2020. We make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements. Although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated, a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher-than-expected number of unassigned employees, which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees, particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services, would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency, productivity and profit margins. In addition, cost of revenues also includes non-cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients.\nWe expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operating centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally. In particular, we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients and provide existing staff with additional skill sets. There is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients. As our existing competitors continue to grow, and as new competitors enter the market, we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase, with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our work from home model, invest in information technology solutions and security measures to safeguard against information security risks and costs to protect the health and safety of our employees as they gradually return to the office. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d under Risks Related to Our Business-Employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin\u201d and under Risks Related to the International Nature of Our Business-If more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize, our profitability may be adversely affected.\u201d However, a significant portion of our client contracts include inflation-based adjustments to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues.\nWe generally experience a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during the initial 12 to 18 months in a long-term BPM contract due to upfront investments in infrastructure, resource hiring and training during migration. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues improve as we scale up, achieve operational efficiencies and complete the migration.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nOur general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries and benefits (including stock based compensation) as well as costs related to recruitment, training and retention of senior management and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities, travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs. General and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees (which represent the costs of third party legal, tax, accounting and other advisors), investment in product development, digital technology, advanced automation and robotics, bad debt allowance and non-cash amortization of stock compensation expenses related to our issuance of equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect our G&A costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development, performance management and training programs.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits (including stock based compensation) and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel, sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation of our tangible assets, including network equipment, cabling, computers, office furniture and equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets. As we add new facilities and expand our existing operations centers, we expect that depreciation expense will increase, reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers, servers and other infrastructure. We expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges pertain to the write down of carrying values to fair values of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We perform our annual impairment test annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, for all our reporting units and intangible assets. Based on the results, if the carrying values of our reporting units exceeds their fair values, we record impairment charges to the extent that carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Such assets are required to be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of the assets is higher than the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets. The impairment amount to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value.\nForeign Exchange\nWe report our financial results in the U.S. dollar. However, a significant portion of our total revenues are earned in the U.K. pound sterling (8.3% and 10.2%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019), while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in Indian rupees (27.2% and 25.6%, respectively, of our total costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019) and the Philippine peso (11.5% and 7.9%, of our total costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019). The exchange rates among the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future as well. The results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso and the U.K. pound sterling appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 - Derivatives and Hedge Accounting to our consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.\u201d\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consist of interest on our borrowings under our credit facility and convertible senior notes, finance lease liabilities and notional interest implicit in the purchase of property and equipment.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gain/(loss) on sale, mark to market and dividend income on our investments in mutual funds, and interest on time deposits classified under Cash and cash equivalents\u201d, Short-term investments\u201d and Other assets\u201d, as applicable on our consolidated balance sheets. Other income, net also consists of changes in fair value of earn-out consideration, interest on refunds received from income tax authorities in India on completion of tax assessments and components of net periodic benefit cost such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gain or loss and profit or loss on disposal of long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Our tax expense and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations and the potential adverse outcome of tax examinations. Changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which may result from a decline in our profitability or changes in tax rates or legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense.\nDuring the year 2018, we made an election to change the tax status of most of our controlled foreign corporations ( CFC\u201d) to disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we no longer have undistributed earnings in connection with these CFCs. The Transition Tax resulted in previously taxed income ( PTI\u201d) which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency gains or losses upon repatriation. We periodically evaluate opportunities to repatriate PTI held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to repatriate such PTI, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions.\nIn 2019, the Government of India introduced a new tax regime for certain Indian companies by enacting the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019. The new tax regime is optional and provides for a lower tax rate for Indian companies, subject to certain conditions, which among other things includes not availing of specified exemptions or incentives. During the year 2019 and 2020, we elected this new tax regime for our Indian subsidiaries to obtain the benefit of a lower tax rate.\nWe also benefited from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for our operations centers established there over the last several years. The tax holiday expired for few of our centers in last few years and will expire for other centers by year 2022,\nwhich may lead to an increase in our overall tax rate. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in the Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate, which as of December 31, 2020 was 5.0% on gross income.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. We determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain at the time an estimate is made. These policies include revenue recognition, allowance for expected credit losses, business combinations, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, derivative instruments and hedging activity, borrowings, assumptions related to lease liabilities, ROU assets, lease cost, income taxes and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans. These accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below. Future events may not develop exactly as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when services are provided to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services provided.\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes discounts and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by providing services to a customer.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nSignificant judgments\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe sometimes enter into contracts with our clients which include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the client. Determining whether products and services are considered as distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately rather than as one performance obligation may require significant judgment. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations on relative standalone selling price basis.\nJudgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, it is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nVariable Consideration\nVariability in the transaction price arises primarily due to service level agreements and volume discounts.\nWe consider our experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration that should be recognized during a period.\nWe believe that the expected value method is most appropriate for determining the variable consideration since we have a large number of contracts with similar nature of transactions/services.\nType of Contracts Requiring Judgment\na.Revenues for our fixed-price contracts are recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. The use of this method requires significant judgment to estimate the cost required to complete the contracted scope of work, including\nassumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and resources engaged. We regularly monitor these estimates throughout the execution of the project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined. If a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project, such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified.\nb.Revenues from reimbursement optimization services having contingent fee arrangements are recognized by us at the point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon the actual collections made by our customers and net of any subsequent retraction claims. Based on guidance on variable consideration\u201d in Topic 606, we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue based upon such expected recoveries. Any adjustment required due to change in estimates are recorded in the period in which such change is identified.\nFor additional information, see Note 5 - Revenues, net to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nUnbilled Receivables\nUnbilled receivables represent revenues recognized for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date. Unbilled receivables also include revenues recognized from reimbursement optimization services where we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon and collectable only when the actual collections are made by our customers. Based on guidance on variable consideration\u201d in Topic 606, we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue and receivables based upon such expected recoveries. Accordingly, the amounts for which services have been performed and for which invoices have not been issued to customers on the balance sheet date, (i.e. unbilled receivables) are presented under accounts receivable.\nDeferred Revenue and contract fulfillment costs\nWe have contract liabilities (deferred revenue) consisting of advance billings and billing in excess of revenues recognized. Deferred revenue also includes the amount for which services have been rendered but other conditions of revenue recognition are not met, for example where we do not have an enforceable contract.\nFurther, we also defer revenues attributable to certain process transition activities, with respect to our customers where such activities do not represent separate performance obligations. Revenues related to such transition activities are classified under Deferred revenue\u201d and Other non-current liabilities\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are performed.\nCosts related to such transition activities are contract fulfillment costs, and thereby classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers, under Cost of revenues\u201d in our consolidated statements of income.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nDirect and incremental costs incurred for acquiring contracts, such as sales commissions are contract acquisition costs and thereby classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers and recorded under Selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nUpfront Payment Made to Customers\nUpfront payments in nature of deal signing discount or deal signing bonuses made to customers are contract assets and classified under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit and are recorded as an adjustment to transaction price and reduced from revenues.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\nWe record accounts receivable net of allowances for expected credit losses. Allowances for credit losses are established through the evaluation of aging of accounts receivables, prior collection experience, current market conditions, forecasts about future economic conditions, clients' financial condition and the amount of accounts receivable in dispute to estimate the collectability of these accounts receivable.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations\u201d. The guidance requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in allocation of the purchase price in determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets and contingent consideration and allocation of purchase price over such assets and liabilities on the acquisition date. The significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on, among other things, anticipated growth rates and customer attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the reporting units to which it is assigned. We undertake studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and allocate purchase consideration to assets and liabilities, including property and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangibles. We examine the carrying value of the goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. We also assesses any potential goodwill impairment for our reporting units immediately prior to any segment changes and reallocate goodwill basis the new reporting units.\nThe goodwill quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of the income approach, using discounted cash flow analysis ( DCF model\u201d), and also the market approach, using market multiples for reporting units whereby the fair value is not substantially in excess of carrying value. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The discount rate is mainly based on judgment of the specific risk inherent within each reporting unit. The variables within the discount rate, many of which are outside of our control, provide us best estimate of all assumptions applied within the DCF model. Discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations range from 10.4% to 12.0%. We also use the Market approach\u201d to corroborate the results of the income approach for some of our reporting units. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit and comparable market transactions. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nDetermining fair value requires the use of estimates and exercise of significant judgment, including assumptions about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market multiples of revenues and earnings and comparable market transactions. These estimates and judgements may not be within our control and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the estimates and judgments described above could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized, in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of discounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The estimate of discounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, risk-free rates, market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nStock-based Compensation\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC No. 718\u201d), cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised and the expected volatility of our stock.\nWe also grant performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs\u201d) to executive officers and other specified employees. Generally the grants provide that 50% of the PRSUs cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on an aggregated revenue target ( PUs\u201d) for a three-year period. The remaining 50% vest based on a market condition ( MUs\u201d) that is contingent on EXL meeting or exceeding the total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies specified under the program, measured over a three-year performance period. The award recipient may earn up to 200% of the PRSUs granted based on the actual achievements of both targets. However, the features of our equity incentive compensation program are subject to change by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\nThe fair value of each PU is determined based on the market price of one share of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value for the MUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates a range of possible future stock prices and estimates the probabilities of the potential payouts. The Monte Carlo simulation model also involves the use of additional key assumptions, including dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. We periodically assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and update our estimates as required. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nIn the normal course of business, we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into various foreign currency exchange forward contracts, with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.\nWe hedge forecasted transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, until the hedged transactions occurs. The resultant foreign exchange gain/(loss) upon settlement of these cash flow hedges is recorded along with the underlying hedged item in the same line in our consolidated statements of income as either part of Cost of revenues\u201d, General and administrative expenses\u201d, Selling and marketing expenses\u201d, or Depreciation and amortization expense\u201d, as applicable.\nWe also use derivative instruments consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts to economically hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. These derivatives do not qualify as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain/(loss).\nWe determine the fair value of our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts. The quotes are taken primarily from independent sources, including highly rated financial institutions.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness of cash flow hedges at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period, any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings.\nBorrowings\nWe account for convertible notes in accordance with the guidelines established by the ASC No. 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. We separate the convertible notes into liability and equity components. The Beneficial Conversion Feature (\"BCF\") of a convertible note, which is the equity component and recorded as additional paid-in capital, is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature of certain notes payable that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or in-the-money when issued. We record a BCF related to any issuance of convertible notes.\nIf a convertible note is within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections contains embedded features other than the embedded conversion option, the guidance in ASC No. 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging - Embedded Derivatives ( ASC 815-15\u201d), is applied to determine if any of those features must be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument.\nThe estimated fair value of the liability component at issuance is determined using a discounted cash flow technique, which considers debt issuances with similar features of our convertible notes, excluding the conversion feature. The excess of the gross proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component is allocated to the BCF, which is credited to additional paid-in-capital with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the convertible notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the convertible notes using the effective interest method.\nDirect, incremental finance costs related to the convertible notes are amortized over the term instrument through charges to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nWe may elect to settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. We presently intend and have the ability to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income tax using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved. Deferred tax assets are recognized in full, subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. With respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday, deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday.\nWe also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required. A reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is probable and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such reserves are based on estimates and, consequently, are subject to changing facts and circumstances, including the progress of ongoing audits, changes in case law and the passage of new legislation. We believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover any current tax assessments.\nDuring the year 2018, we made an election to change the tax status of most of our controlled foreign corporations ( CFC\u201d) to disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we no longer have undistributed earnings in connection with these CFCs. The Transition Tax resulted in previously taxed income ( PTI\u201d) which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency gains or losses upon repatriation. We periodically evaluate opportunities to repatriate PTI held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to repatriate such PTI, we may have to accrue additional taxes which will be recorded in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. See Note 22 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nWe employ a two-step process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining, based on the technical merits, that the position will, more likely than not, be sustained upon examination. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe record contributions to defined contribution plans in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which services are rendered by the covered employees. Current service costs for defined benefit plans are recognized in the period to which they relate. The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated annually by using the projected unit credit method and various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, mortality, expected return on assets, expected increase in the compensation rates and attrition rates. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually. If actual results differ\nsignificantly from our estimates, current service costs for defined benefit plans and our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe include the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the respective employees during the period. The interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/loss, are included in - Other income, net\u201d. See Note 20 - Employee Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nWe recognize the liabilities for compensated absences dependent on whether the obligation is attributable to employee services already rendered, relates to rights that vest or accumulate and payment is probable and estimable.\nLeases\nWe account for a lease at the inception of the contract. Operating leases are recorded in Operating lease right-of-use assets\u201d, Current portion of operating lease liabilities\u201d and Operating lease liabilities, less current portion\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are recorded in Property and equipment, net\u201d, and the current and non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are presented within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d and Other non-current liabilities,\u201d respectively in our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease arrangement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate at commencement date by adjusting the benchmark reference rates, applicable to the respective geographies where the leases are entered, with appropriate financing spreads and lease specific adjustments for the effects of collateral.\nLease terms includes our assessment for the effects of options to extend or terminate the lease. We consider the extension option as part of our lease term for those lease arrangements where we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.\nWe account for lease-related concessions to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 on lessees in accordance with guidance in Topic 842, Leases, to determine, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether the concession provided by lessor should be accounted for as a lease modification.\nWe account for a modification as a separate contract when it grants an additional right of use not included in the original lease and the increase is commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use, adjusted for the circumstances of the particular contract. Modifications which are not accounted for as a separate contract are reassessed as of the effective date of the modification based on its modified terms and conditions and the facts and circumstances as of that date. The lease liability is remeasured to reflect changes to the remaining lease payments and discount rates and we recognize the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. However, if the carrying amount of the ROU assets is reduced to zero as a result of modification, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nContingencies\nLoss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, we do not record a liability, but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Significant judgment is required in the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable, both. Our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n(1) Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDue to rounding, the numbers presented in the tables included in this Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d may not add up precisely to the totals provided.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues.\nThe following table summarizes our revenues by reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $958.4 million, down $32.9 million, or 3.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, which was primarily related to clients adapting to the shift in our delivery capabilities from a physical to a virtual, work-from-home operating environment as well as economic uncertainty leading to lower volumes from some existing clients and causing delays in the execution and implementation of new client contracts, which impacted growth.\nRevenue decline in Insurance of $4.6 million was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by expansion of business from certain existing clients aggregating to $3.4 million and a decline in revenues of $1.3 million attributable to the depreciation of the Indian rupee and South African ZAR against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Insurance revenues were 35.7% and 34.9% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Healthcare of $3.7 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $16.2 million, partially offset by our December 2019 wind-down of Health Integrated business revenues of $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Healthcare revenues were 10.6% and 9.8% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue decline in Emerging Business of $37.4 million was primarily driven by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19 and ramp-down of certain client contracts aggregating to $35.6 million, and a decline of $1.8 million attributable to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Emerging Business revenues were 15.9% and 19.2% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Analytics of $5.4 million was attributable to our recurring and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients, partially offset by lower volumes due to the impact of COVID-19 aggregating to $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Analytics revenues were 37.8% and 36.0% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin: The following table sets forth cost of revenues and gross margin of our reportable segments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of revenues was $623.9 million compared to $655.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 4.8%. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 34.9% compared to 33.9% for year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 100 basis points (\"bps\").\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Insurance of $6.7 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $4.0 million, lower travel costs of $4.4 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.2 million. This was partially offset by higher infrastructure and technology costs of $3.3 million, primarily related to the work from home enablement and other operating costs of $0.6 million. Gross margin in Insurance increased by 110 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to expansion in margin in certain existing clients, partially offset by COVID-19 related incremental expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $4.0 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $3.1 million, lower travel costs of $0.5 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $0.4 million. Gross margin in Healthcare increased by 690 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower margin in the Heath Integrated business during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by COVID-19 related incremental expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $19.1 million was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs of $14.2 million, lower infrastructure and technology costs of $2.5 million, lower travel costs of $1.9 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher other operating costs of $0.8 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business decreased by 150 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower revenues and COVID-19 related incremental expenses.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Analytics of $1.8 million was primarily due to lower other operating costs of $6.7 million, lower travel costs of $4.6 million, foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.2 million and lower infrastructure costs of $1.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related costs of $10.5 million and technology costs of $2.3 million. Gross margin in Analytics increased by 140 bps during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher revenues and expansion in margin in certain existing clients.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses.\n\nThe decrease in SG&A expenses of $24.7 million was primarily due to COVID-19 cost reduction measures, including the temporary reduction of the base salaries of our executive officers and certain other groups of employees. The decrease was driven by lower employee-related costs of $14.7 million, lower travel costs of $6.5 million, lower other operating costs of $2.2 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.3 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\n\nThe decrease in intangibles amortization expense of $7.2 million was primarily due to end of useful lives for certain intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in depreciation expense of $5.7 million was primarily due to depreciation related to our investments in new operating centers, internally developed software and accelerated depreciation resulting from a reduction in useful lives related to several operating centers, due to the impact of COVID-19.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.1 million and impairment charges of $3.6 million in connection with the wind-down of our Health Integrated business.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations increased by $33.6 million, or 43.9%, from $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower SG&A expenses of $24.7 million and impairment and restructuring charges of $8.7 million incurred in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, income from operations increased from 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss). Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to the movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling, the Philippine peso, and the South African ZAR during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 70.36 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 74.07 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 1.28 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.29 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso decreased from 51.57 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 49.49 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the South African ZAR increased from 14.43 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 16.51 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to repayments of borrowings leading to lower outstanding borrowings and lower effective interest rates of 2.3% under our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.0% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther Income, net..\n\nOther income, net decreased by $4.4 million, from $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower return on mutual fund investments of $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and recognition of other income of $0.8 million related to our Health Integrated business during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense. The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 22.2% during the year ended December 31, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $25.6 million and $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of (i) higher profit during the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) recording of a one-time tax expense of $1.3 million due to electing a new tax regime for two of our Indian subsidiaries which provides for a lower tax rate on earnings in exchange for foregoing certain tax credits during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $1.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income. Net income increased from $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $33.6 million, lower interest expense of $2.4 million and higher foreign exchange gain, net of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $10.4 million and decrease in other income, net of $4.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 9.3% during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues.\nThe following table summarizes our revenues by reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $991.3 million, up $108.2 million, or 12.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue growth in Insurance of $35.2 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $38.6 million. This was partially offset by $3.4 million mainly attributable to the depreciation of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, U.K. pound sterling and South African ZAR against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Insurance revenues were 34.9% and 35.2% of our total revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Healthcare of $7.7 million was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients and new wins aggregating to $12.9 million, partially offset by lower revenues from our Health Integrated business of $5.2 million. Healthcare revenues were 9.8% and 10.2% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nRevenue decline in Emerging Business of $6.7 million was primarily driven by lower revenues from project based engagements and lower revenues from existing clients of $4.7 million. Further decline of $2.0 million was mainly due to the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Emerging Business revenues were 19.2% and 22.3% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nRevenue growth in Analytics of $72.0 million was primarily driven by our acquisition of SCIOinspire Holdings Inc. ( SCIO\u201d), a health analytics solution and services company, in July 2018 and increase in revenues from our recurring and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients. This was partially offset by $1.0 million attributable to the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling and Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Analytics revenues were 36.0% and 32.3% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin: The following table sets forth cost of revenues and gross margin of our reportable segments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of revenues was $655.5 million compared to $584.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $70.7 million, or 12.1%. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 33.9% compared to 33.8% for year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 10 bps.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Insurance of $26.8 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $24.3 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, increase in technology cost of $3.4 million and increase in infrastructure and travel cost of $2.9 million. This was partially offset by lower other operating costs of $1.1 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.7 million. Gross margin in Insurance decreased by 80 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher operating expenses.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $6.7 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $7.3 million and higher other operating costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.0 million. Gross margin in Healthcare decreased by 70 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher operating expenses associated with the initiation of services for new and existing clients.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $9.4 million was primarily due to decrease in employee-related costs of $4.2 million, lower infrastructure and travel cost of $3.2 million, lower other operating costs of $0.4 million, and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.6 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business increased by 280 bps during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to expansion in margin in certain new and existing clients.\nThe increase in cost of revenues in Analytics of $46.6 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $42.7 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, including incremental cost related to our acquisition of SCIO in July 2018. The remaining increase was attributable to other operating costs of $5.8 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.9 million. Gross margin in Analytics during 2019 as compared to 2018 was flat.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses.\n\nThe increase in SG&A expenses of $18.9 million was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $19.5 million, including incremental costs related to our SCIO acquisition in July 2018 and net increase in other operating costs of $1.0 million. This was partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.6 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\n\nThe increase in depreciation expense of $2.2 million was due to depreciation related to our new operating centers to support our business growth and depreciation associated with our SCIO acquisition of $2.8 million. This was partially offset by currency movements, net of hedging of $0.6 million. The increase in intangibles amortization expense of $1.2 million was primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with our SCIO acquisition in July 2018, partially offset by the impact of amortization of intangibles related to our Health Integrated acquisition, which were impaired during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.1 million and impairment charges of $3.6 million in connection with the wind down of Health Integrated business within our Healthcare operating segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $20.1 million to write down the carrying value of goodwill of $14.2 million and intangible assets of $5.9 million to their fair values related to our Health Integrated business. See Note 10 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 24 - Impairment and Restructuring Charges to our consolidated financial statements for details.\nIncome from Operations.

Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 68.48 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 70.36 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.33 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 1.28 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso decreased from 52.69 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 51.57 during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the net foreign exchange gain of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increase in average borrowings on account of issuance of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2018 and higher effective interest rates under our Credit Facility.\nOther Income, net\n\nOther income, net increased by $3.5 million, from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a higher return on mutual fund investments of $3.0 million and an increase in interest and dividend income of $0.5 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. The effective tax rate increased from 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 18.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019. We recorded income tax expense of $15.2 million and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of (i) recording of a one-time tax benefit of $6.3 million with respect to unused 2018 foreign branch income tax credits under regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) recording of higher excess tax benefits related to stock awards of $7.2 million pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, (iii) lower tax expense of $3.1 million on account of impairment and restructuring charges recorded during the year December 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by (iv) higher tax exemptions/incentives and a lower tax rate for qualifying Indian subsidiaries due to a change in legislation during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income. Net income increased from $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $26.6 million and increase in other income, net of $3.5 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $11.8 million, higher interest expense of $6.4 million and lower foreign exchange gain, net of $1.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from 6.4% during the year ended December 31, 2018 to 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $402.8 million and $321.4 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $335.3 million and $250.4 million, respectively, is located in foreign jurisdictions that upon distribution may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We periodically evaluate opportunities regarding distribution to fund our operations in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to distribute, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions.\nOperating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $203.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting higher cash earnings along with lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $34.6 million year-over-year included the following:\n\u2022Increase in net income of $21.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of $33.6 million driven by lower operating expenses, offset by higher income tax expense of $10.4 million and lower other income, net of interest expense of $1.4 million.\n\u2022Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed additional cash flow of $43.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was a result of the higher collections of our accounts receivables and advance collections from certain customers. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 53 days as of December 31, 2020 from 59 days as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Decrease in accrued employee costs, accrued expenses and other liabilities contributed reduced cash flow of $40.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily because of additional cash flow of $30.9 million due to higher annual performance incentives and accrued expenses in 2019 compared to reduced cash flow of $9.4 million from lower accrued expenses in 2020.\n\u2022Other drivers increasing cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019 included: income tax expense, net of advances and deferred taxes, of $8.6 million, primarily due to higher income tax provisions and timing of payments; and changes in various current assets and other assets aggregating to $1.4 million, primarily due to lower upfront payment to customers.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting higher cash earnings along with lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $76.0 million year-over-year included the following:\n\u2022Increase in net income of $10.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of $26.6 million driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $11.8 million and lower interest and other income of $3.9 million.\n\u2022Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed additional cash flow of $14.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was a result of the growth in our revenues (including revenues from our SCIO acquisition in July 2018) and higher collections of our accounts receivable. As a result, our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 59 days in 2019 from 62 days in 2018.\n\u2022Increases in accrued employee costs, accrued expenses and other liabilities contributed additional cash flow of $30.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily resulting from higher annual performance incentives and other employee costs accruals of $15.6 million, higher accrued expenses of $8.2 million due to an increase in our cost base to support\nrevenue growth, and lower cash outflows in client liabilities of $4.3 million due to lower funds held on behalf of our clients.\n\u2022Other drivers increasing operating cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 included: income tax expense, net of advances and deferred taxes, of $9.6 million, primarily due to higher income tax provisions and timing of payments; and changes in various current assets and other assets aggregating to $10.3 million, primarily due to higher recovery of our receivables from statutory authorities in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInvesting Activities: Cash flows used for investing activities were $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly due to net redemption of investments of $23.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net purchase of investments of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by higher capital expenditures for purchase of long-lived assets, including investments in infrastructure, technology assets, software and product developments of $0.9 million and acquisition of additional stake in our equity affiliate of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash flows used for investing activities were $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $277.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is mainly due to higher cash used for the SCIO acquisition of $231.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by net higher purchase of investments of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to net purchase of investments of $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFinancing Activities: Cash flows used for financing activities were $89.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $93.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash flows used for financing activities was primarily due to net repayment of $10.9 million (net of proceeds) under our revolving Credit Facility (as described below in Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)-Credit Agreement\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net repayments of $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, higher proceeds received from exercise of stock options by $0.5 million, partially offset by higher purchases of treasury stock by $38.6 million under our share Repurchase Programs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash flows used for financing activities were $93.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $197.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flows provided from financing activities was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $240.4 million (net of repayment) under our revolving Credit Facility and Convertible Notes (as described below in Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)-Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net repayments (net of proceeds) of $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by lower purchases of treasury stock by $1.7 million under our share Repurchase Programs during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business by making investments, primarily related to new facilities and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements to build our facilities, digital capabilities and purchase telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations.\nWe incurred $42.2 million of capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of between $35.0 million to $40.0 million in 2021, primarily to meet our growth requirements, including additions to our facilities as well as investments in technology applications, product development, digital technology, advanced automation, robotics and infrastructure.\nIn connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries, we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to such assessment orders (see Note 26 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements herein for further details). We anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our smaller acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital needs. If we have significant growth through acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional financing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, management has taken certain precautionary measures, including: drawing $100.0 million from our line of credit under our Credit Agreement on March 12, 2020, the proceeds of which were available for working capital, general corporate or other purposes as needed, and which was repaid in full on April 20, 2020; and electing to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our 2019 Repurchase Program, and other cost reduction measures related to employee and vendor expenses and capital expenditure plans. The 2019\nRepurchase Program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and the management using its discretion has resumed share repurchases effective July 1, 2020, considering improved market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. However, there is no assurance that the impacts we have experienced to date, and any future impact we may experience, from COVID-19 will not have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, (the CARES Act\u201d) allows employers to defer the payment of the employer share of Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA\u201d) taxes for the period from April 1, 2020 and ending December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we deferred our contributions to FICA of $6.3 million under the CARES Act. The deferred amount will be payable as follows: (1) 50% of the deferred amount will be paid on December 31, 2021 and (2) the remaining 50% of the deferred amount will be paid on December 31, 2022.\nFinancing Arrangements (Debt Facility and Notes)\nThe following tables summarizes our debt balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n\n*Unamortized debt issuance costs for our revolving Credit Facility of $0.5 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, is presented under Other current assets\u201d and Other assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 21, 2017, we and each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement with certain lenders, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with an option to increase the commitments by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain approvals and conditions as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also includes a letter of credit sub facility. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of November 21, 2022 and is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. On July 2, 2018, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to increase the commitments by $100.0 million thereby utilizing the entire revolver under the Credit Facility of $300.0 million to fund our July 2018 acquisition of SCIO.\nDepending on the type of borrowing, loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted LIBO rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0% to 0.75% per annum with respect to loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and\n1.00% to 1.75% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted LIBO rate. The revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee which is also tied to our total net leverage ratio, and ranges from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d under Risks Related to Our Indebtedness - We may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. We could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all.\u201d\nThe revolving Credit Facility carried an effective interest rate as shown below:-\n\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by all or substantially all of our assets and that of our material domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and related distributions, enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions and dispose of assets or subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant to not permit the interest coverage ratio or the total net leverage ratio, both as defined for the four consecutive quarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than 3.5 to 1.0 or more than 3.0 to 1.0, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants listed under the Credit Agreement.\nWe entered into a second amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, as amended, among the Company, as borrower, with certain lenders, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent to, among other things, permit the issuance by the Company of the Notes, and settlement upon maturity or conversion thereof, in accordance with the Investment Agreement, the indenture dated as of October 4, 2018 and the other documents entered into in connection therewith.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into an investment agreement (the Investment Agreement\u201d) with Orogen Echo LLC (the Purchaser\u201d), an affiliate of The Orogen Group LLC, relating to the issuance to the Purchaser of $150.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of 3.50% per annum Convertible Senior Notes due October 1, 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued on October 4, 2018. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 13.3333 shares of the common stock per one thousand dollar principal amount of the Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $75 per share). With certain exceptions, upon a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the Notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem the principal amount of the Notes, at its option, in whole but not in part, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on or after October 1, 2021, if the closing sale price of the common stock exceeds 150% of the then-current conversion price for 20 or more trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period preceding our exercise of this redemption right (including the trading day immediately prior to the date of the notice of redemption).We may elect to settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We presently intend and have the ability to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash. In 2018, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay $150.0 million of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nWe accounted for the liability and equity components of the Notes separately to reflect its non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The estimated fair value of the liability component at issuance of $133.1 million was determined using a discounted cash flow technique, which considered debt issuances with similar features of our debt, excluding the conversion feature. The resulting effective interest rate for the Notes was 5.75% per annum. The excess of the gross proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component totaling $16.9 million, was allocated to the conversion feature (equity component, recorded as additional paid-in capital) with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the Notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense over a six-year period ending October 1, 2024 (the expected life of the liability component) using the effective interest method.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest expense and amortization of debt discount, on the Notes as below:\n\nUnder the terms of the Notes, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit to third parties primarily for facility leases. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million, each, that were not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. These are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\n\n(a) Represents undiscounted operating lease liabilities payable over the lease term.\n(b) Represents estimated employee benefit payments under the Gratuity Plan.\n(c) Represents our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of our Notes of $150 million in cash and does not reflect any assumptions about our ability or intent to settle the Notes before their maturity.\n(d) Interest on borrowings is calculated based on the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020.\n(e) Excludes $0.9 million related to uncertain tax positions, since the extent of the amount and timing of payment is currently not reliably estimable or determinable.\nCertain units of our Indian subsidiaries were established as 100% Export-Oriented units under the Software Technology Parks of India ( STPI\u201d) or Special Economic Zone (\"SEZ\") scheme promulgated by the Government of India. These units are exempt from customs, central excise duties, and levies on imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares. We have undertaken to pay custom duties, service taxes, levies, and liquidated damages payable, if any, in respect of imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. We believe, however, that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions.\nOur operations centers in the Philippines are registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority ( PEZA\u201d). The registration provides us with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and local purchase of services and materials and requires that ExlService Philippines, Inc. to meet certain performance and investment criteria. We believe that these centers have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required criteria.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements,

million, down 3.3% compared to 2019 due to lower volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net income increased from $67.7 million in 2019 to $89.5 million in 2020 due to higher income from operations and lower interest expense.\n\nSegment Performance\n- Insurance revenues declined slightly but profit margins improved. Healthcare revenues grew driven by new wins while margins expanded significantly. Emerging Business revenues fell due to lower volumes but margins held steady. Analytics revenues rose marginally with higher margins.\n\nExpenses & Costs\n- Cost of revenues fell due to declines in employee, travel and infrastructure costs stemming from COVID-19. Gross margin improved from 33.9% to 34.9%. SG&A costs dropped 12% thanks to cost reduction initiatives. \n\nCash Flows & Liquidity\n- Operating cash flows rose on higher cash earnings and working capital improvements. Cash from operations funded capital expenditures of $42.2 million. The company drew down $100 million from its credit facility in March 2020 as a precautionary measure but repaid it in April 2020. Total debt declined to $227 million.\n\nOutlook\n- COVID-19 caused revenue declines and delivery disruptions in 2020 but digital delivery capabilities proved resilient. Cost actions provided some offset. The outlook remains uncertain depending on the pandemic's ongoing impact."}
