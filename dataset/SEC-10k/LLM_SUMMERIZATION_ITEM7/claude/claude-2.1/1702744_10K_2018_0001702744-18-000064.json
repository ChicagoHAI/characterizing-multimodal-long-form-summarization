Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding the Company's expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nAtkins fiscal year ends the last Saturday in August. Atkins' fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 and August 27, 2016, respectively, and were each fifty-two week periods. Atkins' fiscal quarters are comprised of 13 weeks each, except for fifty-three week fiscal periods for the which the fourth quarter will be comprised of fourteen weeks, and end on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter (fourteenth Saturday of the fourth quarter, when applicable). Atkins' fiscal quarters for fiscal 2018 ended on November 24, 2017, February 24, 2018, May 26, 2018 and August 25, 2018.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, information is presented for the successor period for the fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018, the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017, the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017 and the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 are derived from Atkins' audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nOverview\nSimply Good Foods is a developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional foods and snacking products. Our highly-focused product portfolio consists primarily of nutrition bars, RTD shakes, snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins\u00ae, SimplyProtein\u00ae, Atkins Harvest Trail and Atkins Endulge\u00ae brand names. Over the past 45 years, Atkins has become an iconic American brand that for many consumers stands for low carb,\u201d low sugar\u201d and protein rich\u201d nutrition. The Atkins philosophy focuses on a healthy nutritional approach with reduced levels of refined carbohydrates and refined sugars and encourages the consumption of lean protein, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and good fats.\nIn our core Atkins snacking business, we strive to offer a complete line of nutrition bars, ready-to-drink shakes and confections that satisfy hunger while providing consumers with a convenient, better-for-you\u201d snacking alternative. Our sales, marketing and R&D capabilities enable us to distribute products into a national customer base across the mass merchandiser, grocery and drug channels. We believe that Atkins' broad brand recognition, depth of management talent and strong cash generation position us to continue to innovate in the Atkins brand and acquire other brands, and thereby become an industry leading snacking platform. To that end, in December 2016, Atkins completed the acquisition of Wellness Foods, Inc. ( Wellness Foods\u201d), a Canada-based developer, marketer and seller of the SimplyProtein\u00ae brand that is focused on protein-rich and low-sugar products, which our management believes has significant opportunity for expansion in the U.S. In addition to snacking products, Atkins entered into a license arrangement in 2014 for frozen meals sold in the U.S. by Bellisio Foods, Inc.\nMatters Affecting Comparability\nThe Simply Good Foods Company ( Simply Good Foods\u201d) was formed on March 30, 2017 to consummate a business combination with NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. ( Atkins\u201d) and Conyers Park Acquisition Corp ( Conyers Park\u201d). Conyers Park, a special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC\u201d), was formed on April 20, 2016 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.\nOn April 10, 2017, Conyers Park and Atkins entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, Conyers Park and Atkins combined under a new holding company, Simply Good Foods, which was listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SMPL\u201d as of closing of the Business Combination.\nOn July 7, 2017 (the Closing Date\u201d) Simply Good Foods completed the business combination with Conyers Park and Atkins (the Business Combination\u201d). As a result, Simply Good Foods owns all of the equity in Atkins.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods is the acquirer for accounting purposes and the successor while Atkins is the acquiree and accounting predecessor. Our financial statement presentation includes the financial statements of Atkins as Predecessor\u201d for periods prior to the Closing Date and of Simply Good Foods for periods after the Closing Date, including the consolidation of Atkins. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we are obligated to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA\u201d). See Note 9, Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, for a detailed discussion of the TRA.\nFor convenience, we have also included pro forma combined information for the comparable periods of fiscal 2017 as if the Business Combination had been completed at the beginning of the 2017 fiscal year. References in this Annual Report to information provided on a pro forma basis refer to such pro forma combined financial information.\nOur Reportable Segment\nOur business is organized around one reportable segment based on our go-to-market strategies, the objectives of the business and how our chief decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.\nKey Financial Definitions\nNet sales.

The pro forma combined adjustments are based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma combined basis, the impact of these transactions on the historical financial information of our Predecessor and Successor entities, as applicable.\nThe Business Combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information contains a variety of adjustments, assumptions and estimates, is subject to numerous other uncertainties and the assumptions and adjustments as described in the accompanying notes hereto and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our results of operations had the Business Combination occurred on August 28, 2016. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information also does not project our results of operations for any future period or date. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 includes results of the Successor and Predecessor entities. The pro forma combined adjustments give effect to the items identified in the pro forma combined table below in connection with the Business Combination.\nPro Forma Combined Statement of

Net sales of $431.4 million represented an increase of $35.3 million, or 8.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase in net sales is primarily due to organic sales growth of 8.3%, driven by increased sales of our products in the U.S., offset by 0.3% from the prior year recall receivable. In addition, the acquisition of Wellness Foods drove a 0.9% increase in net sales compared to the prior year.\nIn the third-quarter 10-Q the Company disclosed that it had historically recorded revenue on a FOB Shipping Point\u201d basis despite the fact that a significant portion of customer contracts indicated \"FOB Destination\" terms. As such, in the fourth quarter revenue was recorded on an \"FOB Destination\" basis, which resulted in a reduction to net sales of $7.8 million as of August 25, 2018.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased $13.9 million, or 6.6%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily due to sales volume growth of $16.5 million offset by an improvement in supply chain costs of $2.6 million.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased $21.3 million, or 11.5%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. Gross profit of $207.6 million, or 48.1% of net sales, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 increased 110 basis points from 47.0% of net sales for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily due to favorable changes in trade allowances and favorable supply chain costs, offset in part by the aforementioned recall reimbursement which had a 20 basis point benefit to gross margin in the previous year.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses increased $15.1 million, or 11.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 due to the following:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distribution.

Foreign currency gain decreased $0.5 million between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 and the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017.

Income tax expense decreased $36.2 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The difference is primarily due to the preliminary assessment of the tax law change on the Company's tax liabilities. For the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017, the effective tax rate assumed within the pro forma financial statements was 39.6%. For the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018, a provisional gain of $31.0 million pursuant to the change in tax law resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 32.7%. The change in tax law is discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.1 million, or 8.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

The unaudited pro forma income statement for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016 presents the historical consolidated statement of operations of Atkins for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016, giving effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on August 30, 2015.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements give effect to the Business Combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements also reflect the impact of the Atkins license arrangement for frozen meals sold in the U.S. by Bellisio. This agreement was effective September 1, 2016 and is a seven-year license with Bellisio to license Atkins' frozen meals business. Bellisio manufactures, distributes, markets, promotes and sells Atkins frozen food products under the Atkins licensed mark. The effects of the license agreement are presented in the Frozen License Adjustments\u201d and Atkins' Pro Forma\u201d columns in the unaudited historical consolidated statement of operations for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the Business Combination actually been completed sooner. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved if the Business Combination had been completed as of

Net sales increased $27.1 million, or 7.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by growth of $20.0 million in Atkins core business and the December 2016 addition of Wellness Foods of $7.1 million. The growth in the core business net sales was primarily driven by increased demand, growing volume $17.4 million and improved returns of $2.6 million. The improvement to returns was principally due to the 2016 recall expense which decreased 2016 net sales. The recall was subsequently reimbursed in 2017.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased $10.5 million, or 5.2%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016. The increase was primarily due to sales volume growth of $6.9 million and the Wellness Foods acquisition of $3.6 million.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased $16.7 million, or 9.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. Gross margin of 47.0% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 improved 110 bps from 45.9% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016 due to the favorable recall expense, cost saving initiatives and favorable mix.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses increased $5.8 million, or 4.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 due to the following:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Selling.

Loss on foreign currency transactions increased $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased $4.9 million from the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The difference is due to higher income from operations in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $8.3 million, or 12.9%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase was driven by the increase in gross profit. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to exclude the following items: stock-based compensation and warrant expense, transaction and IPO readiness costs, restructuring costs, management fees, frozen media licensing fees, non-core legal costs, transactional exchange impact, change in fair value of contingent consideration - TRA liability, business transaction costs and other non-core expenses. The Company believes that the inclusion of these supplementary adjustments in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors and reflects operating results more accurately of the on-going operations. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in calculation.\nThe following unaudited tables below provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss).\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

credit facilities. Our principal uses for liquidity have been debt service and working capital. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we are incurring as a public company for at least the next twelve months.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, we are obligated to make payments under the TRA. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA will vary, the payments that we will be required to make could be significant. Any payments made under the TRA will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and accrue interest until paid. See Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information on the TRA.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nOn July 7, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties. The credit agreement provides for a term facility of $200.0 million ( Term Facility\u201d) with a seven year maturity and a revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a five year maturity, under the first lien senior secured loan facilities (the First Lien\u201d). Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the Business Combination, the full $200.0 million of the First Lien term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) was drawn. No amounts were originally drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate per annum is based on either (i) a base rate equaling the higher of (a) the prime rate\u201d, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) the Euro-currency rate applicable for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% plus (x) 3.00% margin for Term Loan or (y) 2.00% margin for Revolving Credit Facility, or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus (x) 4.00% margin for the Term Loan subject to a floor of 1.00% or (y) 3.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility was adjusted after the completion of the Company's first full fiscal quarter after the closing of the Business Combination based upon the Company's consolidated First Lien net leverage ratio. As security for the payment or performance of its debt, the Company has pledged certain equity interests in its subsidiaries.\nOn March 16, 2018 (the Amendment Date\u201d), the Company entered into an amendment (the Repricing Amendment\u201d) to the First Lien. As a result of the Repricing Amendment, the interest rate on the Term Loan was reduced and, as of the Amendment Date, such loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.50% or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%. The Repricing Amendment did not change the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will continue to bear interest based upon the Company's consolidated First Lien net leverage ratio as of the last financial statements delivered to the administrative agent. No additional debt was incurred, or any proceeds received, by the Company in connection with the Repricing Amendment. The incremental fees paid to the administrative agent are reflected as additional debt discount and are amortized over the terms of the long-term financing agreements using the effective-interest method.\nThe First Lien is subject to mandatory prepayments based on contractual terms.\nThe credit facilities governing our debt arrangements contain certain financial and other covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.25:1.00 (with a reduction to 6.00:1.00 on and after the third anniversary of the closing date of the credit facilities) contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the revolving credit facility, and limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. The credit facilities governing our debt arrangements bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow. As the Company has not drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 25, 2018 and August 26, 2017, no debt covenants were applicable as of the period then ended.\nAs of August 25, 2018, the outstanding principal balances of the Term Loan was $198.5 million, and no amounts were drawn under the $75.0 million Revolving Credit Facility.\nEquity Warrants\nOn October 4, 2018, the Company announced that it will redeem all of its public warrants to purchase common stock that remain outstanding immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2018 (the Redemption Date\u201d). Any public warrants that remain unexercised immediately after the Redemption Date will be redeemed at a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant. In addition, in accordance with the warrant agreement for the public warrants, the Company's Board of Directors elected to require that all future exercises of the public warrants be exercised on a cashless basis. Accordingly, holders may no longer exercise public warrants in exchange for payment in cash of the $11.50 per share exercise price. Instead, a holder exercising a public warrant will be deemed to pay the $11.50 per share exercise price by the surrender of 0.61885 of a share of common stock that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon a cash exercise of each public warrant. Accordingly, by virtue of the cashless exercise of the public warrants, exercising holders of public warrants will receive 0.38115 of a share of the Company's common stock for each public warrant surrendered for exercise.\nFrom August 26, 2018 through October 4, 2018, public warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,886,663 shares of the Company's common stock were exercised for cash at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $113.7 million.\nThe Company's private warrants to purchase 6,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock remain outstanding as of the date of this report.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52-Weeks Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>From July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>From August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52-Weeks Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 25, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 27, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Successor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Successor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Predecessor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Predecessor)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(197,304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,458\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(815\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in (provided by) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $61.0 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, an increase of $88.4 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $27.4 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher income before taxes. The Company had $112.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of August 25, 2018, which is sufficient to satisfy current liabilities, current maturities of long-term debt and the interest payments associated with them.\nOur net cash used in operating activities was $27.4 million for the successor period ending August 26, 2017, a decrease of $49.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $21.9 million for the predecessor period ending July 6, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the transaction related expenses in the successor period offset by higher net income of approximately $2.9 million.\nInvesting activities. Our net cash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, which was a decrease of $193.8 million compared to the investing activities for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The change was due to the Business Combination in the successor period ended August 26, 2017, offset by minor increases in purchases of property and equipment .\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $197.3 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017, which was an increase in cash used of $176.8 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $20.5 million for the predecessor period. The large increase was due to the net exchange of cash in the Business Combination in the successor period of $196.8 million compared to the purchase of Wellness Foods for approximately $20.0 million (net of cash acquired) in December 2016 (predecessor period).\nFinancing activities. Our net cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $280.8 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The decrease is due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $191.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of equity of $97.0 million related to the Business Combination in the successor period ended August 26, 2017.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $280.8 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017, an increase of cash provided of $334.3 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $53.5 million for the predecessor period. This increase in cash provided was due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $191.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of equity of $97.0 million related to the Business Combination in the successor period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 25, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, income or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our expected material contractual payment obligations as of August 25, 2018.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of August 25, 2018, the Company is obligated under multiple non-cancellable operating leases, which continue through 2023.

Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing; however, the following discussion pertains to accounting policies the Company believes are most critical to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.\nBusiness Combinations\nAs discussed in detail in Note 3, Business Combination, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing, on July 7, 2017, Simply Good Foods acquired the Atkins business from Roark. The Business Combination was funded through a combination of cash, stock and debt financing.\nThe Business Combination is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nASC 805, Business Combinations, establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has historically recognized revenue at the time of shipment to its customers; however, upon examination of certain contractual arrangements, and as a result of the practice of refunding customers for products damaged in-transit, the risks and rewards of ownership of the products transferred at customer receipt. Accordingly, the Company concluded it should have recognized revenue upon customer receipt. These errors, along with the errors in prior annual and quarterly periods for which revenue for sales-in-transit was not appropriately deferred, are not material to the financial statements.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company deferred all revenue for shipments in-transit to customers totaling $7.8 million. The failure to defer revenues for sales-in-transit in the third quarter of 2018, resulted in an understatement of net sales of $8.2 million for revenue that was recorded in the third quarter that should have been deferred and recognized during the fourth quarter upon customer receipt.\nTrade Promotions\nThe Company offers trade promotions through various programs to customers and consumers. Trade promotions include discounts, rebates, slotting and other marketing activities. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the later of the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires management to make estimates regarding the volume of incentive that will be redeemed and their total cost. These estimates are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities, as well as the Company's best estimated of current activity.\nAt August 25, 2018 and August 26, 2017, the allowance for trade promotions was $7.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. These differences have historically been insignificant.\nTax Receivable Arrangement\nAs discussed in Note 3, Business Combination, and Note 9, Income Taxes, simultaneously with the closing of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA\u201d). The TRA is contingent consideration and included as part of the consideration transferred in the Business Combination. The Tax Receivable Agreement obligation was recorded at its acquisition-date fair value at inception and is classified as a liability. The Tax Receivable Agreement will generally provide for the payment by Simply\nGood Foods to the Selling Equity holders for certain federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax benefits deemed realized in post-closing taxable periods by Simply Good Foods, Conyers Park, Atkins and Atkins eligible subsidiaries from the use of up to $100 million of the following tax attributes: (i) net operating losses available to be carried forward as of the closing of the Business Combination; (ii) certain deductions generated by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) remaining depreciable tax basis from the 2003 acquisition of Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. As of August 25, 2018, the estimated fair value of these contingent payments is $27.5 million, which has been recorded as a liability and represents 100% of the value of the recorded tax attributes. Subsequent changes in fair value of the contingent liability will be recognized in earnings.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicated that potential impairment may be present. Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by performing either qualitative or quantitative assessments. In the qualitative assessment, factors including macro-economic conditions, industry and company-specific factors, legal and regulatory environments and historical company performance are evaluated in assessing fair value. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. When using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a impairment charge for the differential.\nQualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were performed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Based on the results of assessment, it was determined that it is more likely than not the reporting unit had a fair value in excess of carrying value. Accordingly, no further impairment testing was completed and no impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles were recognized during the fiscal periods ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 or August 27, 2016.\nThe Company also has intangible assets that are expected to have determinable useful lives, consisting primarily of trademarks, customer relationships and licensing agreements. Costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the fiscal periods ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 or August 27, 2016 there were no impairments recorded related to finite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nIncome taxes include federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing for further information regarding recently issued accounting standards.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding the Company's expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nAtkins fiscal year ends the last Saturday in August. Atkins' fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 and August 27, 2016, respectively, and were each fifty-two week periods. Atkins' fiscal quarters are comprised of 13 weeks each, except for fifty-three week fiscal periods for the which the fourth quarter will be comprised of fourteen weeks, and end on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter (fourteenth Saturday of the fourth quarter, when applicable). Atkins' fiscal quarters for fiscal 2018 ended on November 24, 2017, February 24, 2018, May 26, 2018 and August 25, 2018.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, information is presented for the successor period for the fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018, the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017, the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017 and the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 are derived from Atkins' audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nOverview\nSimply Good Foods is a developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional foods and snacking products. Our highly-focused product portfolio consists primarily of nutrition bars, RTD shakes, snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins\u00ae, SimplyProtein\u00ae, Atkins Harvest Trail and Atkins Endulge\u00ae brand names. Over the past 45 years, Atkins has become an iconic American brand that for many consumers stands for low carb,\u201d low sugar\u201d and protein rich\u201d nutrition. The Atkins philosophy focuses on a healthy nutritional approach with reduced levels of refined carbohydrates and refined sugars and encourages the consumption of lean protein, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and good fats.\nIn our core Atkins snacking business, we strive to offer a complete line of nutrition bars, ready-to-drink shakes and confections that satisfy hunger while providing consumers with a convenient, better-for-you\u201d snacking alternative. Our sales, marketing and R&D capabilities enable us to distribute products into a national customer base across the mass merchandiser, grocery and drug channels. We believe that Atkins' broad brand recognition, depth of management talent and strong cash generation position us to continue to innovate in the Atkins brand and acquire other brands, and thereby become an industry leading snacking platform. To that end, in December 2016, Atkins completed the acquisition of Wellness Foods, Inc. ( Wellness Foods\u201d), a Canada-based developer, marketer and seller of the SimplyProtein\u00ae brand that is focused on protein-rich and low-sugar products, which our management believes has significant opportunity for expansion in the U.S. In addition to snacking products, Atkins entered into a license arrangement in 2014 for frozen meals sold in the U.S. by Bellisio Foods, Inc.\nMatters Affecting Comparability\nThe Simply Good Foods Company ( Simply Good Foods\u201d) was formed on March 30, 2017 to consummate a business combination with NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. ( Atkins\u201d) and Conyers Park Acquisition Corp ( Conyers Park\u201d). Conyers Park, a special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC\u201d), was formed on April 20, 2016 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.\nOn April 10, 2017, Conyers Park and Atkins entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, Conyers Park and Atkins combined under a new holding company, Simply Good Foods, which was listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SMPL\u201d as of closing of the Business Combination.\nOn July 7, 2017 (the Closing Date\u201d) Simply Good Foods completed the business combination with Conyers Park and Atkins (the Business Combination\u201d). As a result, Simply Good Foods owns all of the equity in Atkins.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods is the acquirer for accounting purposes and the successor while Atkins is the acquiree and accounting predecessor. Our financial statement presentation includes the financial statements of Atkins as Predecessor\u201d for periods prior to the Closing Date and of Simply Good Foods for periods after the Closing Date, including the consolidation of Atkins. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we are obligated to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA\u201d). See Note 9, Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, for a detailed discussion of the TRA.\nFor convenience, we have also included pro forma combined information for the comparable periods of fiscal 2017 as if the Business Combination had been completed at the beginning of the 2017 fiscal year. References in this Annual Report to information provided on a pro forma basis refer to such pro forma combined financial information.\nOur Reportable Segment\nOur business is organized around one reportable segment based on our go-to-market strategies, the objectives of the business and how our chief decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.\nKey Financial Definitions\nNet sales.

The amounts presented represent the Predecessor's historical GAAP results of operations. \n ii. The adjustment represents a non-cash, one time inventory fair value adjustment recorded in conjunction with the Business Combination and was recognized in the successor period, and is not indicative of future cost of goods sold. \n iii. The adjustment represents the incremental stock-based compensation expense under the Simply Good Foods omnibus incentive plan. \n iv. The adjustment reflects the difference in the intangible asset amortization expense associated with the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets due to the Business Combination. The amortization expense decreased as additional indefinite lived intangible assets were identified for the successor entity than the predecessor entity. The amount of amortizable intangible assets identified in the Business Combination decreased from $125.8 million to $88.0 million. \n v. Business combination transaction expenses primarily consist of fees related to the Business Combination and the Company's acquisition activities. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination, of the consolidated financial statements for additional details. \n vi. Predecessor warrants were accounted for as warrant liabilities, which were exercised and settled with the Business Combination. \n vii. Represents the adjustment necessary to arrive at interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving debt facilities of Simply Good Foods. The predecessor entity had $337.2 million outstanding as of August 27, 2016 while the successor entity had $200.0 million outstanding. The long term debt of the predecessor entity accrued interest at 6.25% on the first lien and 9.75% on the second lien while the successor debt accrues interest at 3 month LIBOR plus 4%. The significant reduction in outstanding principal, and lower interest rates, drive significant expense savings. Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit, of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on long-term debt. \n viii. Represents the adjustment necessary to arrive at an effective income tax rate of 39.6%. \n ix. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Net sales of $431.4 million represented an increase of $35.3 million, or 8.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase in net sales is primarily due to organic sales growth of 8.3%, driven by increased sales of our products in the U.S., offset by 0.3% from the prior year recall receivable. In addition, the acquisition of Wellness Foods drove a 0.9% increase in net sales compared to the prior year.\nIn the third-quarter 10-Q the Company disclosed that it had historically recorded revenue on a FOB Shipping Point\u201d basis despite the fact that a significant portion of customer contracts indicated \"FOB Destination\" terms. As such, in the fourth quarter revenue was recorded on an \"FOB Destination\" basis, which resulted in a reduction to net sales of $7.8 million as of August 25, 2018.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased $13.9 million, or 6.6%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily due to sales volume growth of $16.5 million offset by an improvement in supply chain costs of $2.6 million.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased $21.3 million, or 11.5%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. Gross profit of $207.6 million, or 48.1% of net sales, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 increased 110 basis points from 47.0% of net sales for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily due to favorable changes in trade allowances and favorable supply chain costs, offset in part by the aforementioned recall reimbursement which had a 20 basis point benefit to gross margin in the previous year.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses increased $15.1 million, or 11.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 due to the following:\n \u2022 Distribution. Distribution expenses increased $1.9 million, or 10.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily driven by volume increases. \n \u2022 Selling. Selling expenses increased $1.6 million, or 9.7%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.1 million increase in customer-specific advertising activity, offset by broker savings of $0.5 million. \n \u2022 Marketing. Marketing expenses increased $3.1 million, or 8.1%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase in expense is primarily driven by an increase in media spending and production. \n \u2022 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $8.6 million, or 18.0%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is related to higher professional fees of $3.0 million, employee related cost of $2.3 million, expansion of our distribution center of $1.6 million, the acquisition of Wellness Foods of $0.7 million and other increases in general and administrative expense of $1.0 million. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses remained consistent between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 has been adjusted to change the depreciable basis of intangible assets as if the Business Combination occurred at the beginning of the year. \n \u2022 Business transaction costs. The Company recorded $2.3 million in transaction costs for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 primarily related to the equity offering by one of our stockholders in February and due diligence costs associated with acquisition efforts. The Company did not incur any transaction costs in the comparable period. \n \u2022 Gain in fair value change of contingent consideration - TRA liability. The Company recorded a $2.8 million gain in contingent consideration for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018. The gain is due to the change in the fair value of the TRA from the beneficial impact of the change in tax law offset by routine incremental fair value amortization changes. The TRA was entered into as part of the Business Combination in the prior year. The TRA is discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. \nInterest expense. Interest expense remained consistent between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 has been adjusted based on the long-term debt of the Company as if the Business Combination occurred at the beginning of the year.\nGain on foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gain decreased $0.5 million between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 and the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. Foreign currency transactions relate to changes in foreign currency rates in our international operations.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense. Income tax expense decreased $36.2 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The difference is primarily due to the preliminary assessment of the tax law change on the Company's tax liabilities. For the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017, the effective tax rate assumed within the pro forma financial statements was 39.6%. For the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018, a provisional gain of $31.0 million pursuant to the change in tax law resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 32.7%. The change in tax law is discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.1 million, or 8.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d below.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 27, 2016\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared from the perspective of Atkins and its fiscal year end of August 27, 2016. The unaudited pro forma income statement for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016 presents the historical consolidated statement of operations of Atkins for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016, giving effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on August 30, 2015.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements give effect to the Business Combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements also reflect the impact of the Atkins license arrangement for frozen meals sold in the U.S. by Bellisio. This agreement was effective September 1, 2016 and is a seven-year license with Bellisio to license Atkins' frozen meals business. Bellisio manufactures, distributes, markets, promotes and sells Atkins frozen food products under the Atkins licensed mark. The effects of the license agreement are presented in the Frozen License Adjustments\u201d and Atkins' Pro Forma\u201d columns in the unaudited historical consolidated statement of operations for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the Business Combination actually been completed sooner. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved if the Business Combination had been completed as of August 30, 2015.\nPro Forma Combined Statement of Operations\nFor the Pro Forma Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 27, 2016\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The amounts in this column represents the Predecessor's historical GAAP results after removing the results of operations of the Frozen operations. \n ii. The adjustment represents the incremental stock based compensation expense under the Simply Good Foods omnibus incentive plan. \n iii. The adjustment reflects the difference in the intangible asset amortization expense associated with the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets due to the Business Combination. The amortization expense decreased as more indefinite lived intangible assets were identified for the successor entity than the predecessor entity. The amount of amortizable intangible assets identified in the Business Combination decreased from $125.8 million to $88.0 million. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangibles, of the consolidated financial statements for additional details. \n iv. The Simply Good Foods warrants are not warrant liabilities and are accounted for as equity warrants. The adjustment represents the corresponding decrease to expense. \n v. The adjustment represents interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving debt facilities of Simply Good Foods. The predecessor entity had $337.2 million outstanding as of August 27, 2016 while the successor entity had $200.0 million outstanding. The long term debt of the predecessor entity accrued interest at 6.25% on the first lien and 9.75% on the second lien while the successor debt accrues interest at 3 month LIBOR and 4%. The significant reduction in outstanding principal, and lower interest rates, drive significant expense savings. Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on long-term debt. \n vi. Represents the effective income tax rate of 39.6%. \n vii. Approximately $2.1 million of Pro Forma Frozen Licensing Selling costs were previously classified as Pro Forma Frozen Licensing Distribution expenses. \nComparison of Results for the Pro Forma Combined Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 26, 2017 and the Supplemental Pro Forma Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 27, 2016\nFor comparative purposes, we are presenting a unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017, and we discuss such pro forma combined results compared to the supplemental unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016.

Net sales increased $27.1 million, or 7.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by growth of $20.0 million in Atkins core business and the December 2016 addition of Wellness Foods of $7.1 million. The growth in the core business net sales was primarily driven by increased demand, growing volume $17.4 million and improved returns of $2.6 million. The improvement to returns was principally due to the 2016 recall expense which decreased 2016 net sales. The recall was subsequently reimbursed in 2017.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased $10.5 million, or 5.2%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016. The increase was primarily due to sales volume growth of $6.9 million and the Wellness Foods acquisition of $3.6 million.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased $16.7 million, or 9.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. Gross margin of 47.0% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 improved 110 bps from 45.9% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016 due to the favorable recall expense, cost saving initiatives and favorable mix.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses increased $5.8 million, or 4.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 due to the following:\n \u2022 Selling. Selling expenses increased $0.2 million, or 1.0%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. \n \u2022 Marketing. Marketing expenses increased $1.9 million, or 5.3%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 to support the growth of the snacking business. \n \u2022 Distribution. Distribution expenses increased $2.3 million, or 14.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily driven by a one-time surcharge in 2017 of $0.8 million. \n \u2022 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase related to the acquisition of Wellness Foods and incremental costs associated with public company operations. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were flat for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. \n \u2022 Other expense. Other expenses decreased $0.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. \nGain (loss) on foreign currency transactions. Loss on foreign currency transactions increased $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased $4.9 million from the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The difference is due to higher income from operations in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $8.3 million, or 12.9%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase was driven by the increase in gross profit. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to exclude the following items: stock-based compensation and warrant expense, transaction and IPO readiness costs, restructuring costs, management fees, frozen media licensing fees, non-core legal costs, transactional exchange impact, change in fair value of contingent consideration - TRA liability, business transaction costs and other non-core expenses. The Company believes that the inclusion of these supplementary adjustments in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors and reflects operating results more accurately of the on-going operations. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in calculation.\nThe following unaudited tables below provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss).\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Resources\nOverview\nWe have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our principal uses for liquidity have been debt service and working capital. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we are incurring as a public company for at least the next twelve months.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, we are obligated to make payments under the TRA. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA will vary, the payments that we will be required to make could be significant. Any payments made under the TRA will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and accrue interest until paid. See Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information on the TRA.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nOn July 7, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties. The credit agreement provides for a term facility of $200.0 million ( Term Facility\u201d) with a seven year maturity and a revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a five year maturity, under the first lien senior secured loan facilities (the First Lien\u201d). Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the Business Combination, the full $200.0 million of the First Lien term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) was drawn. No amounts were originally drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate per annum is based on either (i) a base rate equaling the higher of (a) the prime rate\u201d, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) the Euro-currency rate applicable for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% plus (x) 3.00% margin for Term Loan or (y) 2.00% margin for Revolving Credit Facility, or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus (x) 4.00% margin for the Term Loan subject to a floor of 1.00% or (y) 3.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility was adjusted after the completion of the Company's first full fiscal quarter after the closing of the Business Combination based upon the Company's consolidated First Lien net leverage ratio. As security for the payment or performance of its debt, the Company has pledged certain equity interests in its subsidiaries.\nOn March 16, 2018 (the Amendment Date\u201d), the Company entered into an amendment (the Repricing Amendment\u201d) to the First Lien. As a result of the Repricing Amendment, the interest rate on the Term Loan was reduced and, as of the Amendment Date, such loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.50% or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%. The Repricing Amendment did not change the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will continue to bear interest based upon the Company's consolidated First Lien net leverage ratio as of the last financial statements delivered to the administrative agent. No additional debt was incurred, or any proceeds received, by the Company in connection with the Repricing Amendment. The incremental fees paid to the administrative agent are reflected as additional debt discount and are amortized over the terms of the long-term financing agreements using the effective-interest method.\nThe First Lien is subject to mandatory prepayments based on contractual terms.\nThe credit facilities governing our debt arrangements contain certain financial and other covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.25:1.00 (with a reduction to 6.00:1.00 on and after the third anniversary of the closing date of the credit facilities) contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the revolving credit facility, and limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. The credit facilities governing our debt arrangements bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow. As the Company has not drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 25, 2018 and August 26, 2017, no debt covenants were applicable as of the period then ended.\nAs of August 25, 2018, the outstanding principal balances of the Term Loan was $198.5 million, and no amounts were drawn under the $75.0 million Revolving Credit Facility.\nEquity Warrants\nOn October 4, 2018, the Company announced that it will redeem all of its public warrants to purchase common stock that remain outstanding immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2018 (the Redemption Date\u201d). Any public warrants that remain unexercised immediately after the Redemption Date will be redeemed at a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant. In addition, in accordance with the warrant agreement for the public warrants, the Company's Board of Directors elected to require that all future exercises of the public warrants be exercised on a cashless basis. Accordingly, holders may no longer exercise public warrants in exchange for payment in cash of the $11.50 per share exercise price. Instead, a holder exercising a public warrant will be deemed to pay the $11.50 per share exercise price by the surrender of 0.61885 of a share of common stock that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon a cash exercise of each public warrant. Accordingly, by virtue of the cashless exercise of the public warrants, exercising holders of public warrants will receive 0.38115 of a share of the Company's common stock for each public warrant surrendered for exercise.\nFrom August 26, 2018 through October 4, 2018, public warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,886,663 shares of the Company's common stock were exercised for cash at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $113.7 million.\nThe Company's private warrants to purchase 6,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock remain outstanding as of the date of this report.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52-Weeks Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>From July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>From August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52-Weeks Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 25, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 27, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Successor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Successor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Predecessor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Predecessor)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(197,304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,458\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(815\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in (provided by) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $61.0 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, an increase of $88.4 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $27.4 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher income before taxes. The Company had $112.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of August 25, 2018, which is sufficient to satisfy current liabilities, current maturities of long-term debt and the interest payments associated with them.\nOur net cash used in operating activities was $27.4 million for the successor period ending August 26, 2017, a decrease of $49.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $21.9 million for the predecessor period ending July 6, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the transaction related expenses in the successor period offset by higher net income of approximately $2.9 million.\nInvesting activities. Our net cash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, which was a decrease of $193.8 million compared to the investing activities for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The change was due to the Business Combination in the successor period ended August 26, 2017, offset by minor increases in purchases of property and equipment .\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $197.3 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017, which was an increase in cash used of $176.8 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $20.5 million for the predecessor period. The large increase was due to the net exchange of cash in the Business Combination in the successor period of $196.8 million compared to the purchase of Wellness Foods for approximately $20.0 million (net of cash acquired) in December 2016 (predecessor period).\nFinancing activities. Our net cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $280.8 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The decrease is due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $191.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of equity of $97.0 million related to the Business Combination in the successor period ended August 26, 2017.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $280.8 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017, an increase of cash provided of $334.3 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $53.5 million for the predecessor period. This increase in cash provided was due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $191.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of equity of $97.0 million related to the Business Combination in the successor period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 25, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, income or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our expected material contractual payment obligations as of August 25, 2018.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) As of August 25, 2018, the Company is obligated under multiple non-cancellable operating leases, which continue through 2023. Rent expenses, inclusive of real estate taxes, utilities and maintenance incurred under operating leases, are included in General and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Rent expenses were $2.4 million for fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018, $0.3 million for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017, $1.7 million for the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017, respectively. \nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing; however, the following discussion pertains to accounting policies the Company believes are most critical to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.\nBusiness Combinations\nAs discussed in detail in Note 3, Business Combination, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing, on July 7, 2017, Simply Good Foods acquired the Atkins business from Roark. The Business Combination was funded through a combination of cash, stock and debt financing.\nThe Business Combination is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nASC 805, Business Combinations, establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has historically recognized revenue at the time of shipment to its customers; however, upon examination of certain contractual arrangements, and as a result of the practice of refunding customers for products damaged in-transit, the risks and rewards of ownership of the products transferred at customer receipt. Accordingly, the Company concluded it should have recognized revenue upon customer receipt. These errors, along with the errors in prior annual and quarterly periods for which revenue for sales-in-transit was not appropriately deferred, are not material to the financial statements.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company deferred all revenue for shipments in-transit to customers totaling $7.8 million. The failure to defer revenues for sales-in-transit in the third quarter of 2018, resulted in an understatement of net sales of $8.2 million for revenue that was recorded in the third quarter that should have been deferred and recognized during the fourth quarter upon customer receipt.\nTrade Promotions\nThe Company offers trade promotions through various programs to customers and consumers. Trade promotions include discounts, rebates, slotting and other marketing activities. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the later of the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires management to make estimates regarding the volume of incentive that will be redeemed and their total cost. These estimates are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities, as well as the Company's best estimated of current activity.\nAt August 25, 2018 and August 26, 2017, the allowance for trade promotions was $7.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. These differences have historically been insignificant.\nTax Receivable Arrangement\nAs discussed in Note 3, Business Combination, and Note 9, Income Taxes, simultaneously with the closing of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA\u201d). The TRA is contingent consideration and included as part of the consideration transferred in the Business Combination. The Tax Receivable Agreement obligation was recorded at its acquisition-date fair value at inception and is classified as a liability. The Tax Receivable Agreement will generally provide for the payment by Simply\nGood Foods to the Selling Equity holders for certain federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax benefits deemed realized in post-closing taxable periods by Simply Good Foods, Conyers Park, Atkins and Atkins eligible subsidiaries from the use of up to $100 million of the following tax attributes: (i) net operating losses available to be carried forward as of the closing of the Business Combination; (ii) certain deductions generated by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) remaining depreciable tax basis from the 2003 acquisition of Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. As of August 25, 2018, the estimated fair value of these contingent payments is $27.5 million, which has been recorded as a liability and represents 100% of the value of the recorded tax attributes. Subsequent changes in fair value of the contingent liability will be recognized in earnings.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicated that potential impairment may be present. Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by performing either qualitative or quantitative assessments. In the qualitative assessment, factors including macro-economic conditions, industry and company-specific factors, legal and regulatory environments and historical company performance are evaluated in assessing fair value. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. When using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a impairment charge for the differential.\nQualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were performed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Based on the results of assessment, it was determined that it is more likely than not the reporting unit had a fair value in excess of carrying value. Accordingly, no further impairment testing was completed and no impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles were recognized during the fiscal periods ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 or August 27, 2016.\nThe Company also has intangible assets that are expected to have determinable useful lives, consisting primarily of trademarks, customer relationships and licensing agreements. Costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the fiscal periods ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 or August 27, 2016 there were no impairments recorded related to finite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nIncome taxes include federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing for further information regarding recently issued accounting standards.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding the Company's expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nAtkins fiscal year ends the last Saturday in August. Atkins' fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 and August 27, 2016, respectively, and were each fifty-two week periods. Atkins' fiscal quarters are comprised of 13 weeks each, except for fifty-three week fiscal periods for the which the fourth quarter will be comprised of fourteen weeks, and end on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter (fourteenth Saturday of the fourth quarter, when applicable). Atkins' fiscal quarters for fiscal 2018 ended on November 24, 2017, February 24, 2018, May 26, 2018 and August 25, 2018.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, information is presented for the successor period for the fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018, the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017, the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017 and the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 are derived from Atkins' audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nOverview\nSimply Good Foods is a developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional foods and snacking products. Our highly-focused product portfolio consists primarily of nutrition bars, RTD shakes, snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins\u00ae, SimplyProtein\u00ae, Atkins Harvest Trail and Atkins Endulge\u00ae brand names. Over the past 45 years, Atkins has become an iconic American brand that for many consumers stands for low carb,\u201d low sugar\u201d and protein rich\u201d nutrition. The Atkins philosophy focuses on a healthy nutritional approach with reduced levels of refined carbohydrates and refined sugars and encourages the consumption of lean protein, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and good fats.\nIn our core Atkins snacking business, we strive to offer a complete line of nutrition bars, ready-to-drink shakes and confections that satisfy hunger while providing consumers with a convenient, better-for-you\u201d snacking alternative. Our sales, marketing and R&D capabilities enable us to distribute products into a national customer base across the mass merchandiser, grocery and drug channels. We believe that Atkins' broad brand recognition, depth of management talent and strong cash generation position us to continue to innovate in the Atkins brand and acquire other brands, and thereby become an industry leading snacking platform. To that end, in December 2016, Atkins completed the acquisition of Wellness Foods, Inc. ( Wellness Foods\u201d), a Canada-based developer, marketer and seller of the SimplyProtein\u00ae brand that is focused on protein-rich and low-sugar products, which our management believes has significant opportunity for expansion in the U.S. In addition to snacking products, Atkins entered into a license arrangement in 2014 for frozen meals sold in the U.S. by Bellisio Foods, Inc.\nMatters Affecting Comparability\nThe Simply Good Foods Company ( Simply Good Foods\u201d) was formed on March 30, 2017 to consummate a business combination with NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. ( Atkins\u201d) and Conyers Park Acquisition Corp ( Conyers Park\u201d). Conyers Park, a special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC\u201d), was formed on April 20, 2016 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.\nOn April 10, 2017, Conyers Park and Atkins entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, Conyers Park and Atkins combined under a new holding company, Simply Good Foods, which was listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SMPL\u201d as of closing of the Business Combination.\nOn July 7, 2017 (the Closing Date\u201d) Simply Good Foods completed the business combination with Conyers Park and Atkins (the Business Combination\u201d). As a result, Simply Good Foods owns all of the equity in Atkins.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods is the acquirer for accounting purposes and the successor while Atkins is the acquiree and accounting predecessor. Our financial statement presentation includes the financial statements of Atkins as Predecessor\u201d for periods prior to the Closing Date and of Simply Good Foods for periods after the Closing Date, including the consolidation of Atkins. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we are obligated to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA\u201d). See Note 9, Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, for a detailed discussion of the TRA.\nFor convenience, we have also included pro forma combined information for the comparable periods of fiscal 2017 as if the Business Combination had been completed at the beginning of the 2017 fiscal year. References in this Annual Report to information provided on a pro forma basis refer to such pro forma combined financial information.\nOur Reportable Segment\nOur business is organized around one reportable segment based on our go-to-market strategies, the objectives of the business and how our chief decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.\nKey Financial Definitions\nNet sales.

Operating expenses for the successor fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018 were $142.8 million, or 33.1% of net sales, compared to $18.5 million, or 32.9% of net sales, for the Successor Period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the successor fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018 was $12.6 million, or 2.9% of net sales, compared to $1.7 million, or 3.0% of net sales, for the Successor Period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense. Income tax benefit for the successor fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018 was $17.4 million compared to income tax expense of $0.3 million for the Successor Period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the successor fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018 was $78.6 million compared to $8.7 million for the Successor Period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017.\nComparison of Results for the Successor Period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 and the Predecessor Period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017.\nNet sales. Net sales for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 were $56.3 million compared to $339.8 million for the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017. There was no impact to net sales as a result of the Business Combination.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 were $35.9 million compared to $180.0 million for the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017. As a result of the Business Combination, there was a one-time inventory fair value step-up of $6.0 million that was charged to cost of goods sold in the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017.\nGross profit. Gross profit for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017, including the effect of the one-time inventory fair value step-up, were $20.4 million, or 36.2% of net sales, compared to the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017, gross profit was $159.8 million, or 47.0% of net sales.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 were $18.5 million or 32.9% of net sales compared to $136.1 million or 40.1% of net sales the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017.\nInterest expense.

The lower interest expense in the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 is the result of the reduced principal balance of the debt as well as a reduction in the rate of interest being incurred on the debt.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 was $0.3 million compared to $4.6 million for the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017. Higher taxes in the predecessor period relate to the impacts of the nondeductible business combination transaction costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $55.2 million or 86.5% for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017 compared to the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d.\nPro Forma Combined Fifty-Two Weeks Ended August 26, 2017\nFor comparative purposes, we are presenting an unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017, and we discuss such pro forma combined results compared to the Predecessor's full year 2016 results below. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2017 presents our consolidated results of operations giving pro forma effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred as of August 28, 2016. The pro forma combined adjustments are based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma combined basis, the impact of these transactions on the historical financial information of our Predecessor and Successor entities, as applicable.\nThe Business Combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information contains a variety of adjustments, assumptions and estimates, is subject to numerous other uncertainties and the assumptions and adjustments as described in the accompanying notes hereto and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our results of operations had the Business Combination occurred on August 28, 2016. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information also does not project our results of operations for any future period or date. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 includes results of the Successor and Predecessor entities. The pro forma combined adjustments give effect to the items identified in the pro forma combined table below in connection with the Business Combination.\nPro Forma Combined Statement of Operations\nFor the Pro Forma Combined Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 26, 2017\n\n_______________\n i. The amounts presented represent the Predecessor's historical GAAP results of operations. \n ii. The adjustment represents a non-cash, one time inventory fair value adjustment recorded in conjunction with the Business Combination and was recognized in the successor period, and is not indicative of future cost of goods sold. \n iii. The adjustment represents the incremental stock-based compensation expense under the Simply Good Foods omnibus incentive plan. \n iv. The adjustment reflects the difference in the intangible asset amortization expense associated with the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets due to the Business Combination. The amortization expense decreased as additional indefinite lived intangible assets were identified for the successor entity than the predecessor entity. The amount of amortizable intangible assets identified in the Business Combination decreased from $125.8 million to $88.0 million. \n v. Business combination transaction expenses primarily consist of fees related to the Business Combination and the Company's acquisition activities. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination, of the consolidated financial statements for additional details. \n vi. Predecessor warrants were accounted for as warrant liabilities, which were exercised and settled with the Business Combination. \n vii. Represents the adjustment necessary to arrive at interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving debt facilities of Simply Good Foods. The predecessor entity had $337.2 million outstanding as of August 27, 2016 while the successor entity had $200.0 million outstanding. The long term debt of the predecessor entity accrued interest at 6.25% on the first lien and 9.75% on the second lien while the successor debt accrues interest at 3 month LIBOR plus 4%. The significant reduction in outstanding principal, and lower interest rates, drive significant expense savings. Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit, of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on long-term debt. \n viii. Represents the adjustment necessary to arrive at an effective income tax rate of 39.6%. \n ix. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d within this section. \nComparison of Results for the Fifty-Two Weeks Ended August 25, 2018 and the Pro Forma Combined Fifty-Two Weeks Ended August 26, 2017\nFor comparative purposes, we are presenting a statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018, compared to unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected information from our unaudited pro forma combined financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales:\n\nNet sales. Net sales of $431.4 million represented an increase of $35.3 million, or 8.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase in net sales is primarily due to organic sales growth of 8.3%, driven by increased sales of our products in the U.S., offset by 0.3% from the prior year recall receivable. In addition, the acquisition of Wellness Foods drove a 0.9% increase in net sales compared to the prior year.\nIn the third-quarter 10-Q the Company disclosed that it had historically recorded revenue on a FOB Shipping Point\u201d basis despite the fact that a significant portion of customer contracts indicated \"FOB Destination\" terms. As such, in the fourth quarter revenue was recorded on an \"FOB Destination\" basis, which resulted in a reduction to net sales of $7.8 million as of August 25, 2018.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased $13.9 million, or 6.6%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily due to sales volume growth of $16.5 million offset by an improvement in supply chain costs of $2.6 million.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased $21.3 million, or 11.5%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. Gross profit of $207.6 million, or 48.1% of net sales, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 increased 110 basis points from 47.0% of net sales for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily due to favorable changes in trade allowances and favorable supply chain costs, offset in part by the aforementioned recall reimbursement which had a 20 basis point benefit to gross margin in the previous year.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses increased $15.1 million, or 11.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 due to the following:\n \u2022 Distribution. Distribution expenses increased $1.9 million, or 10.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is primarily driven by volume increases. \n \u2022 Selling. Selling expenses increased $1.6 million, or 9.7%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.1 million increase in customer-specific advertising activity, offset by broker savings of $0.5 million. \n \u2022 Marketing. Marketing expenses increased $3.1 million, or 8.1%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase in expense is primarily driven by an increase in media spending and production. \n \u2022 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $8.6 million, or 18.0%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is related to higher professional fees of $3.0 million, employee related cost of $2.3 million, expansion of our distribution center of $1.6 million, the acquisition of Wellness Foods of $0.7 million and other increases in general and administrative expense of $1.0 million. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses remained consistent between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 has been adjusted to change the depreciable basis of intangible assets as if the Business Combination occurred at the beginning of the year. \n \u2022 Business transaction costs. The Company recorded $2.3 million in transaction costs for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 primarily related to the equity offering by one of our stockholders in February and due diligence costs associated with acquisition efforts. The Company did not incur any transaction costs in the comparable period. \n \u2022 Gain in fair value change of contingent consideration - TRA liability. The Company recorded a $2.8 million gain in contingent consideration for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018. The gain is due to the change in the fair value of the TRA from the beneficial impact of the change in tax law offset by routine incremental fair value amortization changes. The TRA was entered into as part of the Business Combination in the prior year. The TRA is discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. \nInterest expense. Interest expense remained consistent between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 has been adjusted based on the long-term debt of the Company as if the Business Combination occurred at the beginning of the year.\nGain on foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency gain decreased $0.5 million between the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 and the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. Foreign currency transactions relate to changes in foreign currency rates in our international operations.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense. Income tax expense decreased $36.2 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The difference is primarily due to the preliminary assessment of the tax law change on the Company's tax liabilities. For the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017, the effective tax rate assumed within the pro forma financial statements was 39.6%. For the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018, a provisional gain of $31.0 million pursuant to the change in tax law resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 32.7%. The change in tax law is discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.1 million, or 8.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 25, 2018 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017. The increase is due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d below.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 27, 2016\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared from the perspective of Atkins and its fiscal year end of August 27, 2016. The unaudited pro forma income statement for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016 presents the historical consolidated statement of operations of Atkins for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016, giving effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on August 30, 2015.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements give effect to the Business Combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements also reflect the impact of the Atkins license arrangement for frozen meals sold in the U.S. by Bellisio. This agreement was effective September 1, 2016 and is a seven-year license with Bellisio to license Atkins' frozen meals business. Bellisio manufactures, distributes, markets, promotes and sells Atkins frozen food products under the Atkins licensed mark. The effects of the license agreement are presented in the Frozen License Adjustments\u201d and Atkins' Pro Forma\u201d columns in the unaudited historical consolidated statement of operations for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the Business Combination actually been completed sooner. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved if the Business Combination had been completed as of August 30, 2015.\nPro Forma Combined Statement of Operations\nFor the Pro Forma Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 27, 2016\n\n_______________\n i. The amounts in this column represents the Predecessor's historical GAAP results after removing the results of operations of the Frozen operations. \n ii. The adjustment represents the incremental stock based compensation expense under the Simply Good Foods omnibus incentive plan. \n iii. The adjustment reflects the difference in the intangible asset amortization expense associated with the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets due to the Business Combination. The amortization expense decreased as more indefinite lived intangible assets were identified for the successor entity than the predecessor entity. The amount of amortizable intangible assets identified in the Business Combination decreased from $125.8 million to $88.0 million. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangibles, of the consolidated financial statements for additional details. \n iv. The Simply Good Foods warrants are not warrant liabilities and are accounted for as equity warrants. The adjustment represents the corresponding decrease to expense. \n v. The adjustment represents interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving debt facilities of Simply Good Foods. The predecessor entity had $337.2 million outstanding as of August 27, 2016 while the successor entity had $200.0 million outstanding. The long term debt of the predecessor entity accrued interest at 6.25% on the first lien and 9.75% on the second lien while the successor debt accrues interest at 3 month LIBOR and 4%. The significant reduction in outstanding principal, and lower interest rates, drive significant expense savings. Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on long-term debt. \n vi. Represents the effective income tax rate of 39.6%. \n vii. Approximately $2.1 million of Pro Forma Frozen Licensing Selling costs were previously classified as Pro Forma Frozen Licensing Distribution expenses. \nComparison of Results for the Pro Forma Combined Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 26, 2017 and the Supplemental Pro Forma Fifty-Two Week Period Ended August 27, 2016\nFor comparative purposes, we are presenting a unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017, and we discuss such pro forma combined results compared to the supplemental unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected information from our unaudited pro forma consolidated financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales:\n\nNet sales. Net sales increased $27.1 million, or 7.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by growth of $20.0 million in Atkins core business and the December 2016 addition of Wellness Foods of $7.1 million. The growth in the core business net sales was primarily driven by increased demand, growing volume $17.4 million and improved returns of $2.6 million. The improvement to returns was principally due to the 2016 recall expense which decreased 2016 net sales. The recall was subsequently reimbursed in 2017.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased $10.5 million, or 5.2%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016. The increase was primarily due to sales volume growth of $6.9 million and the Wellness Foods acquisition of $3.6 million.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased $16.7 million, or 9.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. Gross margin of 47.0% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2017 improved 110 bps from 45.9% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 27, 2016 due to the favorable recall expense, cost saving initiatives and favorable mix.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses increased $5.8 million, or 4.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 due to the following:\n \u2022 Selling. Selling expenses increased $0.2 million, or 1.0%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. \n \u2022 Marketing. Marketing expenses increased $1.9 million, or 5.3%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016 to support the growth of the snacking business. \n \u2022 Distribution. Distribution expenses increased $2.3 million, or 14.8%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily driven by a one-time surcharge in 2017 of $0.8 million. \n \u2022 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase related to the acquisition of Wellness Foods and incremental costs associated with public company operations. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were flat for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. \n \u2022 Other expense. Other expenses decreased $0.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. \nGain (loss) on foreign currency transactions. Loss on foreign currency transactions increased $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased $4.9 million from the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The difference is due to higher income from operations in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $8.3 million, or 12.9%, for the fifty-two week period ended August 26, 2017 compared to the fifty-two week period ended August 27, 2016. The increase was driven by the increase in gross profit. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\u201d.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to exclude the following items: stock-based compensation and warrant expense, transaction and IPO readiness costs, restructuring costs, management fees, frozen media licensing fees, non-core legal costs, transactional exchange impact, change in fair value of contingent consideration - TRA liability, business transaction costs and other non-core expenses. The Company believes that the inclusion of these supplementary adjustments in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors and reflects operating results more accurately of the on-going operations. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in calculation.\nThe following unaudited tables below provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss).\n\n_______________\n (1) Other items consist principally of exchange impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our principal uses for liquidity have been debt service and working capital. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we are incurring as a public company for at least the next twelve months.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, we are obligated to make payments under the TRA. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA will vary, the payments that we will be required to make could be significant. Any payments made under the TRA will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and accrue interest until paid. See Note 9, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information on the TRA.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nOn July 7, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties. The credit agreement provides for a term facility of $200.0 million ( Term Facility\u201d) with a seven year maturity and a revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a five year maturity, under the first lien senior secured loan facilities (the First Lien\u201d). Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the Business Combination, the full $200.0 million of the First Lien term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) was drawn. No amounts were originally drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate per annum is based on either (i) a base rate equaling the higher of (a) the prime rate\u201d, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) the Euro-currency rate applicable for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% plus (x) 3.00% margin for Term Loan or (y) 2.00% margin for Revolving Credit Facility, or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus (x) 4.00% margin for the Term Loan subject to a floor of 1.00% or (y) 3.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for Revolving Credit Facility was adjusted after the completion of the Company's first full fiscal quarter after the closing of the Business Combination based upon the Company's consolidated First Lien net leverage ratio. As security for the payment or performance of its debt, the Company has pledged certain equity interests in its subsidiaries.\nOn March 16, 2018 (the Amendment Date\u201d), the Company entered into an amendment (the Repricing Amendment\u201d) to the First Lien. As a result of the Repricing Amendment, the interest rate on the Term Loan was reduced and, as of the Amendment Date, such loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.50% or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%. The Repricing Amendment did not change the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will continue to bear interest based upon the Company's consolidated First Lien net leverage ratio as of the last financial statements delivered to the administrative agent. No additional debt was incurred, or any proceeds received, by the Company in connection with the Repricing Amendment. The incremental fees paid to the administrative agent are reflected as additional debt discount and are amortized over the terms of the long-term financing agreements using the effective-interest method.\nThe First Lien is subject to mandatory prepayments based on contractual terms.\nThe credit facilities governing our debt arrangements contain certain financial and other covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.25:1.00 (with a reduction to 6.00:1.00 on and after the third anniversary of the closing date of the credit facilities) contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the revolving credit facility, and limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. The credit facilities governing our debt arrangements bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow. As the Company has not drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 25, 2018 and August 26, 2017, no debt covenants were applicable as of the period then ended.\nAs of August 25, 2018, the outstanding principal balances of the Term Loan was $198.5 million, and no amounts were drawn under the $75.0 million Revolving Credit Facility.\nEquity Warrants\nOn October 4, 2018, the Company announced that it will redeem all of its public warrants to purchase common stock that remain outstanding immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2018 (the Redemption Date\u201d). Any public warrants that remain unexercised immediately after the Redemption Date will be redeemed at a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant. In addition, in accordance with the warrant agreement for the public warrants, the Company's Board of Directors elected to require that all future exercises of the public warrants be exercised on a cashless basis. Accordingly, holders may no longer exercise public warrants in exchange for payment in cash of the $11.50 per share exercise price. Instead, a holder exercising a public warrant will be deemed to pay the $11.50 per share exercise price by the surrender of 0.61885 of a share of common stock that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon a cash exercise of each public warrant. Accordingly, by virtue of the cashless exercise of the public warrants, exercising holders of public warrants will receive 0.38115 of a share of the Company's common stock for each public warrant surrendered for exercise.\nFrom August 26, 2018 through October 4, 2018, public warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,886,663 shares of the Company's common stock were exercised for cash at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $113.7 million.\nThe Company's private warrants to purchase 6,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock remain outstanding as of the date of this report.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):\n\nOperating activities. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $61.0 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, an increase of $88.4 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $27.4 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher income before taxes. The Company had $112.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of August 25, 2018, which is sufficient to satisfy current liabilities, current maturities of long-term debt and the interest payments associated with them.\nOur net cash used in operating activities was $27.4 million for the successor period ending August 26, 2017, a decrease of $49.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $21.9 million for the predecessor period ending July 6, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the transaction related expenses in the successor period offset by higher net income of approximately $2.9 million.\nInvesting activities. Our net cash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, which was a decrease of $193.8 million compared to the investing activities for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The change was due to the Business Combination in the successor period ended August 26, 2017, offset by minor increases in purchases of property and equipment .\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $197.3 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017, which was an increase in cash used of $176.8 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $20.5 million for the predecessor period. The large increase was due to the net exchange of cash in the Business Combination in the successor period of $196.8 million compared to the purchase of Wellness Foods for approximately $20.0 million (net of cash acquired) in December 2016 (predecessor period).\nFinancing activities. Our net cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million for the successor period ended August 25, 2018, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $280.8 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017. The decrease is due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $191.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of equity of $97.0 million related to the Business Combination in the successor period ended August 26, 2017.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $280.8 million for the successor period ended August 26, 2017, an increase of cash provided of $334.3 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $53.5 million for the predecessor period. This increase in cash provided was due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $191.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of equity of $97.0 million related to the Business Combination in the successor period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 25, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, income or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our expected material contractual payment obligations as of August 25, 2018.\n\n_______________\n (1) As of August 25, 2018, the Company is obligated under multiple non-cancellable operating leases, which continue through 2023. Rent expenses, inclusive of real estate taxes, utilities and maintenance incurred under operating leases, are included in General and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Rent expenses were $2.4 million for fifty-two week period ended August 25, 2018, $0.3 million for the successor period from July 7, 2017 through August 26, 2017, $1.7 million for the predecessor period from August 28, 2016 through July 6, 2017, respectively. \nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing; however, the following discussion pertains to accounting policies the Company believes are most critical to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.\nBusiness Combinations\nAs discussed in detail in Note 3, Business Combination, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing, on July 7, 2017, Simply Good Foods acquired the Atkins business from Roark. The Business Combination was funded through a combination of cash, stock and debt financing.\nThe Business Combination is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nASC 805, Business Combinations, establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has historically recognized revenue at the time of shipment to its customers; however, upon examination of certain contractual arrangements, and as a result of the practice of refunding customers for products damaged in-transit, the risks and rewards of ownership of the products transferred at customer receipt. Accordingly, the Company concluded it should have recognized revenue upon customer receipt. These errors, along with the errors in prior annual and quarterly periods for which revenue for sales-in-transit was not appropriately deferred, are not material to the financial statements.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company deferred all revenue for shipments in-transit to customers totaling $7.8 million. The failure to defer revenues for sales-in-transit in the third quarter of 2018, resulted in an understatement of net sales of $8.2 million for revenue that was recorded in the third quarter that should have been deferred and recognized during the fourth quarter upon customer receipt.\nTrade Promotions\nThe Company offers trade promotions through various programs to customers and consumers. Trade promotions include discounts, rebates, slotting and other marketing activities. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the later of the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires management to make estimates regarding the volume of incentive that will be redeemed and their total cost. These estimates are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities, as well as the Company's best estimated of current activity.\nAt August 25, 2018 and August 26, 2017, the allowance for trade promotions was $7.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. These differences have historically been insignificant.\nTax Receivable Arrangement\nAs discussed in Note 3, Business Combination, and Note 9, Income Taxes, simultaneously with the closing of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA\u201d). The TRA is contingent consideration and included as part of the consideration transferred in the Business Combination. The Tax Receivable Agreement obligation was recorded at its acquisition-date fair value at inception and is classified as a liability. The Tax Receivable Agreement will generally provide for the payment by Simply\nGood Foods to the Selling Equity holders for certain federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax benefits deemed realized in post-closing taxable periods by Simply Good Foods, Conyers Park, Atkins and Atkins eligible subsidiaries from the use of up to $100 million of the following tax attributes: (i) net operating losses available to be carried forward as of the closing of the Business Combination; (ii) certain deductions generated by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) remaining depreciable tax basis from the 2003 acquisition of Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. As of August 25, 2018, the estimated fair value of these contingent payments is $27.5 million, which has been recorded as a liability and represents 100% of the value of the recorded tax attributes. Subsequent changes in fair value of the contingent liability will be recognized in earnings.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicated that potential impairment may be present. Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by performing either qualitative or quantitative assessments. In the qualitative assessment, factors including macro-economic conditions, industry and company-specific factors, legal and regulatory environments and historical company performance are evaluated in assessing fair value. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. When using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a impairment charge for the differential.\nQualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were performed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Based on the results of assessment, it was determined that it is more likely than not the reporting unit had a fair value in excess of carrying value. Accordingly, no further impairment testing was completed and no impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles were recognized during the fiscal periods ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 or August 27, 2016.\nThe Company also has intangible assets that are expected to have determinable useful lives, consisting primarily of trademarks, customer relationships and licensing agreements. Costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the fiscal periods ended August 25, 2018, August 26, 2017 or August 27, 2016 there were no impairments recorded related to finite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nIncome taxes include federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting

$431.4 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to pro forma fiscal 2017. The increase was driven by organic sales growth and the acquisition of Wellness Foods.\n\n- Gross margin improved to 48.1% in fiscal 2018 from 47.0% in pro forma fiscal 2017 due to favorable changes in trade allowances and supply chain costs. \n\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.1% in fiscal 2018 from 32.2% in pro forma fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher general and administrative costs.\n\n- Net income increased significantly to $70.5 million in fiscal 2018 from $28.7 million in pro forma fiscal 2017, primarily due to a large tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the change in tax law.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4% to $78.6 million in fiscal 2018 from $72.5 million in pro forma fiscal 2017, driven by higher gross profit.\n\n- As of August 2018, the company had $112 million in cash and cash equivalents and $198.5 million in outstanding debt under its term loan facility. \n\nIn summary, the company showed strong sales growth and margin expansion in fiscal 2018, aided by tax reform benefits. The financial position remains healthy with positive operating cash flow and available liquidity."}
