Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of The National Security Group, Inc. (referred to in this document as \"we\", \"our\", \"us\", \"Company\" or \"NSEC\") and its subsidiaries. We are a smaller reporting company\u201d under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and therefore qualify for the scaled disclosure of smaller reporting companies. In general, the same information is required to be disclosed in the management discussion and analysis by smaller reporting companies except that the discussion need only cover the latest two year period and disclosures relating to contractual obligations are not required. In accordance with the scaled disclosure requirements, the following discussion generally covers the change in financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which accompany this report. Please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on page 4 of this report.\nThe National Security Group, Inc. operates in ten states with 64.2% of total premium revenue generated in the states of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. We operate in two business segments summarized as follows:\n\u2022The Property and Casualty (P&C) segment is the most significant segment, accounting for 91.5% of gross earned premium in 2020. The P&C segment operates in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\u2022The Life segment accounted for 8.5% of gross premium revenue in 2020. The Life segment is licensed to underwrite life and accident and health insurance in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\nThe P&C segment operations are conducted through National Security Fire & Casualty Company (NSFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1959, and Omega One Insurance Company (Omega), a wholly owned subsidiary of NSFC organized in 1992. Omega produces no direct written premium and is authorized to underwrite lines of business similar to NSFC; therefore, all references to NSFC or P&C segment in the remainder of this discussion will include the insurance operations of both NSFC and Omega.\nThe Life segment operations are conducted through National Security Insurance Company (NSIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1947. All references to NSIC or life segment in the remainder of this management discussion and analysis will refer to the combined life, accident and health insurance operations.\nOur income is principally derived from net underwriting profits and investment income. Net underwriting profit is principally derived from earned premiums received less claims paid, sales commissions to agents, costs of underwriting and insurance taxes and fees. Investment income includes interest and dividend income and gains and losses on investment holdings.\nAll of the insurance subsidiaries are Alabama domiciled insurance companies; therefore, the Alabama Department of Insurance is the primary insurance regulator. However, each subsidiary is subject to regulation by the respective insurance regulators of each state in which it is licensed to transact business. Insurance rates charged by each of the insurance subsidiaries are typically subject to review and approval by the insurance department for the respective state in which the rates will apply.\nAll of our insurance companies have been assigned ratings by A.M. Best Co (Best). On April 21, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) of \"bbb\" of NSFC. In addition, A.M. Best affirmed the FSR of B+ (Good) and Long-Term ICR of \"bbb-\" of Omega. The A.M. Best outlook for the ratings is \"stable\" for NSFC and Omega. A.M. Best upgraded the FSR to B++ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR to \"bbb\" for NSIC. The outlook for the ratings of NSIC is \"stable\". A.M. Best also affirmed the Long-Term ICR of \"bb\" of the parent holding company, NSEC, with a \"stable\" outlook.\nThe property and casualty subsidiaries have been assigned ratings by Demotech, Inc. On December 12, 2020, Demotech affirmed a Financial Stability Rating of A (Exceptional) for both NSFC and Omega.\nThe earnings in the property and casualty segment have seasonal volatility due to severe storm activity resulting in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses from hurricane, tornado, wind and hail related insurance claims. These storm systems or other natural disasters are classified as catastrophes (referred to as \"catastrophe\" or \"cat\" events/losses throughout the remainder of this document) by Property Claim Service (PCS) when an individual event causes $25 million or more in industry wide direct insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers.\nA primary process utilized by management to review financial performance is evaluating the operating performance of each segment before intercompany eliminations. By performing the evaluation in this manner, management can better assess the profitability of each segment on a standalone basis. To provide information similar to that utilized by management, industry segment information presented in this discussion is presented on a pretax basis by segment before eliminations. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K contains a reconciliation of the net income by segment to consolidated net income.\nIn order to present information as analyzed by Company management, the P&C segment combined ratio in this Management Discussion and Analysis is presented before certain intercompany eliminations. These intercompany eliminations, which are presented in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily include management and service fees paid by each subsidiary to NSEC, along with fees and expenses of the Company's employee claims adjusters. Claims adjusters are employees of NSIC but provide claim adjustment services to NSFC at rates comparable to those paid to independent (non-employee) adjusters utilized by NSFC. Management believes that the analysis of the P&C segment combined ratio prior to elimination of the intercompany transactions provides a more realistic view of performance and is consistent with our internal evaluation of operating performance.\nInformation in this discussion is presented in whole dollars rounded to the nearest thousand, except for per share information. Tabular amounts are presented in thousands.\nSummary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8,619,000, $3.41 loss per share, compared to a net income of $4,067,000, $1.61 income per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year to date pretax loss from operations, in 2020, totaled $12,641,000 compared to a pretax income from operations of $1,525,000 in 2019. The primary reason for the significant loss in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was a $15,332,000 increase in policyholder benefits; primarily driven by a significant increase in catastrophe claims in the P&C segment. Results for 2020 were also impacted by investment gains of $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 in 2019.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had insured claims (net of reinsurance recoveries) totaling $53,930,000 compared to $38,598,000 for the same period last year. The P&C segment was the primary source of this increase with claims up $15,446,000 in 2020, compared to 2019. The primary component of this increase was claims reported from catastrophe events which increased $17,573,000, in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had investment gains of $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $1,432,000. The primary reason for the investment gains in 2020 was a $1,361,000 gain on fixed maturities. In 2019, we had a gain on our COLI investment totaling $1,792,000 which was the primary contributor to investment gains in 2019.\nFinancial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, based on U.S generally accepted accounting principles, were as follows:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

\"pretax income (loss) from operations\". The purpose of this reconciliation is to provide investors with information routinely utilized by management in analyzing and comparing the performance of our insurance operations between periods. This information reflects the financial performance of our insurance operations without the impact of investment gains/losses. We typically invest in equity securities with a long-term view. Short-term volatility due to changes in market value of equity securities held for sale, along with realized investment gains/losses on both fixed maturity and equity investments, can mask both the positive or negative performance of our insurance operations from period to period.\nPremium Revenue:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net premiums earned were up $927,000 at $60,810,000 compared to $59,883,000 during the same period last year. The increase in premium revenue was primarily driven by an increase in net earned premium in the P&C segment of $1,082,000 or 2.0%. The increase in P&C segment net earned premium was primarily attributable to a 4.2% increase in gross earned premium in our dwelling fire program due to rate increases in the program over the past twelve months. As mentioned previously, the increased frequency of weather related losses over the past five years has driven the need to increase rates in states and programs that have been most impacted by this persistent pattern of severe weather.\nInvestment Gains:\nInvestment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the investment gain, in 2020, was a gain on available-for-sale fixed maturities of $1,361,000 compared to a gain on available-for-sale fixed maturities of $18,000\nfor the same period last year. In 2020, an increase in value of COLI investments totaled $343,000 compared to an increase of $295,000 for the same period last year. Partially offsetting the 2020 investment gains was a decline in value of our equity investments totaling $344,000 compared to an increase in value of equity investments of $712,000, in 2019. Investment gains in 2019 were also positively impacted by a realized gain on COLI of $1,792,000.\nNet Income (Loss):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8,619,000, $3.41 loss per share, compared to net income of $4,067,000, $1.61 income per share, for the same period last year. As mentioned previously, the primary reason for the 2020 net loss, compared to the 2019 net income, was a significant increase in property and casualty insured losses. The increase in P&C subsidiary losses was primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe losses from severe weather events in April of 2020 coupled with losses from Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter of 2020 as well as losses from Hurricanes Delta and Zeta in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nPretax Income (Loss) from Operations:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our pretax loss from operations was $12,641,000 compared to a pretax income from operations of $1,525,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019; a decrease of $14,166,000. As discussed above, an increase in claim activity in our P&C segment was the primary reason for the loss from operations, in 2020, compared to the same period last year.\nP&C Segment Combined Ratio:\nThe P&C segment ended 2020 with a GAAP basis combined ratio of 126.1%. Reported catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, totaled $24,196,000 and added 43.5 percentage points to the combined ratio. In comparison, the P&C segment ended 2019 with a GAAP basis combined ratio of 100.1% with $6,623,000 in reported catastrophe losses increasing the combined ratio by 12.1 percentage points. Partially offsetting the increase in reported catastrophe losses, in 2020, was a reduction in reported fire losses of $1,820,000. Reported fire losses totaled $12,172,000, in 2020, and added 21.9 percentage points to the 2020 combined ratio. In comparison, in 2019, reported fire losses totaled $13,992,000 and added 25.6 percentage points to the 2019 combined ratio. In addition, non-catastrophe wind and hail losses were down $1,267,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. Reported non-catastrophe wind and hail losses, in 2020, totaled $7,866,000 and added 14.1 percentage points to the 2020 combined ratio. In comparison, non-catastrophe wind and hail losses reported during 2019 totaled $9,133,000 and added 16.7 percentage points to the 2019 combined ratio.\nOverview - Balance Sheet highlights at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Balance Sheet Highlights </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ($ in thousands, except per share) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Invested Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,472 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,461 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvested Assets:\nInvested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $99,150,000 compared to $118,969,000 as of December 31, 2019; a decrease of 16.7%. The decrease in invested assets was primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and equity securities to meet the liquidity requirements of increased claim activity in the P&C segment during 2020 compared to 2019.\nCash:\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $19,887,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $11,809,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash increased $8,078,000 in 2020 primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities for the payment of weather related losses in our P&C subsidiary. Cash fluctuated significantly during the last six months of 2020 due to timing differences in the\npayment of weather related insurance claims and recoveries from reinsurers under our catastrophe reinsurance agreement.\nTotal Assets:\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2020 were $150,540,000 compared to $153,934,000 at December 31, 2019. Asset growth in 2020 was hindered by catastrophe losses in the P&C segment and was the primary reason for the 2.2% decrease in total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to total assets at December 31, 2019.\nPolicy Liabilities:\nPolicy related liabilities were $82,869,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $78,472,000 at December 31, 2019; an increase of $4,397,000 or 5.6%. The primary reason for the increase in policy liabilities was a $2,978,000 increase in P&C segment loss reserves, in 2020, compared to 2019, due to an increase in weather related claim activity.\nDebt Outstanding:\nTotal debt at December 31, 2020 was $13,677,000 compared to $14,164,000 at December 31, 2019. Debt was reduced $487,000 during 2020 primarily from the reduction in long-term debt in our holding company.\nShareholders' Equity:\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2020 was $45,366,000, down $8,095,000, compared to December 31, 2019 Shareholders' equity of $53,461,000. Book value per share was $17.93 at December 31, 2020, compared to $21.12 per share at December 31, 2019; a decline of 15.1% or $3.19 per share. The primary factors contributing to the decrease in both book value per share and Shareholders' equity were a net loss of $8,619,000 and shareholder dividends paid of $607,000. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1,142,000. The accumulated comprehensive income was primarily driven by increases in market value of our corporate bond investments available-for-sale.\nIndustry Segment Data:\nNet premiums earned for our two operating segments are summarized as follows:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life, accident and health insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and casualty insurance </td> <td>55,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>54,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe property and casualty segment composed 90.6% of consolidated net premiums earned in 2020 compared to 90.2% in 2019. Through the P&C segment, we offer primarily dwelling fire and homeowners insurance coverage to our customers. The life segment composed 9.4% of net premiums earned in 2020 compared to 9.8% in 2019 with revenue produced from life, accident and supplemental health insurance products. While reading this discussion regarding segment information, reference is made to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which provides additional segment related information.\nThe following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the Company along with non-insurance related information (primarily administration expenses and interest expense on debt) associated with the insurance holding company.\nLife and Accident and Health Insurance Operations:\nPremium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized below:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net premiums earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment income </td> <td>2,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment gains (losses) </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income </td> <td>1,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td>10,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BENEFITS AND EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Policyholder benefits paid or provided </td> <td>5,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs </td> <td>824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commissions </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General and administrative expenses </td> <td>1,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Insurance taxes, licenses and fees </td> <td>216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td>8,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,320 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nNet premiums earned in the life segment was $5,709,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $5,864,000 at December 31, 2019; a decrease of 2.6%. The $155,000 decrease in net earned premium revenue was primarily due to a decline in new business production in both the traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance products offered in NSIC.\nThe table below provides the major categories of investment income, primarily dividend and interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,075 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans on real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,785 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Investment expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile NSIC composes only 9.4% of premium revenue, the subsidiary holds 39.5% of consolidated assets. The majority of these assets consist of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income had a 3.5% decrease, at $2,583,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,677,000 for the same period last year. Lower reinvestment yields on fixed maturity investments due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2020 was the primary factor contributing to the moderate decline in interest income.\nThe table below provides investment gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gains principally real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNSIC net investment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $567,000 compared to net investment gains of $861,000 for the same period last year; a decrease of $294,000. Net investment gains and losses are highly dependent on numerous internal and external factors including but not limited to market conditions, tax position and liquidity needs of the Company and can vary significantly from period to period. A primary factor contributing to the decrease in net investment gains, in 2020, was an decrease in the change in value of equity securities held for investment to a gain of $104,000 compared to a gain of $589,000 in the prior year. Another factor contributing to the lower investment gains, in 2020, was a $233,000 realized gain, in 2019, primarily from our minority stake in privately held Trinity Bancorp, which merged with privately held River Financial Corporation, in October of 2019, in a cash and stock transaction.\nOther income was $1,242,000 in 2020 compared to $853,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $389,000. Other income consists primarily of adjuster fees paid to NSIC from the P&C segment. As a percent of net earned premium, other income was 21.8% in 2020 and 14.5% in 2019. The primary reason for the increase in other income, in 2020 compared to 2019, was an increase in claims from storm activity in the P&C segment leading to an increase in adjuster fees paid from NSFC to NSIC.\nClaims were $5,215,000 through December 31, 2020 compared to $5,027,000 through December 31, 2019; an increase of $188,000 or 3.7%. The primary reason for the increase was elevated claim payments, in 2020, due to an increase in ordinary life related claims.\nDeferred policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expenses increased $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 at $1,155,000 compared to $1,017,000 for the same period last year; an increase of 13.6%. As a percent of net premiums earned, policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expense was 20.2% in 2020 compared to 17.3% in 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were down slightly at $1,923,000, in 2020, compared to $1,948,000, in 2019. As a percent of earned premium, general and administrative expenses were 33.7% and 33.2% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $25,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses, in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to a decline in actuarial and consulting fees of $39,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were $216,000 and $285,000, respectively. As a percent of earned premium, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were 3.8% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2019. The primary reason for the decrease in, 2020 compared to 2019, was the payment of expenses associated with our Alabama Department of Insurance examination, in 2019, which were not incurred in 2020.\nInterest expense was $41,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense in NSIC is associated with interest payments on insurance policies with a deposit fund. Deposit fund balances declined in 2020 leading to the slight reduction in interest expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the life segment had pretax income of $1,551,000 compared to a pretax income of $1,935,000 for the same period last year. The $155,000 decrease in life segment revenues, coupled with the $188,000 increase in policyholder claims were the primary factors contributing to the $384,000 decrease in pretax income.\nProperty & Casualty Operations:\nPretax income for the P&C segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized below:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net premiums earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment income </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment gains </td> <td>1,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income </td> <td>582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td>58,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BENEFITS AND EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Policyholder benefits paid or provided </td> <td>49,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs </td> <td>2,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commissions </td> <td>7,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General and administrative expenses </td> <td>8,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,616 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Insurance taxes, licenses and fees </td> <td>2,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td>70,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,962) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nNet premiums earned in the P&C segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire and homeowner lines of business.

The primary reason for the increase, in 2020 compared to 2019, was a 4.2% increase in gross earned premium revenue in our dwelling fire program primarily driven by rate increases in the program over the last twelve months.\nThe primary source of premium revenue growth in the P&C segment was primarily the states of Alabama and Georgia. Premium revenue in Alabama increased 7.6%, in 2020, while policy counts decreased 1.7% compared to December 31, 2019. Increased rates were implemented in Alabama which lead to the year over year increase in premium revenue in the state. In addition, Georgia premium revenue increased 6.8% in 2020, while policy counts decreased 4.4%. The implementation of increased rates was the primary reason for the increase in premium revenue in Georgia, in 2020, compared to the same period last year.\nThe Company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from cat events. To summarize our catastrophe reinsurance structure, under the catastrophe reinsurance program in 2020, the Company retained the first $4,000,000 in losses from a first event and $2 million in losses from a second event.\nReinsurance coverage is maintained in three layers as follows:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Layer </td> <td>Reinsurers' Limits of Liability </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Layer </td> <td>100% of $13,500,000 in excess of $4,000,000 retention </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Layer </td> <td>100% of $25,000,000 in excess of $17,500,000 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Layer </td> <td>100% of $30,000,000 in excess of $42,500,000 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underlying 2nd Event </td> <td>100% of $2,000,000 in excess of $2,000,000 retention </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional details regarding the structure of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from catastrophic events. With our 2020 catastrophe contract placement, our single event catastrophe retention remained unchanged from the prior year at $4 million. In our 2020 contract, we maintained our underlying catastrophe aggregate coverage of $2 million in excess of $2 million, subject to a $2 million aggregate annual deductible. This additional coverage effectively lowers our second event retention to $2 million. Also unchanged from last year, we maintain catastrophe reinsurance covering incurred claims of a single catastrophe event up to $72.5 million. Our catastrophe reinsurance has a reinstatement provision for one event and covers the cost of a second event up to the same $72.5 million upper limit. In our reinsurance structure, management attempts to limit the impact on pretax earnings of a single modeled 100 year cat event to no more than $4 million (net of reinsurance). It is noted, however, that hurricane models are subject to significant risk and are only a tool to estimate the impact of catastrophe events. The Company also has risk associated with multiple catastrophe events that individually may not exceed our $4 million retention and would not be covered under our catastrophe reinsurance contract.\nIn our reinsurance structure, management attempts to limit the impact on pretax earnings of a single modeled 100 year cat event to no more than $4 million and the primary models utilized indicate that the Company's upper limit of reinsurance is adequate to cover up to approximately a 250 year event (a single event with an estimated probability of exceedance of 0.4% in a given year). It is noted, however, that hurricane models are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and are continuously evolving. Catastrophe models are only a tool to estimate the impact of catastrophe events and actual results can differ materially from model estimates.\nWe use the results of the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and AIR Worldwide (AIR) models in our review of exposure to hurricane risk. Each of these third party vendors provides two views of the modeled results as follows: (i) a long-term view that closely relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity; and (ii) a shorter-term view that adjusts historical frequencies to reflect expectations of elevated hurricane activity in the near future. We believe that modeled estimates provide a range of potential outcomes and we review multiple estimates for purposes of understanding our catastrophic risk and variability. However, due to regulatory and competitive limitations, we generally utilize long-term model output in the development of our product pricing.\nThe following table provides severe thunderstorm and hurricane single event model estimates for a range of return periods based on a blended view of the RMS and AIR long-term models utilizing our actual inforce P&C segment policy data as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Losses </td> <td>Net Losses 1\n</td> <td>Net Losses as\na Percent Equity 2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss Return Period </td> <td>Yearly Probability of Exceeding </td> <td>Severe Thunderstorm </td> <td>Hurricane </td> <td>Severe Thunderstorm </td> <td>Hurricane </td> <td>Severe Thunderstorm </td> <td>Hurricane </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20 Years </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,200 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,858 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,528 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 Years </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,759 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,487 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100 Years </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,222 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,556 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>250 Years </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,655 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,710 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>500 Years </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,980 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,938 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 - Net losses are net of reinsurance and after a 21% Federal income tax benefit.\n2 - Equity as of December 31, 2020\nIn 2020, the P&C segment had catastrophe losses from two hurricanes exceeding our $4 million catastrophe reinsurance retention. In addition, the P&C segment had catastrophe losses from two additional hurricanes and a significant spring storm event with losses attaching to our underlying catastrophe aggregate coverage. Furthermore, the P&C segment was impacted, in 2020, by 23 additional smaller catastrophe events that individually did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention; but cumulatively generated incurred losses totaling $9,787,000. In 2019, the P&C segment did not have any catastrophe losses exceeding our $4 million catastrophe reinsurance retention. However, the P&C segment was impacted, in 2019, by 23 smaller catastrophe events that individually did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention; but cumulatively generated incurred losses totaling $6,623,000.\nAdditional details regarding the structure of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe table below provides the major categories of investment income, primarily dividend and interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,664 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Investment expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1,530,000 compared to $1,683,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $153,000 or 9.1%. Lower yields on new investments in 2020 was the primary factor contributing to this marginal decrease in net investment income.\nThe table below provides investment gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses) on fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(448) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in surrender value of company owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain on company owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,792 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(180) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet investment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1,043,000 compared to net investment gains of $2,178,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $1,135,000. The primary reason for the decrease in net investment gains, in 2020 compared to 2019, was a gain on our company owned life insurance (COLI) investment of $1,792,000, in 2019. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we had unrealized losses in our P&C segment equity investments available for sale totaling $448,000 compared to unrealized gains in equity investments of $122,000, in 2019.\nOther income was comparable at $582,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $575,000 in 2019; an increase of $7,000. Other income consists primarily of fees related to the issuance of our property insurance policies as well as other miscellaneous income. As a percent of net earned premium, other income was 1.1% in both 2020 and 2019.\nPolicyholder claims in the property and casualty segment were $49,425,000 in 2020, compared to $33,979,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $15,446,000 or 45.5%. Claims as a percentage of premium earned was 89.7% in 2020 compared to 62.9% in 2019. The primary reason for the increase in claims was a $17,573,000\nincrease in P&C segment catastrophe weather claims. This increase was offset by decreases in non-catastrophe weather claims and fire claims totaling $1,267,000 and $1,820,000, respectively.\nWeather related losses create the most significant variability in our loss and loss adjustment expense payments from year to year in our P&C segment.

$24,196,000 net of reinsurance recoveries. In comparison, the P&C segment was impacted by 23 catastrophe events during 2019 from 1,353 claims totaling $6,623,000. During 2020, the P&C segment had multiple severe weather events that contributed to elevated insured losses due to damage from strong winds, hail and tornadoes as well as insured losses from four hurricanes. Reported losses from the three largest non-hurricane catastrophe events (all occurring in April) coupled with reported losses from Hurricane Laura (Cat 2050), Hurricane Sally (Cat 2063), Hurricane Delta (Cat 2071) and Hurricane Zeta (Cat 2074) totaled $18,112,000, net of reinsurance recoveries. The three April 2020 cat events accounted for 31.6% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2020 and added 13.7 percentage points to the current year P&C segment combined ratio. Net of reinsurance, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Sally, Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta accounted for 43.3% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2020 and added 18.8 percentage points to the 2020 P&C segment combined ratio. In comparison, reported losses in the P&C segment from Hurricane Barry (Cat 1943),\nHurricane Dorian (Cat 1954) and Tropical Storm Olga (Cat 1963), in 2019, totaled $2,772,000 and accounted for 41.9% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2019. Hurricane Barry, Hurricane Dorian and Tropical Storm Olga added 5.1 percentage points to the 2019 P&C segment combined ratio.\nNon-catastrophe wind and hail claims reported in 2020 totaled $7,866,000 compared to non-catastrophe wind and hail claims reported in 2019 totaling $9,133,000; a decrease of $1,267,000. During 2020, the P&C segment had 1,731 non-cat wind and hail claims reported (an average of $4,500 per claim) compared to 2,197 non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2019 (an average of $4,200 per claim). Non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2020 accounted for 15.9% of total P&C segment incurred losses in the current year and added 14.1 percentage points to the 2020 P&C segment combined ratio. Non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2019 accounted for 26.9% of total P&C segment incurred losses in 2019 and added 16.7 percentage points to the 2019 P&C segment combined ratio.\nReported fire losses in 2020 were down $1,820,000 or 13.0% compared to fire losses reported during 2019. The P&C segment had 416 fire losses reported in 2020 totaling $12,172,000 compared to 481 claims reported in 2019 totaling $13,992,000. The average cost per claim was $29,300 for fire losses reported in 2020 compared to $29,100 for fire losses reported in 2019. Fire losses reported during 2020 added 21.9 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio while fire losses reported during 2019 added 25.6 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs were virtually unchanged at $2,724,000, in 2020, compared to $2,723,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $1,000. Policy acquisition costs consist of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs and current commission payments to agents. As a percentage of premium revenue, policy acquisition costs were comparable at 4.9% in 2020 and 5.0% in 2019.\nCommission expense for 2020 was $7,212,000 (13.1% of premium revenue) compared to $7,148,000 (13.2% of premium revenue) for the same period in 2019. The primary reason for the $64,000 increase in commission expense was the 2.2% increase in gross written premium, in 2020, compared to 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the property and casualty segment totaled $8,589,000 in 2020 compared to $8,616,000 in 2019; a 0.3% decrease. The primary factors contributing to the $27,000 decrease in general expenses, in 2020, compared to the same period last year, was a $114,000 decline in actuarial fees.\nInsurance taxes, licenses and fees were $2,268,000 through December 31, 2020, compared to $2,185,000 for the same period last year. As a percentage of net premiums earned, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.0% for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the increase in taxes, licenses and fees, in 2020, compared to 2019, was the 2.2% increase in P&C segment gross written premium, in 2020, compared to 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a pretax loss of $11,962,000 compared to pretax income of $3,804,000 for the same period in 2019. The $15,766,000 decrease was primarily due to the $17,573,000 increase in catastrophe claims, in 2020 compared to 2019.\nProperty & Casualty Combined Ratio:\nA measure used to analyze a property/casualty insurer's underwriting performance is the combined ratio based upon generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It is the sum of two ratios:\n\u2022The loss and loss expense ratio, which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue.\n\u2022The underwriting expense ratio, which measures underwriting expenses incurred (e.g., agents' commissions, premium taxes, and other administrative underwriting expenses) as a percentage of premium revenue.\nThe results of these ratios by significant component for the past two years were as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE Ratio (Non-Cat) </td> <td>45.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50.11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE Ratio (Cat) </td> <td>43.45 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting Expense Ratio </td> <td>37.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37.86 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined Ratio </td> <td>126.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintaining a combined ratio below 100%, which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit, depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic coast, strict underwriting of risks, catastrophe reinsurance costs, severe thunderstorm frequency and the ability to obtain adequate and timely premium rates. A major hurricane hitting the coast of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi or Louisiana could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from year to year. In addition, most of the states that we write business are prone to severe thunderstorm and tornado activity with significant variations in the level of activity from year to year. The property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe; however, the geography of our coverage area, frequency of smaller catastrophe events and prohibitive cost of maintaining lower catastrophe deductibles and/or catastrophe aggregate coverage prevents some limitations on our ability to further mitigate catastrophe risks.\nDuring 2020, the P&C segment experienced an increase of 26.0 percentage points in the combined ratio compared to 2019. Catastrophe losses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, leading to a 31.32 percentage point increase in the P&C segment combined ratio and was the primary reason for the overall increase. Non-catastrophe losses decreased the P&C segment combined ratio 4.80 percentage points in the current year compared to the same period last year. As noted in the table above, catastrophe loss is the primary source of variability in our combined ratio and is generally the primary driver of variability in our earnings. While catastrophe events are unpredictable and often occur in cycles, management has sought to increase margins through efficiency measures and improved rate optimization. Management continues to improve rate adequacy, reduce significant exposure concentrations and implement other risk management strategies in order to further improve underwriting profitability, mitigate earnings volatility and reduce downside risk to our capital position.\nNon-insurance Operations:\nThe non-insurance operations of the Company consist of our ultimate holding company parent, The National Security Group, Inc. (NSEC). NSEC, as a standalone entity, has no material sources of revenue and relies on dividends and management service fees from our insurance subsidiaries to pay expenses. Dividends from subsidiaries are subject to insurance department approval and are also subject to statutory restrictions. Subsidiary dividends and service fees are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financial statements included herein. Revenues and expense (excluding intercompany dividends from subsidiaries) for non-insurance operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net realized investment gains </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income </td> <td>1,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td>1,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,091 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General and administrative expenses </td> <td>892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td>1,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(607) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,159) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nRevenue for non-insurance operations primarily consists of interest on investments and other income. Other income is composed of management service fees from subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation. General and administrative expenses totaled $892,000 in 2020 compared to $1,128,000 for the same period last\nyear. The expenses of NSG are primarily associated with the public listing of our stock, taxes and fees, and directors' fees. The most significant item impacting the decline in general expenses was a decrease in the liability for unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Total interest expense associated with short-term and long-term borrowings of NSG was $823,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1,122,000 for the same period in 2019. The Company entered into two interest rates swaps during 2020 to reduce the rate of interest paid on its trust preferred securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the interest rate swaps. A reduction in debt outstanding was also a factor in the decline in interest expense.\nInvestments:\nThe insurance subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities. The types of assets in which the Company can invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets. While working within the parameters of these regulatory requirements and further considering liquidity and capital needs, the Company considers investment quality, investment return, asset/liability matching and composition of the investment portfolio when making investment decisions.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company's holdings in fixed maturity securities amounted to 83% of total investments and 54.7% of total assets. The Company utilizes the ratings of various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations when classifying fixed maturity investments by credit quality.\nThe following is a breakdown of the Company's fixed maturity investments by quality rating:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Bond Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P or Equivalent Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA/AA+ </td> <td> </td> <td>37.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>46.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA- </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A+ </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A- </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Below Investment Grade </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no material changes in credit quality mix in 2020 as we continue to focus on investing in high quality investment grade securities. Also, tight credit spreads throughout 2020 limited the rewards of investing in lower quality issues.\nOur holdings in below investment grade securities are primarily comprised of energy sector investments and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's). We have evaluated our current below investment grade holdings for potential impairment, along with any other security with a market value substantially below our amortized cost. We currently have no investment below 80% of amortized cost and based on presently available information, we do not believe any below investment grade securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. We also currently have no fixed income investments in default.\nThe amortized cost and aggregate fair values of investments in investment securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as

The increase is primarily driven by the decline in interest rates and tightening of corporate bond spreads in the fixed maturity investment portfolio.\nA number of factors influence portfolio allocation within each of the insurance subsidiaries. Within the property and casualty subsidiaries, due to the relatively short-term nature of segment liabilities, fixed income investments tend to be of shorter duration, with average maturities of less than five years. Also, due to higher levels of potential volatility of policy liabilities (severe weather related losses), a greater emphasis is placed upon overall liquidity of investments. In contrast, within the life insurance subsidiary, policy liabilities tend to be more stable and of significantly longer duration. In order to match the longer duration of liabilities, investments in the life insurance portfolio tend to have longer maturities, and higher average book yields. Also, less emphasis is placed upon short-term liquidity in the life subsidiary due to more predictable cash needs.\nA downside of investing in longer duration securities in the life segment is that the portfolio is exposed to more significant price volatility as market interest rates rise. This exposure to sudden interest rate changes can lead to\ndeclines in market value of fixed income securities in a rising interest rate environment. Management currently maintains the life insurance portfolio in the intermediate duration range of 6.0 to guard against the adverse impact of rising rates. However, due to the necessity of matching the longer duration of life policy liabilities as closely as possible in order to pass regulatory cash flow testing and avoid significant interest rate speculation in the asset liability matching process, some volatility in market value of the portfolio in a rising rate environment cannot be avoided.\nAt December 31, 2020, 6.5% of total investments in the fixed income portfolio were classified as below investment grade. In evaluating whether or not the equity loss positions were other-than-temporary impairments, management evaluated financial information on each company and, where available, reviewed analyst reports from independent sources. Based on a review of the available financial information, the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the Company's intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered, it was determined that the securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments. Management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company realized $180,000 in other-than-temporary impairments related to fixed maturities.\nThe amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity, are as follows. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due in one year or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after one year through five years </td> <td> </td> <td>18,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,601 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after five years through ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>24,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>32,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,003 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Held-to-maturity securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after one year through five years </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after five years through ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>924 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>946 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed earlier, the majority of our longer duration securities are investments made to match longer duration liabilities in the life segment or are investments in mortgage backed securities, primarily government agency. Due to the amortizing nature and the ability to prepay mortgage backed securities, actual maturities tend to be significantly shorter than contractual maturities.\nInvestment portfolio income\nInvestment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average current yield on investments </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return on investments </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on investments (before taxes) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,055 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in accumulated net unrealized gains (before income taxes) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage current yield on investments in 2020 remained unchanged compared to 2019. The total return on investments in 2020 was 6.6% compared to 10.2% in 2019. Increases in market value of fixed maturity investments due to declines in market interest rates was a primary driver of total return on investments in 2020. A gain on our\ncompany owned life insurance investment coupled with interest rate driven increases in value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale were the primary factors driving the higher total return in 2019 compared 2020.\nRepurchase agreements\nThe Company's subsidiaries maintain repurchase agreements for cash held on deposit under which insurance regulations dictates that our policy requires 102% (100% minimum) of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral. The repurchase investments are overnight agreements and investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid. Therefore, these investments are reflected on the balance sheet as cash equivalents. Due to a combination of the 102% collateral requirement and low short-term interest rates, we realize limited interest income from repurchase agreements/short-term investments. However, repurchase agreements utilizing government agency securities do provide deposit protection for short-term cash held in excess of FDIC deposit limits. The Company does not lend securities to any counterparty under repurchase agreements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nDue to regulatory restrictions, the majority of the Company's cash is required to be invested primarily in investment-grade securities to provide protection for policyholders. The liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms, and therefore, those subsidiaries invest in securities with various effective maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding 10 years with an average portfolio duration typically of less than 5 years. The liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration, and therefore, a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding 10 years.\nThe liquidity requirements for the Company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. All operations and virtually all investments are maintained by the insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property/casualty businesses, while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits, the cost of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, purchases of new investments, and in the case of life insurance, policy loans.\nVirtually all invested assets of the Company are held in the insurance subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the contractual maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the Company, stated at amortized cost, was as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\nMaturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Available- for-Sale </td> <td> </td> <td>Held-to-Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity in less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity in 1-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>18,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.96 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity in 5-10 years </td> <td> </td> <td>24,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity after 10 years </td> <td> </td> <td>32,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated/contractual maturity. Due to call and prepayment features inherent in some fixed maturity securities, actual repayment, or effective maturities, will differ from stated maturities. The Company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk. However, due to other factors, both regulatory and those associated with good investment management practices associated with asset/liability matching, we do have exposure to changes in market values of securities due to changes in interest rates. Currently, a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates would generate approximately a $3,826,000, or 4.7%, decline in the market value of fixed maturity investments. Alternatively, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates will generate approximately $3,638,000, or 4.5%, increase in market value of fixed income investments. Management has attempted, to the extent possible, to reduce risk in a rising rate environment. However, due to asset/liability matching requirements, particularly in the life subsidiary portfolio, interest rate risk can not be eliminated and exposure to market volatility can cause some variability in our accumulated other comprehensive income, total return on investments, total shareholders' equity and book value per share.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had aggregate equity capital, unrealized investment gains (net of income taxes) and retained earnings of $45,366,000, down $8,095,000, compared to $53,461,000 at December 31,\n2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, shareholders' equity was decreased by a net loss of $8,619,000, increased by comprehensive income due to changes in value of fixed maturity securities of $1,580,000 and decreased by a comprehensive loss of $438,000 related to change in value of interest rate swaps. Equity was also increased by common stock issued of $25,000. Equity was reduced $36,000 by the purchase of 2,509 common stock shares held as treasury stock and by cash dividends paid totaling $607,000.\nAs discussed above, changing interest rates can have a significant impact on the market value of fixed maturity investments. Fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale increase the liquidity resources of the Company as they can be sold at any time to pay claims or meet other Company obligations. However, these securities are required to be carried at market value with net of tax change in accumulated unrealized gains and losses directly impacting shareholder's equity. While the increase in interest rates causes near term declines in the value of fixed income securities, we are able to reap the benefit of reinvesting at higher rates as current fixed income investments are called, amortized (mortgage backed securities) or reach contractual maturity. Over the next twelve months, based on cash flow projection modeling that considers such factors as anticipated principal payments on mortgage backed securities, likelihood of call provisions being enacted and regular contractual maturities, we expect approximately 8% of our current fixed income portfolio to be reinvested or otherwise available to meet Company obligations.\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $19,887,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $11,809,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash used in operating activities decreased cash by $13,890,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily related to the net loss for the period which was triggered by an increase in claims and claims related expenses in the P&C segment from spring storms during the second quarter and hurricane losses during the third and fourth quarters. Cash provided by operating activities increased cash by $5,373,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash from operating activities was driven by refunds of federal income tax overpayment along with changes in other assets and reinsurance recoveries. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $23,083,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,656,000 in 2019. The increase in cash from investing activities was related to maturities, some increases in prepayments on mortgage backed securities and sales of investments to maintain adequate liquidity to settle P&C segment hurricane claims. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 primarily consisted of maturities of investments in which reinvestment was delayed in order to increase liquidity during hurricane season. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,115,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $896,000 for the same period last year. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $607,000 in dividends to shareholders.\nThe Holding Company had $3,108,000 in cash at December 31, 2020. The Holding Company primarily relies on cash from subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including payment of dividends to shareholders along with interest and principal on outstanding debt. Currently the Holding Company has adequate liquidity on hand to meet its anticipated obligations through 2021 without additional dividend payments from subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 totaled $16,779,000.\nThe Company had a total of $13,177,000 of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, compared to $13,664,000 at December 31, 2019, which includes $12,372,000 in trust preferred securities issued by the Company in addition to the installment note. Current year and prior year amounts were reduced by the unamortized portion of the placement fees associated with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, $195,000 and $208,000, respectively.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n1 through 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n4 through 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt obligations1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and casualty claim reserves2\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future life insurance obligations3\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Long-term debt, consisting of two separate issues of trust preferred securities, a line of credit and the long-term portion of an installment note is assumed to be settled at contractual maturity.

Interest on long-term debt is accrued and settled quarterly on the trust preferred securities, monthly on the line of credit and annually on the installment note. Therefore, the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above. These calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments. For additional information regarding long-term debt and interest on long-term debt, please see Note 8, Notes Payable and Long-term Debt, in the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 The anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves, which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses, are based upon historical payout patterns.

For additional details on payout patterns please see Note 9.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 Future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies in force at December 31, 2020. These estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. In contrast to this table, the majority of NSIC's obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Management believes that current assets, future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual obligations reflected in the table above include the issuance of $9,129,000 in subordinated debentures completed on December 15, 2005. The subordinated debentures mature December 15, 2035. It is anticipated that principal payments will not be made before maturity. Also included in long-term debt is the issuance of $3,035,000 in subordinated debentures on June 21, 2007. This issue matures June 15, 2037 and may be prepaid at any time. Also reflected in the table above is a $1,500,000 unsecured loan renewed in December 2019. The unsecured loan matures in November 2023.\nIn estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves, the Company utilized historical payment patterns. By the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist, there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above. However, management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due. Also, due to the relatively short-tail nature of the majority of the Company's property and casualty claim liabilities, management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately 97.5% of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period. See Note 9 for additional details on payout patterns.\nThe ability of the Company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends, in addition to current cash flow, on the liquidity of its investments. The Company has relatively little exposure to below investment grade fixed income investments, which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets.\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are primarily met by funds provided from operations of the insurance subsidiaries. The Company receives funds from its subsidiaries through payment of dividends, management fees, reimbursements for federal income taxes and reimbursement of expenses incurred at the corporate level for the subsidiaries. These funds are used to pay stockholder dividends, principal and interest on debt, corporate administrative expenses, federal income taxes, and for funding investments in the subsidiaries. The Company has no separate source of revenue other than dividends and fees from the insurance subsidiaries. Also, dividends from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and, therefore, are limited depending on capital levels and earnings of the subsidiaries.\nOur P&C segment is the primary source of dividends to the holding company. Consideration of insurance subsidiary growth opportunities, regulatory capital adequacy, rating agency impact and holding company debt reduction, among other items, are factors that influence our subsidiary dividend requirements. While we have made significant progress in recent years, continued strengthening capital levels in the insurance subsidiaries and reduction of debt remains a top priority. However, a decline in regulatory capital in our P&C subsidiary in 2020 due to increased catastrophe loss frequency will limit our ability to prepay any debt obligations beyond what is required for at least the next two years.\nDividends paid from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and prior approval of the Alabama Department of Insurance. As disclosed in Note 12 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the amount that The National Security Group's insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company during 2021 is statutorily limited to $1,168,000 in the life insurance subsidiary and $3,650,000 in the property/casualty insurance subsidiary. Dividends are limited to the greater of net income (operating income for life subsidiary) or 10% of statutory capital, and regulators consider dividends paid within the preceding twelve months when calculating the available dividend capacity. Therefore, all of the above referenced dividend capacity will not be available for consideration of payment until dividends paid in the preceding twelve months have been considered on a rolling basis. The Company also has to continuously evaluate other factors such as subsidiary operating performance, subsidiary capital requirements and potential impact by rating agencies in making decisions on how much capital can be released from insurance subsidiaries for payment of dividends to NSG. These factors are considered along with the goal of growing year over year statutory surplus in the subsidiaries, and these considerations along with potential adverse impacts on regulatory surplus, will likely lead to dividend payments to NSG substantially below the above referenced regulatory maximums. The Company received $1,100,000 in dividends from its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to a decline in statutory surplus in our P&C subsidiaries during 2020, the result of increased in catastrophe losses, we do not expect to pay any dividends from these subsidiaries for at least the next twelve months as our primary focus will be on rebuilding statutory surplus.\nThe Company's subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs, claims, other policy benefits, interest expense, general expenses, and dividends to the Company. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities, calls, and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash for both subsidiaries. A significant portion of the Company's investment portfolio, which is held by the insurance subsidiaries, consists of readily marketable securities, which can be sold for cash.\nThe Company continues to monitor liquidity and subsidiary capital closely. Despite challenging weather patterns in the property and casualty subsidiaries over the past three years, the insurance subsidiaries are well capitalized. However, further strengthening of subsidiary capital continues to be a top priority for management.\nExcept as discussed above, the Company is unaware of any known trends, events, or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity, capital resources, or operations. Additionally, the Company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities, which if implemented, would have such an effect.\nStatutory Risk-Based Capital of Insurance Subsidiaries:\nThe NAIC has adopted Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements for life/health and property/casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality, mortality and morbidity, asset and liability matching, benefit and loss reserve adequacy, and other business factors. State insurance regulators will use the RBC formula as an early warning tool to identify, for the purpose of initiating regulatory action, insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized. In addition, the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state-by-state basis. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the Company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels, each of which requires corrective action.\nThe levels and ratios are as follows:\nRatio of Total Adjusted Capital to\nAuthorized Control Level RBC\nRegulatory Event (Less Than or Equal to)\nCompany action level 2.0\nRegulatory action level 1.5\nAuthorized control level 1.0\nMandatory control level 0.7\nThe ratios of Total Adjusted Capital to Authorized Control Level RBC for The National Security Group's life/health and property/casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of 4 to 1 at December 31, 2020.\nNational Security Insurance Company (life insurer) has regulatory adjusted capital of $10,784,000 and $17,210,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 8.9 and 15.0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, National Security Insurance Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nNational Security Fire & Casualty Company (property/casualty insurer) has regulatory adjusted capital of $36,505,000 and $36,264,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 4.8 and 5.1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, National Security Fire & Casualty Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nOmega One Insurance Company (property/casualty insurer), which began writing business in late 1995, has regulatory adjusted capital of $7,083,000 and $11,430,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 12.7 and 20.1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, Omega One Insurance Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies:\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies may be based on (including but not limited to) GAAP authoritative literature, statutory authoritative literature, regulations and industry standards. The Company's financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies. It is management's opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022Reinsurance\n\u2022Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n\u2022Income Taxes\n\u2022Fair Values of Financial Instruments\n\u2022Claim Liabilities\n\u2022Recognition of Revenue\n\u2022Contingencies\nReinsurance\nRisk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements. The reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts. Although the reinsurance protects our Company in the event a loss exceeds retention limits specified in a particular reinsurance agreement; ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our Company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due. We record an asset for reinsurance recoverable in the financial statements for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible. If we discover an amount due may not be received, we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time.\nWhen a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured, we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant. Subsequently, we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contract.\nReinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed $50,000 for any one insured.\nDuring 2020, the property and casualty segment maintained a catastrophe reinsurance contract, which covered losses exceeding a retention related to a single catastrophic event. In the event a catastrophe exceeded the $4 million company retention stated in the contract, reinsurers would reimburse the company 100% of gross losses up to the upper limits of the reinsurance agreement, which was $72.5 million in 2020 and 2019. Any losses above the $72.5 million upper limit are the responsibility of our Company. The contract in place during 2020 also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event with the same upper $72.5 million upper limit but with a reduced retention of $2 million due to placement of an aggregate Layer of coverage of $2 million in excess of a $2 million event minimum subject to a $2 million aggregate annual deductible.\nThe property and casualty subsidiaries utilize our actual in force policy data modeled utilizing two different industry accepted catastrophe models to structure catastrophe reinsurance and determine upper limits of catastrophe\nreinsurance agreements. Historically, reinsurance has been maintained to meet at least a 250 year modeled event level. While this estimate is subject to some uncertainty and model risk, through obtaining coverage that meets at least a 250 year modeled event level, the models indicate that we maintain catastrophe reinsurance upper limits to cover an event that has less than a 0.5% probability of occurring in a given year.\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was $6,874,000 compared to $276,000 for the same period last year. The Company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount. In 2020, catastrophe reinsurance premiums ceded totaled $6,274,000 compared to $6,008,000 ceded in 2019. Catastrophe reinsurance premiums are based on a premium calculation applying the agreed upon rate to the total insured value of the covered lines of business. In addition to catastrophe reinsurance, the Company placed reinstatement premium protection (RPP) reinsurance during 2020 and 2019 totaling $1,022,000 and $1,033,000, respectively.\nThe reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management's interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty. Areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include: assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed.\nThere is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded. This possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties, such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable. Management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability. For more information regarding reinsurance, see the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business. DAC is primarily comprised of commissions, premium taxes, and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception; rather, they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies.\nA reduction in DAC is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs, and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income. Management reviews DAC calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability. Changes in management's assumptions, estimates or judgment with respect to calculating DAC could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition. Changes in loss ratios, projected investment income, premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of DAC.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $7,408,000 and $7,666,000, respectively, as an asset for DAC in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs. For more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted.\nAt December 31, 2020, there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable. For more information regarding deferred income taxes, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates all tax positions taken on its U.S. federal income tax return. No material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the Company.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nInvestments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available. Quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements. Further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Periodically, the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value, volatility, credit quality and existing market conditions. Management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Evaluation criteria include credit quality of security, severity of decrease between cost and market value, length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future. This evaluation requires significant assumptions, estimates and judgments by management. If the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement. We have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments.\nClaim Liabilities\nProperty and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims. Loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry. Reserves are management's expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost. Management's estimate of reserves are based on historical settlement patterns, estimated salvage and subrogation, and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances. Management's reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness. The reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review performed at year-end.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded liability for loss and loss adjustment expense was $10,177,000 and $7,199,000, respectively, a $2,978,000 increase. The increase in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves is primarily due to claims outstanding from third and fourth quarter hurricanes at December 31, 2020. We believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices. For more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecognition of Revenue\nLife insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due. Property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Unearned premiums represent that portion of direct premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policy contracts in force and is reported as a liability. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as an asset.\nContingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from, but not limited to, litigation, claims, assessments, fines and penalties are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated. Significant attorney fees are estimated and recorded when incurred. Additional details with respect to contingencies are disclosed in Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of The National Security Group, Inc. (referred to in this document as \"we\", \"our\", \"us\", \"Company\" or \"NSEC\") and its subsidiaries. We are a smaller reporting company\u201d under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and therefore qualify for the scaled disclosure of smaller reporting companies. In general, the same information is required to be disclosed in the management discussion and analysis by smaller reporting companies except that the discussion need only cover the latest two year period and disclosures relating to contractual obligations are not required. In accordance with the scaled disclosure requirements, the following discussion generally covers the change in financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which accompany this report. Please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on page 4 of this report.\nThe National Security Group, Inc. operates in ten states with 64.2% of total premium revenue generated in the states of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. We operate in two business segments summarized as follows:\n\u2022The Property and Casualty (P&C) segment is the most significant segment, accounting for 91.5% of gross earned premium in 2020. The P&C segment operates in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\u2022The Life segment accounted for 8.5% of gross premium revenue in 2020. The Life segment is licensed to underwrite life and accident and health insurance in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\nThe P&C segment operations are conducted through National Security Fire & Casualty Company (NSFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1959, and Omega One Insurance Company (Omega), a wholly owned subsidiary of NSFC organized in 1992. Omega produces no direct written premium and is authorized to underwrite lines of business similar to NSFC; therefore, all references to NSFC or P&C segment in the remainder of this discussion will include the insurance operations of both NSFC and Omega.\nThe Life segment operations are conducted through National Security Insurance Company (NSIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1947. All references to NSIC or life segment in the remainder of this management discussion and analysis will refer to the combined life, accident and health insurance operations.\nOur income is principally derived from net underwriting profits and investment income. Net underwriting profit is principally derived from earned premiums received less claims paid, sales commissions to agents, costs of underwriting and insurance taxes and fees. Investment income includes interest and dividend income and gains and losses on investment holdings.\nAll of the insurance subsidiaries are Alabama domiciled insurance companies; therefore, the Alabama Department of Insurance is the primary insurance regulator. However, each subsidiary is subject to regulation by the respective insurance regulators of each state in which it is licensed to transact business. Insurance rates charged by each of the insurance subsidiaries are typically subject to review and approval by the insurance department for the respective state in which the rates will apply.\nAll of our insurance companies have been assigned ratings by A.M. Best Co (Best). On April 21, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) of \"bbb\" of NSFC. In addition, A.M. Best affirmed the FSR of B+ (Good) and Long-Term ICR of \"bbb-\" of Omega. The A.M. Best outlook for the ratings is \"stable\" for NSFC and Omega. A.M. Best upgraded the FSR to B++ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR to \"bbb\" for NSIC. The outlook for the ratings of NSIC is \"stable\". A.M. Best also affirmed the Long-Term ICR of \"bb\" of the parent holding company, NSEC, with a \"stable\" outlook.\nThe property and casualty subsidiaries have been assigned ratings by Demotech, Inc. On December 12, 2020, Demotech affirmed a Financial Stability Rating of A (Exceptional) for both NSFC and Omega.\nThe earnings in the property and casualty segment have seasonal volatility due to severe storm activity resulting in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses from hurricane, tornado, wind and hail related insurance claims. These storm systems or other natural disasters are classified as catastrophes (referred to as \"catastrophe\" or \"cat\" events/losses throughout the remainder of this document) by Property Claim Service (PCS) when an individual event causes $25 million or more in industry wide direct insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers.\nA primary process utilized by management to review financial performance is evaluating the operating performance of each segment before intercompany eliminations. By performing the evaluation in this manner, management can better assess the profitability of each segment on a standalone basis. To provide information similar to that utilized by management, industry segment information presented in this discussion is presented on a pretax basis by segment before eliminations. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K contains a reconciliation of the net income by segment to consolidated net income.\nIn order to present information as analyzed by Company management, the P&C segment combined ratio in this Management Discussion and Analysis is presented before certain intercompany eliminations. These intercompany eliminations, which are presented in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily include management and service fees paid by each subsidiary to NSEC, along with fees and expenses of the Company's employee claims adjusters. Claims adjusters are employees of NSIC but provide claim adjustment services to NSFC at rates comparable to those paid to independent (non-employee) adjusters utilized by NSFC. Management believes that the analysis of the P&C segment combined ratio prior to elimination of the intercompany transactions provides a more realistic view of performance and is consistent with our internal evaluation of operating performance.\nInformation in this discussion is presented in whole dollars rounded to the nearest thousand, except for per share information. Tabular amounts are presented in thousands.\nSummary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8,619,000, $3.41 loss per share, compared to a net income of $4,067,000, $1.61 income per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year to date pretax loss from operations, in 2020, totaled $12,641,000 compared to a pretax income from operations of $1,525,000 in 2019. The primary reason for the significant loss in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was a $15,332,000 increase in policyholder benefits; primarily driven by a significant increase in catastrophe claims in the P&C segment. Results for 2020 were also impacted by investment gains of $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 in 2019.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had insured claims (net of reinsurance recoveries) totaling $53,930,000 compared to $38,598,000 for the same period last year. The P&C segment was the primary source of this increase with claims up $15,446,000 in 2020, compared to 2019. The primary component of this increase was claims reported from catastrophe events which increased $17,573,000, in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had investment gains of $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $1,432,000. The primary reason for the investment gains in 2020 was a $1,361,000 gain on fixed maturities. In 2019, we had a gain on our COLI investment totaling $1,792,000 which was the primary contributor to investment gains in 2019.\nFinancial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, based

\"pretax income (loss) from operations\". The purpose of this reconciliation is to provide investors with information routinely utilized by management in analyzing and comparing the performance of our insurance operations between periods. This information reflects the financial performance of our insurance operations without the impact of investment gains/losses. We typically invest in equity securities with a long-term view. Short-term volatility due to changes in market value of equity securities held for sale, along with realized investment gains/losses on both fixed maturity and equity investments, can mask both the positive or negative performance of our insurance operations from period to period.\nPremium Revenue:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net premiums earned were up $927,000 at $60,810,000 compared to $59,883,000 during the same period last year. The increase in premium revenue was primarily driven by an increase in net earned premium in the P&C segment of $1,082,000 or 2.0%. The increase in P&C segment net earned premium was primarily attributable to a 4.2% increase in gross earned premium in our dwelling fire program due to rate increases in the program over the past twelve months. As mentioned previously, the increased frequency of weather related losses over the past five years has driven the need to increase rates in states and programs that have been most impacted by this persistent pattern of severe weather.\nInvestment Gains:\nInvestment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the investment gain, in 2020, was a gain on available-for-sale fixed maturities of $1,361,000 compared to a gain on available-for-sale fixed maturities of $18,000\nfor the same period last year. In 2020, an increase in value of COLI investments totaled $343,000 compared to an increase of $295,000 for the same period last year. Partially offsetting the 2020 investment gains was a decline in value of our equity investments totaling $344,000 compared to an increase in value of equity investments of $712,000, in 2019. Investment gains in 2019 were also positively impacted by a realized gain on COLI of $1,792,000.\nNet Income (Loss):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8,619,000, $3.41 loss per share, compared to net income of $4,067,000, $1.61 income per share, for the same period last year. As mentioned previously, the primary reason for the 2020 net loss, compared to the 2019 net income, was a significant increase in property and casualty insured losses. The increase in P&C subsidiary losses was primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe losses from severe weather events in April of 2020 coupled with losses from Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter of 2020 as well as losses from Hurricanes Delta and Zeta in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nPretax Income (Loss) from Operations:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our pretax loss from operations was $12,641,000 compared to a pretax income from operations of $1,525,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019; a decrease of $14,166,000. As discussed above, an increase in claim activity in our P&C segment was the primary reason for the loss from operations, in 2020, compared to the same period last year.\nP&C Segment Combined Ratio:\nThe P&C segment ended 2020 with a GAAP basis combined ratio of 126.1%. Reported catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, totaled $24,196,000 and added 43.5 percentage points to the combined ratio. In comparison, the P&C segment ended 2019 with a GAAP basis combined ratio of 100.1% with $6,623,000 in reported catastrophe losses increasing the combined ratio by 12.1 percentage points. Partially offsetting the increase in reported catastrophe losses, in 2020, was a reduction in reported fire losses of $1,820,000. Reported fire losses totaled $12,172,000, in 2020, and added 21.9 percentage points to the 2020 combined ratio. In comparison, in 2019, reported fire losses totaled $13,992,000 and added 25.6 percentage points to the 2019 combined ratio. In addition, non-catastrophe wind and hail losses were down $1,267,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. Reported non-catastrophe wind and hail losses, in 2020, totaled $7,866,000 and added 14.1 percentage points to the 2020 combined ratio. In comparison, non-catastrophe wind and hail losses reported during 2019 totaled $9,133,000 and added 16.7 percentage points to the 2019 combined ratio.\nOverview - Balance Sheet highlights at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Balance Sheet Highlights </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ($ in thousands, except per share) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Invested Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,472 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,461 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvested Assets:\nInvested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $99,150,000 compared to $118,969,000 as of December 31, 2019; a decrease of 16.7%. The decrease in invested assets was primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and equity securities to meet the liquidity requirements of increased claim activity in the P&C segment during 2020 compared to 2019.\nCash:\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $19,887,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $11,809,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash increased $8,078,000 in 2020 primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities for the payment of weather related losses in our P&C subsidiary. Cash fluctuated significantly during the last six months of 2020 due to timing differences in the\npayment of weather related insurance claims and recoveries from reinsurers under our catastrophe reinsurance agreement.\nTotal Assets:\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2020 were $150,540,000 compared to $153,934,000 at December 31, 2019. Asset growth in 2020 was hindered by catastrophe losses in the P&C segment and was the primary reason for the 2.2% decrease in total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to total assets at December 31, 2019.\nPolicy Liabilities:\nPolicy related liabilities were $82,869,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $78,472,000 at December 31, 2019; an increase of $4,397,000 or 5.6%. The primary reason for the increase in policy liabilities was a $2,978,000 increase in P&C segment loss reserves, in 2020, compared to 2019, due to an increase in weather related claim activity.\nDebt Outstanding:\nTotal debt at December 31, 2020 was $13,677,000 compared to $14,164,000 at December 31, 2019. Debt was reduced $487,000 during 2020 primarily from the reduction in long-term debt in our holding company.\nShareholders' Equity:\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2020 was $45,366,000, down $8,095,000, compared to December 31, 2019 Shareholders' equity of $53,461,000. Book value per share was $17.93 at December 31, 2020, compared to $21.12 per share at December 31, 2019; a decline of 15.1% or $3.19 per share. The primary factors contributing to the decrease in both book value per share and Shareholders' equity were a net loss of $8,619,000 and shareholder dividends paid of $607,000. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1,142,000. The accumulated comprehensive income was primarily driven by increases in market value of our corporate bond investments available-for-sale.\nIndustry Segment Data:\nNet premiums earned for our two operating segments are summarized as follows:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life, accident and health insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and casualty insurance </td> <td>55,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>54,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe property and casualty segment composed 90.6% of consolidated net premiums earned in 2020 compared to 90.2% in 2019.

The life segment composed 9.4% of net premiums earned in 2020 compared to 9.8% in 2019 with revenue produced from life, accident and supplemental health insurance products. While reading this discussion regarding segment information, reference is made to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which provides additional segment related information.\nThe following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the Company along with non-insurance related information (primarily administration expenses and interest expense on debt) associated with the insurance holding company.\nLife and Accident and Health Insurance Operations:\nPremium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized below:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net premiums earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment income </td> <td>2,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment gains (losses) </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income </td> <td>1,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td>10,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BENEFITS AND EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Policyholder benefits paid or provided </td> <td>5,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs </td> <td>824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commissions </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General and administrative expenses </td> <td>1,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Insurance taxes, licenses and fees </td> <td>216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td>8,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,320 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nNet premiums earned in the life segment was $5,709,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $5,864,000 at December 31, 2019; a decrease of 2.6%. The $155,000 decrease in net earned premium revenue was primarily due to a decline in new business production in both the traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance products offered in NSIC.\nThe table below provides the major categories of investment income, primarily dividend and interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,075 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans on real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,785 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Investment expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile NSIC composes only 9.4% of premium revenue, the subsidiary holds 39.5% of consolidated assets. The majority of these assets consist of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income had a 3.5% decrease, at $2,583,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,677,000 for the same period last year. Lower reinvestment yields on fixed maturity investments due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2020 was the primary factor contributing to the moderate decline in interest income.\nThe table below provides investment gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gains principally real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNSIC net investment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $567,000 compared to net investment gains of $861,000 for the same period last year; a decrease of $294,000. Net investment gains and losses are highly dependent on numerous internal and external factors including but not limited to market conditions, tax position and liquidity needs of the Company and can vary significantly from period to period. A primary factor contributing to the decrease in net investment gains, in 2020, was an decrease in the change in value of equity securities held for investment to a gain of $104,000 compared to a gain of $589,000 in the prior year. Another factor contributing to the lower investment gains, in 2020, was a $233,000 realized gain, in 2019, primarily from our minority stake in privately held Trinity Bancorp, which merged with privately held River Financial Corporation, in October of 2019, in a cash and stock transaction.\nOther income was $1,242,000 in 2020 compared to $853,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $389,000. Other income consists primarily of adjuster fees paid to NSIC from the P&C segment. As a percent of net earned premium, other income was 21.8% in 2020 and 14.5% in 2019. The primary reason for the increase in other income, in 2020 compared to 2019, was an increase in claims from storm activity in the P&C segment leading to an increase in adjuster fees paid from NSFC to NSIC.\nClaims were $5,215,000 through December 31, 2020 compared to $5,027,000 through December 31, 2019; an increase of $188,000 or 3.7%. The primary reason for the increase was elevated claim payments, in 2020, due to an increase in ordinary life related claims.\nDeferred policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expenses increased $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 at $1,155,000 compared to $1,017,000 for the same period last year; an increase of 13.6%. As a percent of net premiums earned, policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expense was 20.2% in 2020 compared to 17.3% in 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were down slightly at $1,923,000, in 2020, compared to $1,948,000, in 2019. As a percent of earned premium, general and administrative expenses were 33.7% and 33.2% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $25,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses, in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to a decline in actuarial and consulting fees of $39,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were $216,000 and $285,000, respectively. As a percent of earned premium, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were 3.8% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2019. The primary reason for the decrease in, 2020 compared to 2019, was the payment of expenses associated with our Alabama Department of Insurance examination, in 2019, which were not incurred in 2020.\nInterest expense was $41,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense in NSIC is associated with interest payments on insurance policies with a deposit fund. Deposit fund balances declined in 2020 leading to the slight reduction in interest expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the life segment had pretax income of $1,551,000 compared to a pretax income of $1,935,000 for the same period last year. The $155,000 decrease in life segment revenues, coupled with the $188,000 increase in policyholder claims were the primary factors contributing to the $384,000 decrease in pretax income.\nProperty & Casualty Operations:\nPretax income for the P&C segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized below:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net premiums earned </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment income </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment gains </td> <td>1,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income </td> <td>582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td>58,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BENEFITS AND EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Policyholder benefits paid or provided </td> <td>49,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs </td> <td>2,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commissions </td> <td>7,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General and administrative expenses </td> <td>8,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,616 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Insurance taxes, licenses and fees </td> <td>2,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td>70,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,962) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nNet premiums earned in the P&C segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire and homeowner lines of business.

The primary reason for the increase, in 2020 compared to 2019, was a 4.2% increase in gross earned premium revenue in our dwelling fire program primarily driven by rate increases in the program over the last twelve months.\nThe primary source of premium revenue growth in the P&C segment was primarily the states of Alabama and Georgia. Premium revenue in Alabama increased 7.6%, in 2020, while policy counts decreased 1.7% compared to December 31, 2019. Increased rates were implemented in Alabama which lead to the year over year increase in premium revenue in the state. In addition, Georgia premium revenue increased 6.8% in 2020, while policy counts decreased 4.4%. The implementation of increased rates was the primary reason for the increase in premium revenue in Georgia, in 2020, compared to the same period last year.\nThe Company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from cat events. To summarize our catastrophe reinsurance structure, under the catastrophe reinsurance program in 2020, the Company retained the first $4,000,000 in losses from a first event and $2 million in losses from a second event.\nReinsurance coverage is maintained in three layers as follows:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Layer </td> <td>Reinsurers' Limits of Liability </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Layer </td> <td>100% of $13,500,000 in excess of $4,000,000 retention </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Layer </td> <td>100% of $25,000,000 in excess of $17,500,000 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Layer </td> <td>100% of $30,000,000 in excess of $42,500,000 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underlying 2nd Event </td> <td>100% of $2,000,000 in excess of $2,000,000 retention </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional details regarding the structure of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from catastrophic events. With our 2020 catastrophe contract placement, our single event catastrophe retention remained unchanged from the prior year at $4 million. In our 2020 contract, we maintained our underlying catastrophe aggregate coverage of $2 million in excess of $2 million, subject to a $2 million aggregate annual deductible. This additional coverage effectively lowers our second event retention to $2 million. Also unchanged from last year, we maintain catastrophe reinsurance covering incurred claims of a single catastrophe event up to $72.5 million. Our catastrophe reinsurance has a reinstatement provision for one event and covers the cost of a second event up to the same $72.5 million upper limit. In our reinsurance structure, management attempts to limit the impact on pretax earnings of a single modeled 100 year cat event to no more than $4 million (net of reinsurance). It is noted, however, that hurricane models are subject to significant risk and are only a tool to estimate the impact of catastrophe events. The Company also has risk associated with multiple catastrophe events that individually may not exceed our $4 million retention and would not be covered under our catastrophe reinsurance contract.\nIn our reinsurance structure, management attempts to limit the impact on pretax earnings of a single modeled 100 year cat event to no more than $4 million and the primary models utilized indicate that the Company's upper limit of reinsurance is adequate to cover up to approximately a 250 year event (a single event with an estimated probability of exceedance of 0.4% in a given year). It is noted, however, that hurricane models are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and are continuously evolving. Catastrophe models are only a tool to estimate the impact of catastrophe events and actual results can differ materially from model estimates.\nWe use the results of the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and AIR Worldwide (AIR) models in our review of exposure to hurricane risk. Each of these third party vendors provides two views of the modeled results as follows: (i) a long-term view that closely relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity; and (ii) a shorter-term view that adjusts historical frequencies to reflect expectations of elevated hurricane activity in the near future. We believe that modeled estimates provide a range of potential outcomes and we review multiple estimates for purposes of understanding our catastrophic risk and variability. However, due to regulatory and competitive limitations, we generally utilize long-term model output in the development of our product pricing.\nThe following table provides severe thunderstorm and hurricane single event model estimates for a range of return periods based on a blended view of the RMS and AIR long-term models utilizing our actual inforce P&C segment policy data as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Losses </td> <td>Net Losses 1\n</td> <td>Net Losses as\na Percent Equity 2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss Return Period </td> <td>Yearly Probability of Exceeding </td> <td>Severe Thunderstorm </td> <td>Hurricane </td> <td>Severe Thunderstorm </td> <td>Hurricane </td> <td>Severe Thunderstorm </td> <td>Hurricane </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20 Years </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,200 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,858 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,528 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 Years </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,759 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,487 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100 Years </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,222 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,556 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>250 Years </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,655 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,710 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>500 Years </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,980 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,938 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 - Net losses are net of reinsurance and after a 21% Federal income tax benefit.\n2 - Equity as of December 31, 2020\nIn 2020, the P&C segment had catastrophe losses from two hurricanes exceeding our $4 million catastrophe reinsurance retention. In addition, the P&C segment had catastrophe losses from two additional hurricanes and a significant spring storm event with losses attaching to our underlying catastrophe aggregate coverage. Furthermore, the P&C segment was impacted, in 2020, by 23 additional smaller catastrophe events that individually did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention; but cumulatively generated incurred losses totaling $9,787,000. In 2019, the P&C segment did not have any catastrophe losses exceeding our $4 million catastrophe reinsurance retention. However, the P&C segment was impacted, in 2019, by 23 smaller catastrophe events that individually did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention; but cumulatively generated incurred losses totaling $6,623,000.\nAdditional details regarding the structure of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe table below provides the major categories of investment income, primarily dividend and interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,664 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Investment expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1,530,000 compared to $1,683,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $153,000 or 9.1%. Lower yields on new investments in 2020 was the primary factor contributing to this marginal decrease in net investment income.\nThe table below provides investment gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses) on fixed maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(448) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in surrender value of company owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain on company owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,792 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(180) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet investment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1,043,000 compared to net investment gains of $2,178,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $1,135,000. The primary reason for the decrease in net investment gains, in 2020 compared to 2019, was a gain on our company owned life insurance (COLI) investment of $1,792,000, in 2019. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we had unrealized losses in our P&C segment equity investments available for sale totaling $448,000 compared to unrealized gains in equity investments of $122,000, in 2019.\nOther income was comparable at $582,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $575,000 in 2019; an increase of $7,000. Other income consists primarily of fees related to the issuance of our property insurance policies as well as other miscellaneous income. As a percent of net earned premium, other income was 1.1% in both 2020 and 2019.\nPolicyholder claims in the property and casualty segment were $49,425,000 in 2020, compared to $33,979,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $15,446,000 or 45.5%. Claims as a percentage of premium earned was 89.7% in 2020 compared to 62.9% in 2019. The primary reason for the increase in claims was a $17,573,000\nincrease in P&C segment catastrophe weather claims. This increase was offset by decreases in non-catastrophe weather claims and fire claims totaling $1,267,000 and $1,820,000, respectively.\nWeather related losses create the most significant variability in our loss and loss adjustment expense payments from year to year in our P&C segment.

$24,196,000 net of reinsurance recoveries. In comparison, the P&C segment was impacted by 23 catastrophe events during 2019 from 1,353 claims totaling $6,623,000. During 2020, the P&C segment had multiple severe weather events that contributed to elevated insured losses due to damage from strong winds, hail and tornadoes as well as insured losses from four hurricanes. Reported losses from the three largest non-hurricane catastrophe events (all occurring in April) coupled with reported losses from Hurricane Laura (Cat 2050), Hurricane Sally (Cat 2063), Hurricane Delta (Cat 2071) and Hurricane Zeta (Cat 2074) totaled $18,112,000, net of reinsurance recoveries. The three April 2020 cat events accounted for 31.6% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2020 and added 13.7 percentage points to the current year P&C segment combined ratio. Net of reinsurance, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Sally, Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta accounted for 43.3% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2020 and added 18.8 percentage points to the 2020 P&C segment combined ratio. In comparison, reported losses in the P&C segment from Hurricane Barry (Cat 1943),\nHurricane Dorian (Cat 1954) and Tropical Storm Olga (Cat 1963), in 2019, totaled $2,772,000 and accounted for 41.9% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2019. Hurricane Barry, Hurricane Dorian and Tropical Storm Olga added 5.1 percentage points to the 2019 P&C segment combined ratio.\nNon-catastrophe wind and hail claims reported in 2020 totaled $7,866,000 compared to non-catastrophe wind and hail claims reported in 2019 totaling $9,133,000; a decrease of $1,267,000. During 2020, the P&C segment had 1,731 non-cat wind and hail claims reported (an average of $4,500 per claim) compared to 2,197 non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2019 (an average of $4,200 per claim). Non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2020 accounted for 15.9% of total P&C segment incurred losses in the current year and added 14.1 percentage points to the 2020 P&C segment combined ratio. Non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2019 accounted for 26.9% of total P&C segment incurred losses in 2019 and added 16.7 percentage points to the 2019 P&C segment combined ratio.\nReported fire losses in 2020 were down $1,820,000 or 13.0% compared to fire losses reported during 2019. The P&C segment had 416 fire losses reported in 2020 totaling $12,172,000 compared to 481 claims reported in 2019 totaling $13,992,000. The average cost per claim was $29,300 for fire losses reported in 2020 compared to $29,100 for fire losses reported in 2019. Fire losses reported during 2020 added 21.9 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio while fire losses reported during 2019 added 25.6 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs were virtually unchanged at $2,724,000, in 2020, compared to $2,723,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $1,000. Policy acquisition costs consist of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs and current commission payments to agents. As a percentage of premium revenue, policy acquisition costs were comparable at 4.9% in 2020 and 5.0% in 2019.\nCommission expense for 2020 was $7,212,000 (13.1% of premium revenue) compared to $7,148,000 (13.2% of premium revenue) for the same period in 2019. The primary reason for the $64,000 increase in commission expense was the 2.2% increase in gross written premium, in 2020, compared to 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the property and casualty segment totaled $8,589,000 in 2020 compared to $8,616,000 in 2019; a 0.3% decrease. The primary factors contributing to the $27,000 decrease in general expenses, in 2020, compared to the same period last year, was a $114,000 decline in actuarial fees.\nInsurance taxes, licenses and fees were $2,268,000 through December 31, 2020, compared to $2,185,000 for the same period last year. As a percentage of net premiums earned, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.0% for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the increase in taxes, licenses and fees, in 2020, compared to 2019, was the 2.2% increase in P&C segment gross written premium, in 2020, compared to 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a pretax loss of $11,962,000 compared to pretax income of $3,804,000 for the same period in 2019. The $15,766,000 decrease was primarily due to the $17,573,000 increase in catastrophe claims, in 2020 compared to 2019.\nProperty & Casualty Combined Ratio:\nA measure used to analyze a property/casualty insurer's underwriting performance is the combined ratio based upon generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It is the sum of two ratios:\n\u2022The loss and loss expense ratio, which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue.\n\u2022The underwriting expense ratio, which measures underwriting expenses incurred (e.g., agents' commissions, premium taxes, and other administrative underwriting expenses) as a percentage of premium revenue.\nThe results of these ratios by significant component for the past two years were as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE Ratio (Non-Cat) </td> <td>45.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50.11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE Ratio (Cat) </td> <td>43.45 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting Expense Ratio </td> <td>37.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37.86 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined Ratio </td> <td>126.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintaining a combined ratio below 100%, which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit, depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic coast, strict underwriting of risks, catastrophe reinsurance costs, severe thunderstorm frequency and the ability to obtain adequate and timely premium rates. A major hurricane hitting the coast of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi or Louisiana could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from year to year. In addition, most of the states that we write business are prone to severe thunderstorm and tornado activity with significant variations in the level of activity from year to year. The property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe; however, the geography of our coverage area, frequency of smaller catastrophe events and prohibitive cost of maintaining lower catastrophe deductibles and/or catastrophe aggregate coverage prevents some limitations on our ability to further mitigate catastrophe risks.\nDuring 2020, the P&C segment experienced an increase of 26.0 percentage points in the combined ratio compared to 2019. Catastrophe losses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, leading to a 31.32 percentage point increase in the P&C segment combined ratio and was the primary reason for the overall increase. Non-catastrophe losses decreased the P&C segment combined ratio 4.80 percentage points in the current year compared to the same period last year. As noted in the table above, catastrophe loss is the primary source of variability in our combined ratio and is generally the primary driver of variability in our earnings. While catastrophe events are unpredictable and often occur in cycles, management has sought to increase margins through efficiency measures and improved rate optimization. Management continues to improve rate adequacy, reduce significant exposure concentrations and implement other risk management strategies in order to further improve underwriting profitability, mitigate earnings volatility and reduce downside risk to our capital position.\nNon-insurance Operations:\nThe non-insurance operations of the Company consist of our ultimate holding company parent, The National Security Group, Inc. (NSEC). NSEC, as a standalone entity, has no material sources of revenue and relies on dividends and management service fees from our insurance subsidiaries to pay expenses. Dividends from subsidiaries are subject to insurance department approval and are also subject to statutory restrictions. Subsidiary dividends and service fees are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financial statements included herein. Revenues and expense (excluding intercompany dividends from subsidiaries) for non-insurance operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net realized investment gains </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income </td> <td>1,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td>1,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,091 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EXPENSES </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General and administrative expenses </td> <td>892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td>1,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(607) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,159) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nRevenue for non-insurance operations primarily consists of interest on investments and other income. Other income is composed of management service fees from subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation. General and administrative expenses totaled $892,000 in 2020 compared to $1,128,000 for the same period last\nyear. The expenses of NSG are primarily associated with the public listing of our stock, taxes and fees, and directors' fees. The most significant item impacting the decline in general expenses was a decrease in the liability for unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Total interest expense associated with short-term and long-term borrowings of NSG was $823,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1,122,000 for the same period in 2019. The Company entered into two interest rates swaps during 2020 to reduce the rate of interest paid on its trust preferred securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the interest rate swaps. A reduction in debt outstanding was also a factor in the decline in interest expense.\nInvestments:\nThe insurance subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities. The types of assets in which the Company can invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets. While working within the parameters of these regulatory requirements and further considering liquidity and capital needs, the Company considers investment quality, investment return, asset/liability matching and composition of the investment portfolio when making investment decisions.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company's holdings in fixed maturity securities amounted to 83% of total investments and 54.7% of total assets. The Company utilizes the ratings of various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations when classifying fixed maturity investments by credit quality.\nThe following is a breakdown of the Company's fixed maturity investments by quality rating:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Bond Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P or Equivalent Ratings </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA/AA+ </td> <td> </td> <td>37.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>46.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA- </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A+ </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A- </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Below Investment Grade </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no material changes in credit quality mix in 2020 as we continue to focus on investing in high quality investment grade securities. Also, tight credit spreads throughout 2020 limited the rewards of investing in lower quality issues.\nOur holdings in below investment grade securities are primarily comprised of energy sector investments and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's). We have evaluated our current below investment grade holdings for potential impairment, along with any other security with a market value substantially below our amortized cost. We currently have no investment below 80% of amortized cost and based on presently available information, we do not believe any below investment grade securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. We also currently have no fixed income investments in default.\nThe amortized cost and aggregate fair values of investments in investment securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as

The increase is primarily driven by the decline in interest rates and tightening of corporate bond spreads in the fixed maturity investment portfolio.\nA number of factors influence portfolio allocation within each of the insurance subsidiaries. Within the property and casualty subsidiaries, due to the relatively short-term nature of segment liabilities, fixed income investments tend to be of shorter duration, with average maturities of less than five years. Also, due to higher levels of potential volatility of policy liabilities (severe weather related losses), a greater emphasis is placed upon overall liquidity of investments. In contrast, within the life insurance subsidiary, policy liabilities tend to be more stable and of significantly longer duration. In order to match the longer duration of liabilities, investments in the life insurance portfolio tend to have longer maturities, and higher average book yields. Also, less emphasis is placed upon short-term liquidity in the life subsidiary due to more predictable cash needs.\nA downside of investing in longer duration securities in the life segment is that the portfolio is exposed to more significant price volatility as market interest rates rise. This exposure to sudden interest rate changes can lead to\ndeclines in market value of fixed income securities in a rising interest rate environment. Management currently maintains the life insurance portfolio in the intermediate duration range of 6.0 to guard against the adverse impact of rising rates. However, due to the necessity of matching the longer duration of life policy liabilities as closely as possible in order to pass regulatory cash flow testing and avoid significant interest rate speculation in the asset liability matching process, some volatility in market value of the portfolio in a rising rate environment cannot be avoided.\nAt December 31, 2020, 6.5% of total investments in the fixed income portfolio were classified as below investment grade. In evaluating whether or not the equity loss positions were other-than-temporary impairments, management evaluated financial information on each company and, where available, reviewed analyst reports from independent sources. Based on a review of the available financial information, the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the Company's intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered, it was determined that the securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments. Management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company realized $180,000 in other-than-temporary impairments related to fixed maturities.\nThe amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity, are as follows. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due in one year or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after one year through five years </td> <td> </td> <td>18,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,601 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after five years through ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>24,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>32,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,003 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Held-to-maturity securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after one year through five years </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after five years through ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after ten years </td> <td> </td> <td>852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>924 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>946 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed earlier, the majority of our longer duration securities are investments made to match longer duration liabilities in the life segment or are investments in mortgage backed securities, primarily government agency. Due to the amortizing nature and the ability to prepay mortgage backed securities, actual maturities tend to be significantly shorter than contractual maturities.\nInvestment portfolio income\nInvestment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average current yield on investments </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return on investments </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on investments (before taxes) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,055 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in accumulated net unrealized gains (before income taxes) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage current yield on investments in 2020 remained unchanged compared to 2019. The total return on investments in 2020 was 6.6% compared to 10.2% in 2019. Increases in market value of fixed maturity investments due to declines in market interest rates was a primary driver of total return on investments in 2020. A gain on our\ncompany owned life insurance investment coupled with interest rate driven increases in value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale were the primary factors driving the higher total return in 2019 compared 2020.\nRepurchase agreements\nThe Company's subsidiaries maintain repurchase agreements for cash held on deposit under which insurance regulations dictates that our policy requires 102% (100% minimum) of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral. The repurchase investments are overnight agreements and investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid. Therefore, these investments are reflected on the balance sheet as cash equivalents. Due to a combination of the 102% collateral requirement and low short-term interest rates, we realize limited interest income from repurchase agreements/short-term investments. However, repurchase agreements utilizing government agency securities do provide deposit protection for short-term cash held in excess of FDIC deposit limits. The Company does not lend securities to any counterparty under repurchase agreements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nDue to regulatory restrictions, the majority of the Company's cash is required to be invested primarily in investment-grade securities to provide protection for policyholders. The liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms, and therefore, those subsidiaries invest in securities with various effective maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding 10 years with an average portfolio duration typically of less than 5 years. The liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration, and therefore, a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding 10 years.\nThe liquidity requirements for the Company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. All operations and virtually all investments are maintained by the insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property/casualty businesses, while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits, the cost of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, purchases of new investments, and in the case of life insurance, policy loans.\nVirtually all invested assets of the Company are held in the insurance subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the contractual maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the Company, stated at amortized cost, was as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\nMaturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Available- for-Sale </td> <td> </td> <td>Held-to-Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity in less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity in 1-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>18,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.96 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity in 5-10 years </td> <td> </td> <td>24,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity after 10 years </td> <td> </td> <td>32,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated/contractual maturity. Due to call and prepayment features inherent in some fixed maturity securities, actual repayment, or effective maturities, will differ from stated maturities. The Company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk. However, due to other factors, both regulatory and those associated with good investment management practices associated with asset/liability matching, we do have exposure to changes in market values of securities due to changes in interest rates. Currently, a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates would generate approximately a $3,826,000, or 4.7%, decline in the market value of fixed maturity investments. Alternatively, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates will generate approximately $3,638,000, or 4.5%, increase in market value of fixed income investments. Management has attempted, to the extent possible, to reduce risk in a rising rate environment. However, due to asset/liability matching requirements, particularly in the life subsidiary portfolio, interest rate risk can not be eliminated and exposure to market volatility can cause some variability in our accumulated other comprehensive income, total return on investments, total shareholders' equity and book value per share.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had aggregate equity capital, unrealized investment gains (net of income taxes) and retained earnings of $45,366,000, down $8,095,000, compared to $53,461,000 at December 31,\n2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, shareholders' equity was decreased by a net loss of $8,619,000, increased by comprehensive income due to changes in value of fixed maturity securities of $1,580,000 and decreased by a comprehensive loss of $438,000 related to change in value of interest rate swaps. Equity was also increased by common stock issued of $25,000. Equity was reduced $36,000 by the purchase of 2,509 common stock shares held as treasury stock and by cash dividends paid totaling $607,000.\nAs discussed above, changing interest rates can have a significant impact on the market value of fixed maturity investments. Fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale increase the liquidity resources of the Company as they can be sold at any time to pay claims or meet other Company obligations. However, these securities are required to be carried at market value with net of tax change in accumulated unrealized gains and losses directly impacting shareholder's equity. While the increase in interest rates causes near term declines in the value of fixed income securities, we are able to reap the benefit of reinvesting at higher rates as current fixed income investments are called, amortized (mortgage backed securities) or reach contractual maturity. Over the next twelve months, based on cash flow projection modeling that considers such factors as anticipated principal payments on mortgage backed securities, likelihood of call provisions being enacted and regular contractual maturities, we expect approximately 8% of our current fixed income portfolio to be reinvested or otherwise available to meet Company obligations.\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $19,887,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $11,809,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash used in operating activities decreased cash by $13,890,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily related to the net loss for the period which was triggered by an increase in claims and claims related expenses in the P&C segment from spring storms during the second quarter and hurricane losses during the third and fourth quarters. Cash provided by operating activities increased cash by $5,373,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash from operating activities was driven by refunds of federal income tax overpayment along with changes in other assets and reinsurance recoveries. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $23,083,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,656,000 in 2019. The increase in cash from investing activities was related to maturities, some increases in prepayments on mortgage backed securities and sales of investments to maintain adequate liquidity to settle P&C segment hurricane claims. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 primarily consisted of maturities of investments in which reinvestment was delayed in order to increase liquidity during hurricane season. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,115,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $896,000 for the same period last year. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $607,000 in dividends to shareholders.\nThe Holding Company had $3,108,000 in cash at December 31, 2020. The Holding Company primarily relies on cash from subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including payment of dividends to shareholders along with interest and principal on outstanding debt. Currently the Holding Company has adequate liquidity on hand to meet its anticipated obligations through 2021 without additional dividend payments from subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 totaled $16,779,000.\nThe Company had a total of $13,177,000 of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, compared to $13,664,000 at December 31, 2019, which includes $12,372,000 in trust preferred securities issued by the Company in addition to the installment note. Current year and prior year amounts were reduced by the unamortized portion of the placement fees associated with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, $195,000 and $208,000, respectively.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n1 through 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n4 through 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt obligations1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and casualty claim reserves2\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future life insurance obligations3\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Long-term debt, consisting of two separate issues of trust preferred securities, a line of credit and the long-term portion of an installment note is assumed to be settled at contractual maturity.

Interest on long-term debt is accrued and settled quarterly on the trust preferred securities, monthly on the line of credit and annually on the installment note. Therefore, the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above. These calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments. For additional information regarding long-term debt and interest on long-term debt, please see Note 8, Notes Payable and Long-term Debt, in the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 The anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves, which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses, are based upon historical payout patterns.

For additional details on payout patterns please see Note 9.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 Future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies in force at December 31, 2020. These estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. In contrast to this table, the majority of NSIC's obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Management believes that current assets, future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual obligations reflected in the table above include the issuance of $9,129,000 in subordinated debentures completed on December 15, 2005. The subordinated debentures mature December 15, 2035. It is anticipated that principal payments will not be made before maturity. Also included in long-term debt is the issuance of $3,035,000 in subordinated debentures on June 21, 2007. This issue matures June 15, 2037 and may be prepaid at any time. Also reflected in the table above is a $1,500,000 unsecured loan renewed in December 2019. The unsecured loan matures in November 2023.\nIn estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves, the Company utilized historical payment patterns. By the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist, there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above. However, management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due. Also, due to the relatively short-tail nature of the majority of the Company's property and casualty claim liabilities, management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately 97.5% of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period. See Note 9 for additional details on payout patterns.\nThe ability of the Company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends, in addition to current cash flow, on the liquidity of its investments. The Company has relatively little exposure to below investment grade fixed income investments, which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets.\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are primarily met by funds provided from operations of the insurance subsidiaries. The Company receives funds from its subsidiaries through payment of dividends, management fees, reimbursements for federal income taxes and reimbursement of expenses incurred at the corporate level for the subsidiaries. These funds are used to pay stockholder dividends, principal and interest on debt, corporate administrative expenses, federal income taxes, and for funding investments in the subsidiaries. The Company has no separate source of revenue other than dividends and fees from the insurance subsidiaries. Also, dividends from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and, therefore, are limited depending on capital levels and earnings of the subsidiaries.\nOur P&C segment is the primary source of dividends to the holding company. Consideration of insurance subsidiary growth opportunities, regulatory capital adequacy, rating agency impact and holding company debt reduction, among other items, are factors that influence our subsidiary dividend requirements. While we have made significant progress in recent years, continued strengthening capital levels in the insurance subsidiaries and reduction of debt remains a top priority. However, a decline in regulatory capital in our P&C subsidiary in 2020 due to increased catastrophe loss frequency will limit our ability to prepay any debt obligations beyond what is required for at least the next two years.\nDividends paid from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and prior approval of the Alabama Department of Insurance. As disclosed in Note 12 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the amount that The National Security Group's insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company during 2021 is statutorily limited to $1,168,000 in the life insurance subsidiary and $3,650,000 in the property/casualty insurance subsidiary. Dividends are limited to the greater of net income (operating income for life subsidiary) or 10% of statutory capital, and regulators consider dividends paid within the preceding twelve months when calculating the available dividend capacity. Therefore, all of the above referenced dividend capacity will not be available for consideration of payment until dividends paid in the preceding twelve months have been considered on a rolling basis. The Company also has to continuously evaluate other factors such as subsidiary operating performance, subsidiary capital requirements and potential impact by rating agencies in making decisions on how much capital can be released from insurance subsidiaries for payment of dividends to NSG. These factors are considered along with the goal of growing year over year statutory surplus in the subsidiaries, and these considerations along with potential adverse impacts on regulatory surplus, will likely lead to dividend payments to NSG substantially below the above referenced regulatory maximums. The Company received $1,100,000 in dividends from its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to a decline in statutory surplus in our P&C subsidiaries during 2020, the result of increased in catastrophe losses, we do not expect to pay any dividends from these subsidiaries for at least the next twelve months as our primary focus will be on rebuilding statutory surplus.\nThe Company's subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs, claims, other policy benefits, interest expense, general expenses, and dividends to the Company. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities, calls, and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash for both subsidiaries. A significant portion of the Company's investment portfolio, which is held by the insurance subsidiaries, consists of readily marketable securities, which can be sold for cash.\nThe Company continues to monitor liquidity and subsidiary capital closely. Despite challenging weather patterns in the property and casualty subsidiaries over the past three years, the insurance subsidiaries are well capitalized. However, further strengthening of subsidiary capital continues to be a top priority for management.\nExcept as discussed above, the Company is unaware of any known trends, events, or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity, capital resources, or operations. Additionally, the Company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities, which if implemented, would have such an effect.\nStatutory Risk-Based Capital of Insurance Subsidiaries:\nThe NAIC has adopted Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements for life/health and property/casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality, mortality and morbidity, asset and liability matching, benefit and loss reserve adequacy, and other business factors. State insurance regulators will use the RBC formula as an early warning tool to identify, for the purpose of initiating regulatory action, insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized. In addition, the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state-by-state basis. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the Company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels, each of which requires corrective action.\nThe levels and ratios are as follows:\nRatio of Total Adjusted Capital to\nAuthorized Control Level RBC\nRegulatory Event (Less Than or Equal to)\nCompany action level 2.0\nRegulatory action level 1.5\nAuthorized control level 1.0\nMandatory control level 0.7\nThe ratios of Total Adjusted Capital to Authorized Control Level RBC for The National Security Group's life/health and property/casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of 4 to 1 at December 31, 2020.\nNational Security Insurance Company (life insurer) has regulatory adjusted capital of $10,784,000 and $17,210,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 8.9 and 15.0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, National Security Insurance Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nNational Security Fire & Casualty Company (property/casualty insurer) has regulatory adjusted capital of $36,505,000 and $36,264,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 4.8 and 5.1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, National Security Fire & Casualty Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nOmega One Insurance Company (property/casualty insurer), which began writing business in late 1995, has regulatory adjusted capital of $7,083,000 and $11,430,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 12.7 and 20.1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, Omega One Insurance Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies:\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies may be based on (including but not limited to) GAAP authoritative literature, statutory authoritative literature, regulations and industry standards. The Company's financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies. It is management's opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022Reinsurance\n\u2022Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n\u2022Income Taxes\n\u2022Fair Values of Financial Instruments\n\u2022Claim Liabilities\n\u2022Recognition of Revenue\n\u2022Contingencies\nReinsurance\nRisk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements. The reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts. Although the reinsurance protects our Company in the event a loss exceeds retention limits specified in a particular reinsurance agreement; ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our Company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due. We record an asset for reinsurance recoverable in the financial statements for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible. If we discover an amount due may not be received, we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time.\nWhen a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured, we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant. Subsequently, we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contract.\nReinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed $50,000 for any one insured.\nDuring 2020, the property and casualty segment maintained a catastrophe reinsurance contract, which covered losses exceeding a retention related to a single catastrophic event. In the event a catastrophe exceeded the $4 million company retention stated in the contract, reinsurers would reimburse the company 100% of gross losses up to the upper limits of the reinsurance agreement, which was $72.5 million in 2020 and 2019. Any losses above the $72.5 million upper limit are the responsibility of our Company. The contract in place during 2020 also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event with the same upper $72.5 million upper limit but with a reduced retention of $2 million due to placement of an aggregate Layer of coverage of $2 million in excess of a $2 million event minimum subject to a $2 million aggregate annual deductible.\nThe property and casualty subsidiaries utilize our actual in force policy data modeled utilizing two different industry accepted catastrophe models to structure catastrophe reinsurance and determine upper limits of catastrophe\nreinsurance agreements. Historically, reinsurance has been maintained to meet at least a 250 year modeled event level. While this estimate is subject to some uncertainty and model risk, through obtaining coverage that meets at least a 250 year modeled event level, the models indicate that we maintain catastrophe reinsurance upper limits to cover an event that has less than a 0.5% probability of occurring in a given year.\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was $6,874,000 compared to $276,000 for the same period last year. The Company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount. In 2020, catastrophe reinsurance premiums ceded totaled $6,274,000 compared to $6,008,000 ceded in 2019. Catastrophe reinsurance premiums are based on a premium calculation applying the agreed upon rate to the total insured value of the covered lines of business. In addition to catastrophe reinsurance, the Company placed reinstatement premium protection (RPP) reinsurance during 2020 and 2019 totaling $1,022,000 and $1,033,000, respectively.\nThe reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management's interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty. Areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include: assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed.\nThere is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded. This possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties, such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable. Management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability. For more information regarding reinsurance, see the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business. DAC is primarily comprised of commissions, premium taxes, and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception; rather, they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies.\nA reduction in DAC is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs, and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income. Management reviews DAC calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability. Changes in management's assumptions, estimates or judgment with respect to calculating DAC could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition. Changes in loss ratios, projected investment income, premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of DAC.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $7,408,000 and $7,666,000, respectively, as an asset for DAC in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs. For more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted.\nAt December 31, 2020, there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable. For more information regarding deferred income taxes, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates all tax positions taken on its U.S. federal income tax return. No material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the Company.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nInvestments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available. Quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements. Further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Periodically, the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value, volatility, credit quality and existing market conditions. Management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Evaluation criteria include credit quality of security, severity of decrease between cost and market value, length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future. This evaluation requires significant assumptions, estimates and judgments by management. If the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement. We have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments.\nClaim Liabilities\nProperty and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims. Loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry. Reserves are management's expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost. Management's estimate of reserves are based on historical settlement patterns, estimated salvage and subrogation, and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances. Management's reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness. The reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review performed at year-end.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded liability for loss and loss adjustment expense was $10,177,000 and $7,199,000, respectively, a $2,978,000 increase. The increase in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves is primarily due to claims outstanding from third and fourth quarter hurricanes at December 31, 2020. We believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices. For more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecognition of Revenue\nLife insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due. Property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Unearned premiums represent that portion of direct premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policy contracts in force and is reported as a liability. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as an asset.\nContingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from, but not limited to, litigation, claims, assessments, fines and penalties are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated. Significant attorney fees are estimated and recorded when incurred. Additional details with respect to contingencies are disclosed in Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of The National Security Group, Inc. (referred to in this document as \"we\", \"our\", \"us\", \"Company\" or \"NSEC\") and its subsidiaries. We are a smaller reporting company\u201d under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and therefore qualify for the scaled disclosure of smaller reporting companies. In general, the same information is required to be disclosed in the management discussion and analysis by smaller reporting companies except that the discussion need only cover the latest two year period and disclosures relating to contractual obligations are not required. In accordance with the scaled disclosure requirements, the following discussion generally covers the change in financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which accompany this report. Please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on page 4 of this report.\nThe National Security Group, Inc. operates in ten states with 64.2% of total premium revenue generated in the states of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. We operate in two business segments summarized as follows:\n\u2022The Property and Casualty (P&C) segment is the most significant segment, accounting for 91.5% of gross earned premium in 2020. The P&C segment operates in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\u2022The Life segment accounted for 8.5% of gross premium revenue in 2020. The Life segment is licensed to underwrite life and accident and health insurance in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\nThe P&C segment operations are conducted through National Security Fire & Casualty Company (NSFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1959, and Omega One Insurance Company (Omega), a wholly owned subsidiary of NSFC organized in 1992. Omega produces no direct written premium and is authorized to underwrite lines of business similar to NSFC; therefore, all references to NSFC or P&C segment in the remainder of this discussion will include the insurance operations of both NSFC and Omega.\nThe Life segment operations are conducted through National Security Insurance Company (NSIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1947. All references to NSIC or life segment in the remainder of this management discussion and analysis will refer to the combined life, accident and health insurance operations.\nOur income is principally derived from net underwriting profits and investment income. Net underwriting profit is principally derived from earned premiums received less claims paid, sales commissions to agents, costs of underwriting and insurance taxes and fees. Investment income includes interest and dividend income and gains and losses on investment holdings.\nAll of the insurance subsidiaries are Alabama domiciled insurance companies; therefore, the Alabama Department of Insurance is the primary insurance regulator. However, each subsidiary is subject to regulation by the respective insurance regulators of each state in which it is licensed to transact business. Insurance rates charged by each of the insurance subsidiaries are typically subject to review and approval by the insurance department for the respective state in which the rates will apply.\nAll of our insurance companies have been assigned ratings by A.M. Best Co (Best). On April 21, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) of \"bbb\" of NSFC. In addition, A.M. Best affirmed the FSR of B+ (Good) and Long-Term ICR of \"bbb-\" of Omega. The A.M. Best outlook for the ratings is \"stable\" for NSFC and Omega. A.M. Best upgraded the FSR to B++ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR to \"bbb\" for NSIC. The outlook for the ratings of NSIC is \"stable\". A.M. Best also affirmed the Long-Term ICR of \"bb\" of the parent holding company, NSEC, with a \"stable\" outlook.\nThe property and casualty subsidiaries have been assigned ratings by Demotech, Inc. On December 12, 2020, Demotech affirmed a Financial Stability Rating of A (Exceptional) for both NSFC and Omega.\nThe earnings in the property and casualty segment have seasonal volatility due to severe storm activity resulting in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses from hurricane, tornado, wind and hail related insurance claims. These storm systems or other natural disasters are classified as catastrophes (referred to as \"catastrophe\" or \"cat\" events/losses throughout the remainder of this document) by Property Claim Service (PCS) when an individual event causes $25 million or more in industry wide direct insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers.\nA primary process utilized by management to review financial performance is evaluating the operating performance of each segment before intercompany eliminations. By performing the evaluation in this manner, management can better assess the profitability of each segment on a standalone basis. To provide information similar to that utilized by management, industry segment information presented in this discussion is presented on a pretax basis by segment before eliminations. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K contains a reconciliation of the net income by segment to consolidated net income.\nIn order to present information as analyzed by Company management, the P&C segment combined ratio in this Management Discussion and Analysis is presented before certain intercompany eliminations. These intercompany eliminations, which are presented in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily include management and service fees paid by each subsidiary to NSEC, along with fees and expenses of the Company's employee claims adjusters. Claims adjusters are employees of NSIC but provide claim adjustment services to NSFC at rates comparable to those paid to independent (non-employee) adjusters utilized by NSFC. Management believes that the analysis of the P&C segment combined ratio prior to elimination of the intercompany transactions provides a more realistic view of performance and is consistent with our internal evaluation of operating performance.\nInformation in this discussion is presented in whole dollars rounded to the nearest thousand, except for per share information. Tabular amounts are presented in thousands.\nSummary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8,619,000, $3.41 loss per share, compared to a net income of $4,067,000, $1.61 income per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year to date pretax loss from operations, in 2020, totaled $12,641,000 compared to a pretax income from operations of $1,525,000 in 2019. The primary reason for the significant loss in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was a $15,332,000 increase in policyholder benefits; primarily driven by a significant increase in catastrophe claims in the P&C segment. Results for 2020 were also impacted by investment gains of $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 in 2019.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had insured claims (net of reinsurance recoveries) totaling $53,930,000 compared to $38,598,000 for the same period last year. The P&C segment was the primary source of this increase with claims up $15,446,000 in 2020, compared to 2019. The primary component of this increase was claims reported from catastrophe events which increased $17,573,000, in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had investment gains of $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $1,432,000. The primary reason for the investment gains in 2020 was a $1,361,000 gain on fixed maturities. In 2019, we had a gain on our COLI investment totaling $1,792,000 which was the primary contributor to investment gains in 2019.\nFinancial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, based on U.S generally accepted accounting principles, were as follows:\n\nWe provide a reconciliation of net income to the non-GAAP measurement \"pretax income (loss) from operations\". The purpose of this reconciliation is to provide investors with information routinely utilized by management in analyzing and comparing the performance of our insurance operations between periods. This information reflects the financial performance of our insurance operations without the impact of investment gains/losses. We typically invest in equity securities with a long-term view. Short-term volatility due to changes in market value of equity securities held for sale, along with realized investment gains/losses on both fixed maturity and equity investments, can mask both the positive or negative performance of our insurance operations from period to period.\nPremium Revenue:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net premiums earned were up $927,000 at $60,810,000 compared to $59,883,000 during the same period last year. The increase in premium revenue was primarily driven by an increase in net earned premium in the P&C segment of $1,082,000 or 2.0%. The increase in P&C segment net earned premium was primarily attributable to a 4.2% increase in gross earned premium in our dwelling fire program due to rate increases in the program over the past twelve months. As mentioned previously, the increased frequency of weather related losses over the past five years has driven the need to increase rates in states and programs that have been most impacted by this persistent pattern of severe weather.\nInvestment Gains:\nInvestment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1,623,000 compared to investment gains of $3,055,000 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the investment gain, in 2020, was a gain on available-for-sale fixed maturities of $1,361,000 compared to a gain on available-for-sale fixed maturities of $18,000\nfor the same period last year. In 2020, an increase in value of COLI investments totaled $343,000 compared to an increase of $295,000 for the same period last year. Partially offsetting the 2020 investment gains was a decline in value of our equity investments totaling $344,000 compared to an increase in value of equity investments of $712,000, in 2019. Investment gains in 2019 were also positively impacted by a realized gain on COLI of $1,792,000.\nNet Income (Loss):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8,619,000, $3.41 loss per share, compared to net income of $4,067,000, $1.61 income per share, for the same period last year. As mentioned previously, the primary reason for the 2020 net loss, compared to the 2019 net income, was a significant increase in property and casualty insured losses. The increase in P&C subsidiary losses was primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe losses from severe weather events in April of 2020 coupled with losses from Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter of 2020 as well as losses from Hurricanes Delta and Zeta in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nPretax Income (Loss) from Operations:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our pretax loss from operations was $12,641,000 compared to a pretax income from operations of $1,525,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019; a decrease of $14,166,000. As discussed above, an increase in claim activity in our P&C segment was the primary reason for the loss from operations, in 2020, compared to the same period last year.\nP&C Segment Combined Ratio:\nThe P&C segment ended 2020 with a GAAP basis combined ratio of 126.1%. Reported catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, totaled $24,196,000 and added 43.5 percentage points to the combined ratio. In comparison, the P&C segment ended 2019 with a GAAP basis combined ratio of 100.1% with $6,623,000 in reported catastrophe losses increasing the combined ratio by 12.1 percentage points. Partially offsetting the increase in reported catastrophe losses, in 2020, was a reduction in reported fire losses of $1,820,000. Reported fire losses totaled $12,172,000, in 2020, and added 21.9 percentage points to the 2020 combined ratio. In comparison, in 2019, reported fire losses totaled $13,992,000 and added 25.6 percentage points to the 2019 combined ratio. In addition, non-catastrophe wind and hail losses were down $1,267,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. Reported non-catastrophe wind and hail losses, in 2020, totaled $7,866,000 and added 14.1 percentage points to the 2020 combined ratio. In comparison, non-catastrophe wind and hail losses reported during 2019 totaled $9,133,000 and added 16.7 percentage points to the 2019 combined ratio.\nOverview - Balance Sheet highlights at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\n\nInvested Assets:\nInvested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $99,150,000 compared to $118,969,000 as of December 31, 2019; a decrease of 16.7%. The decrease in invested assets was primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and equity securities to meet the liquidity requirements of increased claim activity in the P&C segment during 2020 compared to 2019.\nCash:\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $19,887,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $11,809,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash increased $8,078,000 in 2020 primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities for the payment of weather related losses in our P&C subsidiary. Cash fluctuated significantly during the last six months of 2020 due to timing differences in the\npayment of weather related insurance claims and recoveries from reinsurers under our catastrophe reinsurance agreement.\nTotal Assets:\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2020 were $150,540,000 compared to $153,934,000 at December 31, 2019. Asset growth in 2020 was hindered by catastrophe losses in the P&C segment and was the primary reason for the 2.2% decrease in total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to total assets at December 31, 2019.\nPolicy Liabilities:\nPolicy related liabilities were $82,869,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $78,472,000 at December 31, 2019; an increase of $4,397,000 or 5.6%. The primary reason for the increase in policy liabilities was a $2,978,000 increase in P&C segment loss reserves, in 2020, compared to 2019, due to an increase in weather related claim activity.\nDebt Outstanding:\nTotal debt at December 31, 2020 was $13,677,000 compared to $14,164,000 at December 31, 2019. Debt was reduced $487,000 during 2020 primarily from the reduction in long-term debt in our holding company.\nShareholders' Equity:\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2020 was $45,366,000, down $8,095,000, compared to December 31, 2019 Shareholders' equity of $53,461,000. Book value per share was $17.93 at December 31, 2020, compared to $21.12 per share at December 31, 2019; a decline of 15.1% or $3.19 per share. The primary factors contributing to the decrease in both book value per share and Shareholders' equity were a net loss of $8,619,000 and shareholder dividends paid of $607,000. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1,142,000. The accumulated comprehensive income was primarily driven by increases in market value of our corporate bond investments available-for-sale.\nIndustry Segment Data:\nNet premiums earned for our two operating segments are summarized as follows:\n\nThe property and casualty segment composed 90.6% of consolidated net premiums earned in 2020 compared to 90.2% in 2019. Through the P&C segment, we offer primarily dwelling fire and homeowners insurance coverage to our customers. The life segment composed 9.4% of net premiums earned in 2020 compared to 9.8% in 2019 with revenue produced from life, accident and supplemental health insurance products. While reading this discussion regarding segment information, reference is made to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which provides additional segment related information.\nThe following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the Company along with non-insurance related information (primarily administration expenses and interest expense on debt) associated with the insurance holding company.\nLife and Accident and Health Insurance Operations:\nPremium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized below:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nNet premiums earned in the life segment was $5,709,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $5,864,000 at December 31, 2019; a decrease of 2.6%. The $155,000 decrease in net earned premium revenue was primarily due to a decline in new business production in both the traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance products offered in NSIC.\nThe table below provides the major categories of investment income, primarily dividend and interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nWhile NSIC composes only 9.4% of premium revenue, the subsidiary holds 39.5% of consolidated assets. The majority of these assets consist of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income had a 3.5% decrease, at $2,583,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,677,000 for the same period last year. Lower reinvestment yields on fixed maturity investments due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2020 was the primary factor contributing to the moderate decline in interest income.\nThe table below provides investment gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nNSIC net investment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $567,000 compared to net investment gains of $861,000 for the same period last year; a decrease of $294,000. Net investment gains and losses are highly dependent on numerous internal and external factors including but not limited to market conditions, tax position and liquidity needs of the Company and can vary significantly from period to period. A primary factor contributing to the decrease in net investment gains, in 2020, was an decrease in the change in value of equity securities held for investment to a gain of $104,000 compared to a gain of $589,000 in the prior year. Another factor contributing to the lower investment gains, in 2020, was a $233,000 realized gain, in 2019, primarily from our minority stake in privately held Trinity Bancorp, which merged with privately held River Financial Corporation, in October of 2019, in a cash and stock transaction.\nOther income was $1,242,000 in 2020 compared to $853,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $389,000. Other income consists primarily of adjuster fees paid to NSIC from the P&C segment. As a percent of net earned premium, other income was 21.8% in 2020 and 14.5% in 2019. The primary reason for the increase in other income, in 2020 compared to 2019, was an increase in claims from storm activity in the P&C segment leading to an increase in adjuster fees paid from NSFC to NSIC.\nClaims were $5,215,000 through December 31, 2020 compared to $5,027,000 through December 31, 2019; an increase of $188,000 or 3.7%. The primary reason for the increase was elevated claim payments, in 2020, due to an increase in ordinary life related claims.\nDeferred policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expenses increased $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 at $1,155,000 compared to $1,017,000 for the same period last year; an increase of 13.6%. As a percent of net premiums earned, policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expense was 20.2% in 2020 compared to 17.3% in 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were down slightly at $1,923,000, in 2020, compared to $1,948,000, in 2019. As a percent of earned premium, general and administrative expenses were 33.7% and 33.2% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $25,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses, in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to a decline in actuarial and consulting fees of $39,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were $216,000 and $285,000, respectively. As a percent of earned premium, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were 3.8% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2019. The primary reason for the decrease in, 2020 compared to 2019, was the payment of expenses associated with our Alabama Department of Insurance examination, in 2019, which were not incurred in 2020.\nInterest expense was $41,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense in NSIC is associated with interest payments on insurance policies with a deposit fund. Deposit fund balances declined in 2020 leading to the slight reduction in interest expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the life segment had pretax income of $1,551,000 compared to a pretax income of $1,935,000 for the same period last year. The $155,000 decrease in life segment revenues, coupled with the $188,000 increase in policyholder claims were the primary factors contributing to the $384,000 decrease in pretax income.\nProperty & Casualty Operations:\nPretax income for the P&C segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized below:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nNet premiums earned in the P&C segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire and homeowner lines of business. The following table provides premiums earned by line of business:\n\nProperty and casualty segment net premiums earned for 2020 were $55,101,000 compared to $54,019,000 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the increase, in 2020 compared to 2019, was a 4.2% increase in gross earned premium revenue in our dwelling fire program primarily driven by rate increases in the program over the last twelve months.\nThe primary source of premium revenue growth in the P&C segment was primarily the states of Alabama and Georgia. Premium revenue in Alabama increased 7.6%, in 2020, while policy counts decreased 1.7% compared to December 31, 2019. Increased rates were implemented in Alabama which lead to the year over year increase in premium revenue in the state. In addition, Georgia premium revenue increased 6.8% in 2020, while policy counts decreased 4.4%. The implementation of increased rates was the primary reason for the increase in premium revenue in Georgia, in 2020, compared to the same period last year.\nThe Company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from cat events. To summarize our catastrophe reinsurance structure, under the catastrophe reinsurance program in 2020, the Company retained the first $4,000,000 in losses from a first event and $2 million in losses from a second event.\nReinsurance coverage is maintained in three layers as follows:\n\nAdditional details regarding the structure of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from catastrophic events. With our 2020 catastrophe contract placement, our single event catastrophe retention remained unchanged from the prior year at $4 million. In our 2020 contract, we maintained our underlying catastrophe aggregate coverage of $2 million in excess of $2 million, subject to a $2 million aggregate annual deductible. This additional coverage effectively lowers our second event retention to $2 million. Also unchanged from last year, we maintain catastrophe reinsurance covering incurred claims of a single catastrophe event up to $72.5 million. Our catastrophe reinsurance has a reinstatement provision for one event and covers the cost of a second event up to the same $72.5 million upper limit. In our reinsurance structure, management attempts to limit the impact on pretax earnings of a single modeled 100 year cat event to no more than $4 million (net of reinsurance). It is noted, however, that hurricane models are subject to significant risk and are only a tool to estimate the impact of catastrophe events. The Company also has risk associated with multiple catastrophe events that individually may not exceed our $4 million retention and would not be covered under our catastrophe reinsurance contract.\nIn our reinsurance structure, management attempts to limit the impact on pretax earnings of a single modeled 100 year cat event to no more than $4 million and the primary models utilized indicate that the Company's upper limit of reinsurance is adequate to cover up to approximately a 250 year event (a single event with an estimated probability of exceedance of 0.4% in a given year). It is noted, however, that hurricane models are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and are continuously evolving. Catastrophe models are only a tool to estimate the impact of catastrophe events and actual results can differ materially from model estimates.\nWe use the results of the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and AIR Worldwide (AIR) models in our review of exposure to hurricane risk. Each of these third party vendors provides two views of the modeled results as follows: (i) a long-term view that closely relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity; and (ii) a shorter-term view that adjusts historical frequencies to reflect expectations of elevated hurricane activity in the near future. We believe that modeled estimates provide a range of potential outcomes and we review multiple estimates for purposes of understanding our catastrophic risk and variability. However, due to regulatory and competitive limitations, we generally utilize long-term model output in the development of our product pricing.\nThe following table provides severe thunderstorm and hurricane single event model estimates for a range of return periods based on a blended view of the RMS and AIR long-term models utilizing our actual inforce P&C segment policy data as of December 31, 2020:\n\n1 - Net losses are net of reinsurance and after a 21% Federal income tax benefit.\n2 - Equity as of December 31, 2020\nIn 2020, the P&C segment had catastrophe losses from two hurricanes exceeding our $4 million catastrophe reinsurance retention. In addition, the P&C segment had catastrophe losses from two additional hurricanes and a significant spring storm event with losses attaching to our underlying catastrophe aggregate coverage. Furthermore, the P&C segment was impacted, in 2020, by 23 additional smaller catastrophe events that individually did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention; but cumulatively generated incurred losses totaling $9,787,000. In 2019, the P&C segment did not have any catastrophe losses exceeding our $4 million catastrophe reinsurance retention. However, the P&C segment was impacted, in 2019, by 23 smaller catastrophe events that individually did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention; but cumulatively generated incurred losses totaling $6,623,000.\nAdditional details regarding the structure of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program can be found in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe table below provides the major categories of investment income, primarily dividend and interest income, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1,530,000 compared to $1,683,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $153,000 or 9.1%. Lower yields on new investments in 2020 was the primary factor contributing to this marginal decrease in net investment income.\nThe table below provides investment gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nNet investment gains, for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1,043,000 compared to net investment gains of $2,178,000 for the same period in 2019; a decrease of $1,135,000. The primary reason for the decrease in net investment gains, in 2020 compared to 2019, was a gain on our company owned life insurance (COLI) investment of $1,792,000, in 2019. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we had unrealized losses in our P&C segment equity investments available for sale totaling $448,000 compared to unrealized gains in equity investments of $122,000, in 2019.\nOther income was comparable at $582,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $575,000 in 2019; an increase of $7,000. Other income consists primarily of fees related to the issuance of our property insurance policies as well as other miscellaneous income. As a percent of net earned premium, other income was 1.1% in both 2020 and 2019.\nPolicyholder claims in the property and casualty segment were $49,425,000 in 2020, compared to $33,979,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $15,446,000 or 45.5%. Claims as a percentage of premium earned was 89.7% in 2020 compared to 62.9% in 2019. The primary reason for the increase in claims was a $17,573,000\nincrease in P&C segment catastrophe weather claims. This increase was offset by decreases in non-catastrophe weather claims and fire claims totaling $1,267,000 and $1,820,000, respectively.\nWeather related losses create the most significant variability in our loss and loss adjustment expense payments from year to year in our P&C segment. The following table provides a recap of P&C segment gross reported losses and LAE by catastrophe event and non-catastrophe wind and hail losses and LAE for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nDuring 2020, the P&C segment was impacted by 28 catastrophe events producing 5,546 policyholder claims totaling $24,196,000 net of reinsurance recoveries. In comparison, the P&C segment was impacted by 23 catastrophe events during 2019 from 1,353 claims totaling $6,623,000. During 2020, the P&C segment had multiple severe weather events that contributed to elevated insured losses due to damage from strong winds, hail and tornadoes as well as insured losses from four hurricanes. Reported losses from the three largest non-hurricane catastrophe events (all occurring in April) coupled with reported losses from Hurricane Laura (Cat 2050), Hurricane Sally (Cat 2063), Hurricane Delta (Cat 2071) and Hurricane Zeta (Cat 2074) totaled $18,112,000, net of reinsurance recoveries. The three April 2020 cat events accounted for 31.6% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2020 and added 13.7 percentage points to the current year P&C segment combined ratio. Net of reinsurance, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Sally, Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta accounted for 43.3% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2020 and added 18.8 percentage points to the 2020 P&C segment combined ratio. In comparison, reported losses in the P&C segment from Hurricane Barry (Cat 1943),\nHurricane Dorian (Cat 1954) and Tropical Storm Olga (Cat 1963), in 2019, totaled $2,772,000 and accounted for 41.9% of all reported catastrophe event claims through December 31, 2019. Hurricane Barry, Hurricane Dorian and Tropical Storm Olga added 5.1 percentage points to the 2019 P&C segment combined ratio.\nNon-catastrophe wind and hail claims reported in 2020 totaled $7,866,000 compared to non-catastrophe wind and hail claims reported in 2019 totaling $9,133,000; a decrease of $1,267,000. During 2020, the P&C segment had 1,731 non-cat wind and hail claims reported (an average of $4,500 per claim) compared to 2,197 non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2019 (an average of $4,200 per claim). Non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2020 accounted for 15.9% of total P&C segment incurred losses in the current year and added 14.1 percentage points to the 2020 P&C segment combined ratio. Non-cat wind and hail claims reported during 2019 accounted for 26.9% of total P&C segment incurred losses in 2019 and added 16.7 percentage points to the 2019 P&C segment combined ratio.\nReported fire losses in 2020 were down $1,820,000 or 13.0% compared to fire losses reported during 2019. The P&C segment had 416 fire losses reported in 2020 totaling $12,172,000 compared to 481 claims reported in 2019 totaling $13,992,000. The average cost per claim was $29,300 for fire losses reported in 2020 compared to $29,100 for fire losses reported in 2019. Fire losses reported during 2020 added 21.9 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio while fire losses reported during 2019 added 25.6 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs were virtually unchanged at $2,724,000, in 2020, compared to $2,723,000 for the same period last year; an increase of $1,000. Policy acquisition costs consist of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs and current commission payments to agents. As a percentage of premium revenue, policy acquisition costs were comparable at 4.9% in 2020 and 5.0% in 2019.\nCommission expense for 2020 was $7,212,000 (13.1% of premium revenue) compared to $7,148,000 (13.2% of premium revenue) for the same period in 2019. The primary reason for the $64,000 increase in commission expense was the 2.2% increase in gross written premium, in 2020, compared to 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the property and casualty segment totaled $8,589,000 in 2020 compared to $8,616,000 in 2019; a 0.3% decrease. The primary factors contributing to the $27,000 decrease in general expenses, in 2020, compared to the same period last year, was a $114,000 decline in actuarial fees.\nInsurance taxes, licenses and fees were $2,268,000 through December 31, 2020, compared to $2,185,000 for the same period last year. As a percentage of net premiums earned, insurance taxes, licenses and fees were 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.0% for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the increase in taxes, licenses and fees, in 2020, compared to 2019, was the 2.2% increase in P&C segment gross written premium, in 2020, compared to 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a pretax loss of $11,962,000 compared to pretax income of $3,804,000 for the same period in 2019. The $15,766,000 decrease was primarily due to the $17,573,000 increase in catastrophe claims, in 2020 compared to 2019.\nProperty & Casualty Combined Ratio:\nA measure used to analyze a property/casualty insurer's underwriting performance is the combined ratio based upon generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It is the sum of two ratios:\n\u2022The loss and loss expense ratio, which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue.\n\u2022The underwriting expense ratio, which measures underwriting expenses incurred (e.g., agents' commissions, premium taxes, and other administrative underwriting expenses) as a percentage of premium revenue.\nThe results of these ratios by significant component for the past two years were as follows:\n\nMaintaining a combined ratio below 100%, which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit, depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic coast, strict underwriting of risks, catastrophe reinsurance costs, severe thunderstorm frequency and the ability to obtain adequate and timely premium rates. A major hurricane hitting the coast of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi or Louisiana could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from year to year. In addition, most of the states that we write business are prone to severe thunderstorm and tornado activity with significant variations in the level of activity from year to year. The property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe; however, the geography of our coverage area, frequency of smaller catastrophe events and prohibitive cost of maintaining lower catastrophe deductibles and/or catastrophe aggregate coverage prevents some limitations on our ability to further mitigate catastrophe risks.\nDuring 2020, the P&C segment experienced an increase of 26.0 percentage points in the combined ratio compared to 2019. Catastrophe losses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, leading to a 31.32 percentage point increase in the P&C segment combined ratio and was the primary reason for the overall increase. Non-catastrophe losses decreased the P&C segment combined ratio 4.80 percentage points in the current year compared to the same period last year. As noted in the table above, catastrophe loss is the primary source of variability in our combined ratio and is generally the primary driver of variability in our earnings. While catastrophe events are unpredictable and often occur in cycles, management has sought to increase margins through efficiency measures and improved rate optimization. Management continues to improve rate adequacy, reduce significant exposure concentrations and implement other risk management strategies in order to further improve underwriting profitability, mitigate earnings volatility and reduce downside risk to our capital position.\nNon-insurance Operations:\nThe non-insurance operations of the Company consist of our ultimate holding company parent, The National Security Group, Inc. (NSEC). NSEC, as a standalone entity, has no material sources of revenue and relies on dividends and management service fees from our insurance subsidiaries to pay expenses. Dividends from subsidiaries are subject to insurance department approval and are also subject to statutory restrictions. Subsidiary dividends and service fees are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financial statements included herein. Revenues and expense (excluding intercompany dividends from subsidiaries) for non-insurance operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:\nRevenue for non-insurance operations primarily consists of interest on investments and other income. Other income is composed of management service fees from subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation. General and administrative expenses totaled $892,000 in 2020 compared to $1,128,000 for the same period last\nyear. The expenses of NSG are primarily associated with the public listing of our stock, taxes and fees, and directors' fees. The most significant item impacting the decline in general expenses was a decrease in the liability for unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Total interest expense associated with short-term and long-term borrowings of NSG was $823,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1,122,000 for the same period in 2019. The Company entered into two interest rates swaps during 2020 to reduce the rate of interest paid on its trust preferred securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the interest rate swaps. A reduction in debt outstanding was also a factor in the decline in interest expense.\nInvestments:\nThe insurance subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities. The types of assets in which the Company can invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets. While working within the parameters of these regulatory requirements and further considering liquidity and capital needs, the Company considers investment quality, investment return, asset/liability matching and composition of the investment portfolio when making investment decisions.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company's holdings in fixed maturity securities amounted to 83% of total investments and 54.7% of total assets. The Company utilizes the ratings of various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations when classifying fixed maturity investments by credit quality.\nThe following is a breakdown of the Company's fixed maturity investments by quality rating:\n\nThere were no material changes in credit quality mix in 2020 as we continue to focus on investing in high quality investment grade securities. Also, tight credit spreads throughout 2020 limited the rewards of investing in lower quality issues.\nOur holdings in below investment grade securities are primarily comprised of energy sector investments and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's). We have evaluated our current below investment grade holdings for potential impairment, along with any other security with a market value substantially below our amortized cost. We currently have no investment below 80% of amortized cost and based on presently available information, we do not believe any below investment grade securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. We also currently have no fixed income investments in default.\nThe amortized cost and aggregate fair values of investments in investment securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows:\n\n\nAs shown in the tables above, the Company experienced an increase in unrealized gains in fixed maturity securities in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase is primarily driven by the decline in interest rates and tightening of corporate bond spreads in the fixed maturity investment portfolio.\nA number of factors influence portfolio allocation within each of the insurance subsidiaries. Within the property and casualty subsidiaries, due to the relatively short-term nature of segment liabilities, fixed income investments tend to be of shorter duration, with average maturities of less than five years. Also, due to higher levels of potential volatility of policy liabilities (severe weather related losses), a greater emphasis is placed upon overall liquidity of investments. In contrast, within the life insurance subsidiary, policy liabilities tend to be more stable and of significantly longer duration. In order to match the longer duration of liabilities, investments in the life insurance portfolio tend to have longer maturities, and higher average book yields. Also, less emphasis is placed upon short-term liquidity in the life subsidiary due to more predictable cash needs.\nA downside of investing in longer duration securities in the life segment is that the portfolio is exposed to more significant price volatility as market interest rates rise. This exposure to sudden interest rate changes can lead to\ndeclines in market value of fixed income securities in a rising interest rate environment. Management currently maintains the life insurance portfolio in the intermediate duration range of 6.0 to guard against the adverse impact of rising rates. However, due to the necessity of matching the longer duration of life policy liabilities as closely as possible in order to pass regulatory cash flow testing and avoid significant interest rate speculation in the asset liability matching process, some volatility in market value of the portfolio in a rising rate environment cannot be avoided.\nAt December 31, 2020, 6.5% of total investments in the fixed income portfolio were classified as below investment grade. In evaluating whether or not the equity loss positions were other-than-temporary impairments, management evaluated financial information on each company and, where available, reviewed analyst reports from independent sources. Based on a review of the available financial information, the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the Company's intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered, it was determined that the securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments. Management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company realized $180,000 in other-than-temporary impairments related to fixed maturities.\nThe amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity, are as follows. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the majority of our longer duration securities are investments made to match longer duration liabilities in the life segment or are investments in mortgage backed securities, primarily government agency. Due to the amortizing nature and the ability to prepay mortgage backed securities, actual maturities tend to be significantly shorter than contractual maturities.\nInvestment portfolio income\nInvestment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\n\nAverage current yield on investments in 2020 remained unchanged compared to 2019. The total return on investments in 2020 was 6.6% compared to 10.2% in 2019. Increases in market value of fixed maturity investments due to declines in market interest rates was a primary driver of total return on investments in 2020. A gain on our\ncompany owned life insurance investment coupled with interest rate driven increases in value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale were the primary factors driving the higher total return in 2019 compared 2020.\nRepurchase agreements\nThe Company's subsidiaries maintain repurchase agreements for cash held on deposit under which insurance regulations dictates that our policy requires 102% (100% minimum) of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral. The repurchase investments are overnight agreements and investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid. Therefore, these investments are reflected on the balance sheet as cash equivalents. Due to a combination of the 102% collateral requirement and low short-term interest rates, we realize limited interest income from repurchase agreements/short-term investments. However, repurchase agreements utilizing government agency securities do provide deposit protection for short-term cash held in excess of FDIC deposit limits. The Company does not lend securities to any counterparty under repurchase agreements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nDue to regulatory restrictions, the majority of the Company's cash is required to be invested primarily in investment-grade securities to provide protection for policyholders. The liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms, and therefore, those subsidiaries invest in securities with various effective maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding 10 years with an average portfolio duration typically of less than 5 years. The liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration, and therefore, a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding 10 years.\nThe liquidity requirements for the Company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. All operations and virtually all investments are maintained by the insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property/casualty businesses, while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits, the cost of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, purchases of new investments, and in the case of life insurance, policy loans.\nVirtually all invested assets of the Company are held in the insurance subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the contractual maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the Company, stated at amortized cost, was as follows:\n\nIt should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated/contractual maturity. Due to call and prepayment features inherent in some fixed maturity securities, actual repayment, or effective maturities, will differ from stated maturities. The Company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk. However, due to other factors, both regulatory and those associated with good investment management practices associated with asset/liability matching, we do have exposure to changes in market values of securities due to changes in interest rates. Currently, a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates would generate approximately a $3,826,000, or 4.7%, decline in the market value of fixed maturity investments. Alternatively, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates will generate approximately $3,638,000, or 4.5%, increase in market value of fixed income investments. Management has attempted, to the extent possible, to reduce risk in a rising rate environment. However, due to asset/liability matching requirements, particularly in the life subsidiary portfolio, interest rate risk can not be eliminated and exposure to market volatility can cause some variability in our accumulated other comprehensive income, total return on investments, total shareholders' equity and book value per share.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had aggregate equity capital, unrealized investment gains (net of income taxes) and retained earnings of $45,366,000, down $8,095,000, compared to $53,461,000 at December 31,\n2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, shareholders' equity was decreased by a net loss of $8,619,000, increased by comprehensive income due to changes in value of fixed maturity securities of $1,580,000 and decreased by a comprehensive loss of $438,000 related to change in value of interest rate swaps. Equity was also increased by common stock issued of $25,000. Equity was reduced $36,000 by the purchase of 2,509 common stock shares held as treasury stock and by cash dividends paid totaling $607,000.\nAs discussed above, changing interest rates can have a significant impact on the market value of fixed maturity investments. Fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale increase the liquidity resources of the Company as they can be sold at any time to pay claims or meet other Company obligations. However, these securities are required to be carried at market value with net of tax change in accumulated unrealized gains and losses directly impacting shareholder's equity. While the increase in interest rates causes near term declines in the value of fixed income securities, we are able to reap the benefit of reinvesting at higher rates as current fixed income investments are called, amortized (mortgage backed securities) or reach contractual maturity. Over the next twelve months, based on cash flow projection modeling that considers such factors as anticipated principal payments on mortgage backed securities, likelihood of call provisions being enacted and regular contractual maturities, we expect approximately 8% of our current fixed income portfolio to be reinvested or otherwise available to meet Company obligations.\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $19,887,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $11,809,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash used in operating activities decreased cash by $13,890,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily related to the net loss for the period which was triggered by an increase in claims and claims related expenses in the P&C segment from spring storms during the second quarter and hurricane losses during the third and fourth quarters. Cash provided by operating activities increased cash by $5,373,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash from operating activities was driven by refunds of federal income tax overpayment along with changes in other assets and reinsurance recoveries. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $23,083,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,656,000 in 2019. The increase in cash from investing activities was related to maturities, some increases in prepayments on mortgage backed securities and sales of investments to maintain adequate liquidity to settle P&C segment hurricane claims. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 primarily consisted of maturities of investments in which reinvestment was delayed in order to increase liquidity during hurricane season. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,115,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $896,000 for the same period last year. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $607,000 in dividends to shareholders.\nThe Holding Company had $3,108,000 in cash at December 31, 2020. The Holding Company primarily relies on cash from subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including payment of dividends to shareholders along with interest and principal on outstanding debt. Currently the Holding Company has adequate liquidity on hand to meet its anticipated obligations through 2021 without additional dividend payments from subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 totaled $16,779,000.\nThe Company had a total of $13,177,000 of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, compared to $13,664,000 at December 31, 2019, which includes $12,372,000 in trust preferred securities issued by the Company in addition to the installment note. Current year and prior year amounts were reduced by the unamortized portion of the placement fees associated with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, $195,000 and $208,000, respectively.\n\nContractual obligations reflected in the table above include the issuance of $9,129,000 in subordinated debentures completed on December 15, 2005. The subordinated debentures mature December 15, 2035. It is anticipated that principal payments will not be made before maturity. Also included in long-term debt is the issuance of $3,035,000 in subordinated debentures on June 21, 2007. This issue matures June 15, 2037 and may be prepaid at any time. Also reflected in the table above is a $1,500,000 unsecured loan renewed in December 2019. The unsecured loan matures in November 2023.\nIn estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves, the Company utilized historical payment patterns. By the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist, there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above. However, management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due. Also, due to the relatively short-tail nature of the majority of the Company's property and casualty claim liabilities, management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately 97.5% of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period. See Note 9 for additional details on payout patterns.\nThe ability of the Company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends, in addition to current cash flow, on the liquidity of its investments. The Company has relatively little exposure to below investment grade fixed income investments, which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets.\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are primarily met by funds provided from operations of the insurance subsidiaries. The Company receives funds from its subsidiaries through payment of dividends, management fees, reimbursements for federal income taxes and reimbursement of expenses incurred at the corporate level for the subsidiaries. These funds are used to pay stockholder dividends, principal and interest on debt, corporate administrative expenses, federal income taxes, and for funding investments in the subsidiaries. The Company has no separate source of revenue other than dividends and fees from the insurance subsidiaries. Also, dividends from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and, therefore, are limited depending on capital levels and earnings of the subsidiaries.\nOur P&C segment is the primary source of dividends to the holding company. Consideration of insurance subsidiary growth opportunities, regulatory capital adequacy, rating agency impact and holding company debt reduction, among other items, are factors that influence our subsidiary dividend requirements. While we have made significant progress in recent years, continued strengthening capital levels in the insurance subsidiaries and reduction of debt remains a top priority. However, a decline in regulatory capital in our P&C subsidiary in 2020 due to increased catastrophe loss frequency will limit our ability to prepay any debt obligations beyond what is required for at least the next two years.\nDividends paid from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and prior approval of the Alabama Department of Insurance. As disclosed in Note 12 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the amount that The National Security Group's insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company during 2021 is statutorily limited to $1,168,000 in the life insurance subsidiary and $3,650,000 in the property/casualty insurance subsidiary. Dividends are limited to the greater of net income (operating income for life subsidiary) or 10% of statutory capital, and regulators consider dividends paid within the preceding twelve months when calculating the available dividend capacity. Therefore, all of the above referenced dividend capacity will not be available for consideration of payment until dividends paid in the preceding twelve months have been considered on a rolling basis. The Company also has to continuously evaluate other factors such as subsidiary operating performance, subsidiary capital requirements and potential impact by rating agencies in making decisions on how much capital can be released from insurance subsidiaries for payment of dividends to NSG. These factors are considered along with the goal of growing year over year statutory surplus in the subsidiaries, and these considerations along with potential adverse impacts on regulatory surplus, will likely lead to dividend payments to NSG substantially below the above referenced regulatory maximums. The Company received $1,100,000 in dividends from its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to a decline in statutory surplus in our P&C subsidiaries during 2020, the result of increased in catastrophe losses, we do not expect to pay any dividends from these subsidiaries for at least the next twelve months as our primary focus will be on rebuilding statutory surplus.\nThe Company's subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs, claims, other policy benefits, interest expense, general expenses, and dividends to the Company. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities, calls, and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash for both subsidiaries. A significant portion of the Company's investment portfolio, which is held by the insurance subsidiaries, consists of readily marketable securities, which can be sold for cash.\nThe Company continues to monitor liquidity and subsidiary capital closely. Despite challenging weather patterns in the property and casualty subsidiaries over the past three years, the insurance subsidiaries are well capitalized. However, further strengthening of subsidiary capital continues to be a top priority for management.\nExcept as discussed above, the Company is unaware of any known trends, events, or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity, capital resources, or operations. Additionally, the Company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities, which if implemented, would have such an effect.\nStatutory Risk-Based Capital of Insurance Subsidiaries:\nThe NAIC has adopted Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements for life/health and property/casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality, mortality and morbidity, asset and liability matching, benefit and loss reserve adequacy, and other business factors. State insurance regulators will use the RBC formula as an early warning tool to identify, for the purpose of initiating regulatory action, insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized. In addition, the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state-by-state basis. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the Company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels, each of which requires corrective action.\nThe levels and ratios are as follows:\nRatio of Total Adjusted Capital to\nAuthorized Control Level RBC\nRegulatory Event (Less Than or Equal to)\nCompany action level 2.0\nRegulatory action level 1.5\nAuthorized control level 1.0\nMandatory control level 0.7\nThe ratios of Total Adjusted Capital to Authorized Control Level RBC for The National Security Group's life/health and property/casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of 4 to 1 at December 31, 2020.\nNational Security Insurance Company (life insurer) has regulatory adjusted capital of $10,784,000 and $17,210,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 8.9 and 15.0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, National Security Insurance Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nNational Security Fire & Casualty Company (property/casualty insurer) has regulatory adjusted capital of $36,505,000 and $36,264,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 4.8 and 5.1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, National Security Fire & Casualty Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nOmega One Insurance Company (property/casualty insurer), which began writing business in late 1995, has regulatory adjusted capital of $7,083,000 and $11,430,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level RBC of 12.7 and 20.1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, Omega One Insurance Company exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies:\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies may be based on (including but not limited to) GAAP authoritative literature, statutory authoritative literature, regulations and industry standards. The Company's financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies. It is management's opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022Reinsurance\n\u2022Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n\u2022Income Taxes\n\u2022Fair Values of Financial Instruments\n\u2022Claim Liabilities\n\u2022Recognition of Revenue\n\u2022Contingencies\nReinsurance\nRisk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements. The reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts. Although the reinsurance protects our Company in the event a loss exceeds retention limits specified in a particular reinsurance agreement; ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our Company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due. We record an asset for reinsurance recoverable in the financial statements for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible. If we discover an amount due may not be received, we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time.\nWhen a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured, we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant. Subsequently, we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contract.\nReinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed $50,000 for any one insured.\nDuring 2020, the property and casualty segment maintained a catastrophe reinsurance contract, which covered losses exceeding a retention related to a single catastrophic event. In the event a catastrophe exceeded the $4 million company retention stated in the contract, reinsurers would reimburse the company 100% of gross losses up to the upper limits of the reinsurance agreement, which was $72.5 million in 2020 and 2019. Any losses above the $72.5 million upper limit are the responsibility of our Company. The contract in place during 2020 also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event with the same upper $72.5 million upper limit but with a reduced retention of $2 million due to placement of an aggregate Layer of coverage of $2 million in excess of a $2 million event minimum subject to a $2 million aggregate annual deductible.\nThe property and casualty subsidiaries utilize our actual in force policy data modeled utilizing two different industry accepted catastrophe models to structure catastrophe reinsurance and determine upper limits of catastrophe\nreinsurance agreements. Historically, reinsurance has been maintained to meet at least a 250 year modeled event level. While this estimate is subject to some uncertainty and model risk, through obtaining coverage that meets at least a 250 year modeled event level, the models indicate that we maintain catastrophe reinsurance upper limits to cover an event that has less than a 0.5% probability of occurring in a given year.\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was $6,874,000 compared to $276,000 for the same period last year. The Company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount. In 2020, catastrophe reinsurance premiums ceded totaled $6,274,000 compared to $6,008,000 ceded in 2019. Catastrophe reinsurance premiums are based on a premium calculation applying the agreed upon rate to the total insured value of the covered lines of business. In addition to catastrophe reinsurance, the Company placed reinstatement premium protection (RPP) reinsurance during 2020 and 2019 totaling $1,022,000 and $1,033,000, respectively.\nThe reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management's interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty. Areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include: assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed.\nThere is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded. This possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties, such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable. Management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability. For more information regarding reinsurance, see the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business. DAC is primarily comprised of commissions, premium taxes, and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception; rather, they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies.\nA reduction in DAC is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs, and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income. Management reviews DAC calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability. Changes in management's assumptions, estimates or judgment with respect to calculating DAC could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition. Changes in loss ratios, projected investment income, premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of DAC.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $7,408,000 and $7,666,000, respectively, as an asset for DAC in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs. For more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted.\nAt December 31, 2020, there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable. For more information regarding deferred income taxes, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates all tax positions taken on its U.S. federal income tax return. No material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the Company.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nInvestments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available. Quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements. Further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Periodically, the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value, volatility, credit quality and existing market conditions. Management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Evaluation criteria include credit quality of security, severity of decrease between cost and market value, length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future. This evaluation requires significant assumptions, estimates and judgments by management. If the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement. We have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments.\nClaim Liabilities\nProperty and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims. Loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry. Reserves are management's expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost. Management's estimate of reserves are based on historical settlement patterns, estimated salvage and subrogation, and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances. Management's reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness. The reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review performed at year-end.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded liability for loss and loss adjustment expense was $10,177,000 and $7,199,000, respectively, a $2,978,000 increase. The increase in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves is primarily due to claims outstanding from third and fourth quarter hurricanes at December 31, 2020. We believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices. For more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecognition of Revenue\nLife insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due. Property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Unearned premiums represent that portion of direct premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policy contracts in force and is reported as a liability. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as an asset.\nContingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from, but not limited to, litigation, claims, assessments, fines and penalties are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated. Significant attorney fees are estimated and recorded when incurred. Additional details with respect to contingencies are disclosed in Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

contractual maturity. Interest on long-term debt is calculated using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020 for each issue. Interest on long-term debt is accrued and settled quarterly on the trust preferred securities, monthly on the line of credit and annually on the installment note. Therefore, the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above. These calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments. For additional information regarding long-term debt and interest on long-term debt, please see Note 8, Notes Payable and Long-term Debt, in the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 The anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves, which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses, are based upon historical payout patterns. Both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated. For additional details on payout patterns please see Note 9.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 Future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies in force at December 31, 2020. These estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. In contrast to this table, the majority of NSIC's obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Management believes that current assets, future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- The Company operates in two segments: Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance and Life, Accident & Health insurance. The P&C segment is the largest, accounting for 91.5% of gross premiums in 2020.\n\n- In 2020, the Company had a net loss of $8.6 million compared to net income of $4.1 million in 2019, primarily due to a significant increase in P&C claims from catastrophic weather events.\n\nP&C Operations\n- P&C net premiums earned increased 2.0% in 2020 driven by rate increases in the dwelling fire insurance program.  \n\n- Catastrophe losses were $24.2 million in 2020 compared to $6.6 million in 2019. This led to a 126.1% GAAP combined ratio for the P&C segment in 2020.\n\n- The increase in catastrophe losses resulted in a pretax loss of $12.0 million for the P&C segment compared to pretax income of $3.8 million in 2019.\n\nInvestments\n- At December 31, 2020, 83% of investments were in fixed maturities. 37.2% of the fixed income portfolio was rated AAA/AA+.\n\n- Net investment income was down slightly in 2020 primarily due to lower portfolio yields on fixed income reinvestments.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Shareholders' equity decreased by $8.1 million in 2020 to $45.4 million, driven by the net loss.\n\n- Increased P&C claims have reduced the ability to upstream dividends from the insurance subsidiaries over the next 12 months. Rebuilding capital is a priority.  \n\n- All insurance subsidiaries exceeded minimum RBC requirements at December 31, 2020."}
