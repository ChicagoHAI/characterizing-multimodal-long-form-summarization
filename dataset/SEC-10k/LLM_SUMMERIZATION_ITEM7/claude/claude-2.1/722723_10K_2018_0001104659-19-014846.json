MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K including this \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (or \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis\u201d) contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our liquidity and our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies. These statements often include words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d or similar words. These statements are based on certain assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative, that may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports.\nThese statements involve risks, estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements and elsewhere in this report, and any claims, investigations, or proceedings arising as a result, as well as our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d contained elsewhere in this report; any regulatory review of, or litigation relating to, our accounting practices, financial statements, and other financial data, periodic reports, or other corporate actions; changes in the demand for our orthotic and prosthetic (\u201cO&P\u201d) products and services, uncertainties relating to the results of operations or our acquired O&P patient care clinics, our ability to enter into and derive benefits from managed-care contracts, our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified O&P clinicians, federal laws governing the health care industry, uncertainties inherent in investigations and legal proceedings, governmental policies affecting O&P operations, and other risks and uncertainties generally affecting the health care industry.\nReaders are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those described in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, some of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those contemplated by any forward-looking statement. In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements in this discussion to reflect events and circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect unanticipated events. Forward-looking statements and our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected by the risks set forth in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or by other unknown risks and uncertainties.\nEffect of Delay in Financial Filings\nBeginning with Q3 of 2014 through Q1 of 2018, we were delayed in the preparation and filing of our financial statements. In connection with our efforts to restate our prior financial statements, remediate our material weaknesses, regain our timely filing status, and undertake related activities, we have incurred third party professional fees in excess of the amounts we estimate that we would have otherwise incurred. The estimated professional fees associated with these efforts are as follows:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Balance to be Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expensed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> in Future Periods\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,917\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 10,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 3,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we expended a total of $12.5 million in excess professional fees for the primary purpose of remediating our continuing material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Due to the ongoing material weaknesses in our controls over financial reporting, we currently undertake additional substantive procedures to test and verify financial statement amounts in connection with the preparation of our financial statements. We currently estimate that we will incur an additional $5.1 million of such excess fees during 2019. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe refer to certain financial measures and statistics that are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We utilize these non-GAAP measures in order to evaluate the underlying factors that affect our business performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have defined and provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis are as follows:\nAdjusted Gross Revenue and Disallowed Revenue - \u201cAdjusted gross revenue\u201d reflects our gross billings after their adjustment to reflect estimated discounts established in our contracts with payors of health care claims. Pursuant to our contracts with payors, a portion of our adjusted gross billings may be disallowed based on factors including physician documentation, patient eligibility, plan design, prior authorization, timeliness of filings or appeal, coding selection, failure by certain patients to pay their portion of claims, computational errors associated with sequestration, and other factors. We refer to these and other amounts as being \u201cdisallowed revenue\u201d or \u201cpayor disallowances.\u201d Our net revenue reflects adjusted gross revenue after reduction for the estimated aggregate amount of disallowed revenue for the applicable period. To facilitate analysis of the comparability of our results, we provide these non-GAAP measures due to the significant changes that we have experienced in recent years in disallowed revenue which are further discussed below.\nSame Clinic Revenues Per Day - measures the year-over-year change in revenue from clinics that have been open a full calendar year or more; examples of clinics not included in the same clinic population are closures and acquisitions. Day-adjusted growth normalizes sales for the number of days a clinic was open in each comparable period.\nOverview\nBusiness Overview\nGeneral\nWe are a leading national provider of products and services that assist in enhancing or restoring the physical capabilities of patients with disabilities or injuries. Built on the legacy of James Edward Hanger, the first amputee of the American Civil War, we and our predecessor companies have provided O&P services for over 150 years. We provide O&P services, distribute O&P devices and components, manage O&P networks, and provide therapeutic solutions to patients and businesses in acute, post-acute, and clinic settings. We operate through two segments - Patient Care and Products & Services.\nOur Patient Care segment is primarily comprised of Hanger Clinic, which specializes in the design, fabrication, and delivery of custom O&P devices through 676 patient care clinics and 104 satellite locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018. We also provide payor network contracting services to other O&P providers through this segment.\nOur Products & Services segment is comprised of our distribution services and our therapeutic solutions businesses. As a leading provider of O&P products in the United States, we coordinate, through our distribution services business, the procurement and distribution of a broad catalog of O&P parts, componentry, and devices to independent O&P providers nationwide. To facilitate speed and convenience, we deliver these products through our five distribution facilities that are located in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The other business in our Products & Services segment is our therapeutic solutions business, which develops specialized rehabilitation technologies and provides evidence-based clinical programs for post-acute rehabilitation to patients at approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our net revenues were $1,048.8 million, $1,040.8 million, and $1,042.1 million, respectively. We recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million, $104.7 million, and $107.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIndustry Overview\nWe estimate that approximately $4.2 billion is spent in the United States each year for orthotic and prosthetic products and services. We estimate that our Patient Care segment currently accounts for approximately 20% of market share, providing a comprehensive portfolio of orthotic, prosthetic, and post-operative solutions to patients in acute, post-acute, and patient care clinic settings.\nThe traditional O&P patient care industry is highly fragmented and is characterized by local, independent O&P businesses. We do not believe that any single competitor accounts for more than 2% of the country's total estimated O&P patient care clinic revenues.\nThe industry is characterized by stable, recurring revenues, primarily resulting from new patients as well as the need for periodic replacement and modification of O&P devices. We anticipate that the demand for O&P services will continue to grow as the nation's population increases, and as a result of several trends, including the aging of the U.S. population, there will be an increase in the prevalence of disease-related disability and the demand for new and advanced devices. We believe the typical replacement time for prosthetic devices is three to five years, while the typical replacement time for orthotic devices varies, depending on the device.\nWe estimate that approximately $1.7 billion is spent in the United States each year by providers of O&P patient care services for the O&P products, components, devices, and supplies used in their businesses. Our Products & Services segment distributes to independent providers of O&P services and to our own patient care clinics. We estimate that our distribution sales account for approximately 8% of the market for O&P products, components, devices, and supplies (excluding sales to our Patient Care segment).\nWe estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, integrated clinical programs, and clinician training in skilled nursing facilities (\u201cSNFs\u201d) to be approximately $150 million annually. We currently provide these products and services to approximately 24% of the estimated 15,000 SNFs located in the U.S. We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, clinical programs, and training within the broader post-acute rehabilitation markets to be approximately $400 million annually. We do not currently provide a meaningful amount of products and services to this broader market.\nBusiness Description\nPatient Care\nOur Patient Care segment employs approximately 1,500 clinical prosthetists, orthotists, and pedorthists, which we refer to as clinicians, substantially all of which are certified by either the American Board for Certification (\u201cABC\u201d) or the Board of Certification of Orthotists and Prosthetists, which are the two boards that certify O&P clinicians. To facilitate timely service to our patients, we also employ technicians, fitters, and other ancillary providers to assist its clinicians in the performance of their duties. Through this segment, we additionally provide network contracting services to independent providers of O&P through our \u201cLinkia\u201d business.\nPatients are typically referred to Hanger Clinic by an attending physician who determines a patient's treatment and writes a prescription. Our clinicians then consult with both the referring physician and the patient with a view toward assisting in the design of an orthotic or prosthetic device to meet the patient's needs. O&P devices are increasingly technologically advanced and custom designed to add functionality and comfort to patients' lives, shorten the rehabilitation process, and lower the cost of rehabilitation.\nBased on the prescription written by a referring physician, our clinicians examine and evaluate the patient and either design a custom device or, in the case of certain orthotic needs, utilize a non-custom device, including, in appropriate circumstances, an \u201coff the shelf\u201d device, to address the patient's needs. When fabricating a device, our clinicians ascertain the specific requirements, componentry, and measurements necessary for the construction of the device. Custom devices are constructed using componentry provided by a variety of third party manufacturers who specialize in O&P, coupled with sockets and other elements that are fabricated by our clinicians and technicians, to meet the individual patient's physical and ambulatory needs. Our clinicians and technicians typically utilize castings, electronic scans, and other techniques to fabricate items that are specialized for the patient. After fabricating the device, a fitting process is undertaken and adjustments are made to ensure the achievement of proper alignment, fit, and patient comfort. The fitting process often involves several stages to successfully achieve desired functional and cosmetic results.\nGiven the differing physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prosthesis and orthosis is customized for each particular patient. These custom devices are commonly fabricated at one of our regional or national fabrication facilities.\nWe have earned a reputation within the O&P industry for the development and use of innovative technology in our products, which has increased patient comfort and capability and can significantly enhance the rehabilitation process. Frequently, our proprietary Insignia scanning system is used in the fabrication process. The Insignia system scans the patient and produces an accurate computer-generated image, resulting in a faster turnaround for the patient's device and a more professional overall experience.\nIn recent years, we have established a centralized revenue cycle management organization that assists our clinics in pre-authorization, patient eligibility, denial management, collections, payor audit coordination, and other accounts receivable processes.\nThe principal reimbursement sources for our services are:\n\u00b7 Commercial private payors and other non-governmental organizations, which consist of individuals, rehabilitation providers, commercial insurance companies, health management organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d), preferred provider organizations (\u201cPPOs\u201d), hospitals, vocational rehabilitation centers, workers' compensation programs, third party administrators, and similar sources;\n\u00b7 Medicare, a federally funded health insurance program providing health insurance coverage for persons aged 65 or older and certain disabled persons;\n\u00b7 Medicaid, a health insurance program jointly funded by federal and state governments providing health insurance coverage for certain persons based upon financial need, regardless of age, which may supplement Medicare benefits for financially needy persons aged 65 or older; and\n\u00b7 the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nWe typically enter into contracts with third party payors that allow us to perform O&P services for a referred patient and to be paid under the contract with the third party payor. These contracts usually have a stated term of one to three years. These contracts generally may be terminated without cause by either party on 60 to 90 days' notice or on 30 days' notice if we have not complied with certain licensing, certification, program standards, Medicare or Medicaid requirements, or other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement for services is typically based on a fee schedule negotiated with the third party payor that reflects various factors, including market conditions, geographic area, and number of persons covered. Many of our commercial contracts are indexed to the commensurate Medicare fee schedule that relates to the products or services being provided.\nGovernment reimbursement is comprised of Medicare, Medicaid, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d.) These payors set maximum reimbursement levels for O&P services and products. Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (\u201cCPI-U\u201d) unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment. The CPI-U is adjusted further by an efficiency factor (the \u201cProductivity Adjustment\u201d) in order to determine the final rate adjustment each year. There can be no assurance that future adjustments will not reduce reimbursements for O&P services and products from these sources.\nWe, and the O&P industry in general, are subject to various Medicare compliance audits, including Recovery Audit Contractor (\u201cRAC\u201d) audits, Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (\u201cCERT\u201d) audits, Targeted Probe and Educate (\u201cTPE\u201d) audits, and Zone Program Integrity Contractor (\u201cZPIC\u201d) audits. TPE audits are generally pre-payment audits, while RAC, CERT, and ZPIC audits are generally post-payment audits. TPE audits replaced the previous Medicare Administrative Contractor audits. Adverse post-payment audit determinations generally require Hanger to reimburse Medicare for payments previously made, while adverse pre-payment audit determinations generally result in the denial of payment. In either case, we can request a redetermination or appeal, if we believe the adverse determination is unwarranted, which can take an extensive period of time to resolve, currently up to six years or more.\nProducts & Services\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Prosthetic Supply, Inc. (\u201cSPS\u201d), we distribute O&P components to independent providers of O&P and other customers. This componentry is provided by our supply chain operations, through which we procure, warehouse, and distribute over 400,000 SKUs from more than 300 different manufacturers. Our warehousing and distribution facilities in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas, are able to deliver products to the majority of our customers in the United States within two business days. Through its SureFit subsidiary, SPS also manufactures and sells therapeutic footwear for diabetic patients in the podiatric market.\nOur supply chain operations are an internal support organization that serves both SPS and our Patient Care clinics by procuring, warehousing, and distributing componentry. This organization enables us to:\n\u00b7 centralize our purchasing and thus lower our material costs by negotiating purchasing discounts from manufacturers;\n\u00b7 better manage our patient care clinic inventory levels and improve inventory turns;\n\u00b7 improve inventory quality control;\n\u00b7 encourage our patient care clinics to use the most clinically appropriate products; and\n\u00b7 coordinate new product development efforts with key vendors.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accelerated Care Plus Corp., our therapeutic solutions business is a leading provider of rehabilitation technologies and integrated clinical programs to post-acute care and rehabilitation providers. Our unique value proposition is to provide our customers with a full-service \u201ctotal solutions\u201d approach encompassing proven medical technology, evidence based clinical programs, and ongoing clinician education and training. Our services support increasingly advanced treatment options for a broader patient population and more medically complex conditions. We serve approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.\nReimbursement Trends\nIn our Patient Care segment, we are reimbursed primarily through employer-based plans offered by commercial insurance carriers, Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA. The following is a summary of our payor mix, expressed as an approximate percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 14.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Insurance/Managed Care (excluding Medicare and Medicaid Managed Care)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Veterans Administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care constitutes 81.8%, 81.9%, and 80.6% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively. Our remaining net revenue is from our Products & Services segment which derives its net revenue from commercial transactions with independent O&P providers, healthcare facilities, and other customers. In contrast to net revenues from our Patient Care segment, payment for these products and services are not directly subject to third party reimbursement from health care payors.\nThe amount of our reimbursement varies based on the nature of the O&P device we fabricate for our patients. Given the particular physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prostheses and orthoses is customized for each particular patient. The nature of this customization and the manner by which our claims submissions are reviewed by payors makes our reimbursement process administratively difficult.\nTo receive reimbursement for our work, we must ensure that our clinical, administrative, and billing personnel receive and verify certain medical and health plan information, record detailed documentation regarding the services we provide, and accurately and timely perform a number of claims submission and related administrative tasks. Traditionally, we have performed these tasks in a manual fashion and on a decentralized basis. In recent years, due to increases in payor pre-authorization processes, documentation requirements, pre-payment reviews, and pre- and post-payment audits, our ability to successfully undertake these tasks using our traditional approach has become increasingly challenging. We believe these changes in industry trends have been brought about in part by increased nationwide efforts to reduce health care costs.\nA measure of our effectiveness in securing reimbursement for our services can be found in the degree to which payors ultimately disallow payment of our claims. Payors can deny claims due to their determination that a physician who referred a patient to us did not sufficiently document that a device was medically necessary or clearly establish the ambulatory (or \u201cactivity\u201d) level of a patient. Claims can also be denied based on our failure to ensure that a patient was currently eligible under a payor's health plan, that the plan provides full O&P benefits, that we received prior authorization, that we filed or appealed the payor's determination timely, on the basis of our coding, failure by certain classes of patients to pay their portion of a claim, and for various other reasons. If any portion of, or administrative factor within, our claim is found by the payor to be lacking, then the entirety of the claim amount may be denied reimbursement. Due to the increasing demands of these processes, the level and capability of our staffing, as well as our material weaknesses and other considerations, our consolidated disallowed revenue and its relationship to consolidated adjusted gross revenue increased over historical levels to a peak level in 2014.\nCommencing in late 2014 and continuing through today, we have taken a number of actions to halt and reverse these disallowed revenue trends. These initiatives included: (i) the retention of consultants and creation of a central revenue cycle management function; (ii) addressing the issues identified in our patient management and electronic health record system; and (iii) the establishment of new clinic-level procedures and training regarding the collection of supporting documentation and the importance of diligence in our claims submission processes. While we continue to work towards further improvements in our procedures through the use of technology within our clinic and revenue cycle functions, we do not currently foresee that future reductions in disallowed revenue will be achievable or substantial as the improvements realized from 2014 through 2017. We saw disallowed rates in 2018 slightly above 2017 levels.\nUnder both ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), and the previous revenue recognition guidance ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (\u201cASC 605\u201d), disallowed revenue is considered an adjustment to the transaction price, or an implicit price concession. However, upon adoption of ASC 606 in 2018, estimated uncollectible amounts due to us by patients are considered implicit price concessions and are now presented as a reduction of net revenue, whereas under ASC 605, estimated uncollectible amounts were recognized as bad debt expense in other operating costs. These amounts recorded in net revenue within the Patient Care segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the

submission, collection, cash application and claims audit support activities (our \u201crevenue cycle management\u201d functions) primarily on a decentralized location by location basis. Due to the increases experienced in disallowed revenue, as well as to address certain procedural requirements of our new patient management and electronic health record system and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our revenue cycle management functions, during 2014 we commenced the process of establishing a centralized revenue cycle management organization with the strategy to gradually transition these functions from our decentralized clinics to a centralized organization. We have continued to expand this initiative through fiscal year 2018.\nAs discussed in the \u201cReimbursement Trends\u201d section above, we have experienced decreases in our disallowed revenue subsequent to the establishment of our revenue cycle management function when compared to 2014. In addition to other training and claims documentation initiatives, we believe that decreases we have experienced in disallowed revenue (as well as our overall accounts receivables balances) are due in part to our revenue cycle management initiative.\nFavorable Settlements\nFor year ended December 31, 2018, our results of operations and net income benefited from the favorable resolution of two matters.\nOn May 15, 2018, we received a net favorable settlement of $1.7 million in connection with our long standing damage claims relating to the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d disaster, and the prior adverse effect which it had on our clinic operations along the Gulf Coast in April of 2010. We do not anticipate further payments in connection with this matter as this settlement constituted a full and final satisfaction of our claims. The benefit of this settlement has been recognized as a reduction to our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn June 28, 2018, we entered into an agreement with the State of Delaware, and made payment, to satisfy all of the State's abandoned or unclaimed property claims transactions represented within the period of January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2012 which were reportable through December 31, 2017 in the amount of $2.2 million. This agreed upon payment amount was favorable by $0.5 million to the amount we had previously estimated for these liabilities and had the effect of reducing our general and administrative expenses by this amount for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, we were not required to pay interest on the previously unremitted cumulative abandoned or unclaimed property relating to this twelve year period in the amount of $1.5 million, which had the effect of lowering our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 by this accrued interest amount.\nNew System Implementation\nIn recent years we have been undertaking the implementation of a new patient management and electronic health record system at our patient care clinics. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the installation of this system in approximately 95% of our clinic locations with the plan to convert the remaining locations to the system by mid-2019. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we expensed $4.4 million, $4.3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, in training, travel, and related implementation costs. In 2019, and for the foreseeable future, we currently estimate that we will continue to expense similar amounts for the implementation of new information technology systems. In 2019, in addition to expenses we will incur in connection with the completion of the implementation of our new patient management and health record system, we also currently plan to undertake other projects related to certain new financial and supply chain systems.\nClinic-Level Claims Documentation\nIn addition to our revenue cycle management initiatives and resolution of the aforementioned issues associated with our implementation of our new electronic health record and patient management system, in 2016 we commenced more intensive training and increased our internal clinic-level emphasis on the importance of adherence to procedural and documentation standards. The absence of sufficient documentation establishing medical necessity and a patient's degree of ability for future activity is a key factor utilized by payors when denying our claims for reimbursement. Irrespective of a patient's need and the existence of a referral from the treating physician, we have found it increasingly necessary to retrieve other supporting documentation and notes from referring physicians themselves to further justify and document their medical determinations relating to the patients they refer to us. Given that these referring physicians do not work for us, the retrieval of this additional information to suit payors can be difficult and time-consuming.\nWe believe our efforts to increase our discipline through this clinic-level claims documentation initiative assisted us in further reducing the level of our disallowed sales. However, we also believe these efforts had a one-time indirect effect of reducing our overall revenue growth rate. In addition to other factors affecting our same clinic sales trends in 2016 and early 2017, as clinicians and their office administrators increased their attention on achieving higher documentation standards, we believe we were able to see and treat fewer patients, thereby contributing to our reduced same clinic patient care net revenue.\nWe continued to apply these procedural and documentation standards throughout 2018 and plan to continue to do so in 2019. With the initial implementation impact behind us, we do not believe the use of these standards was a significant factor on our year-over-year growth in 2018, nor do we expect them to be in 2019.\nIncreasing Patient Responsibility for the Cost of Devices\nThe majority of our devices are provided as replacement devices to patients with devices that are broken or have become worn with age. Prosthetic devices are typically replaced every three to five years. In recent years, an increasing number of employers have been shifting the cost burdens in their health plans to employees through use of \u201chigh deductible\u201d or \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d health plans. These plan designs typically require the patient to bear a greater portion of the cost of their care in exchange for a lower monthly premium. We believe the increased use of these plans has and will continue to have the effect of causing patients to delay the replacement of their devices and could accordingly adversely impact our net revenue.\nProducts & Services Segment Trends\nIn 2017, several of the larger independent O&P providers we served through the distribution of componentry encountered financial difficulties which resulted in our discontinuing distribution services to them. Generally, we believe our distribution customers encounter reimbursement pressures similar to those we experience in our own Patient Care services and, depending on their ability to adapt to the increased claims documentation standards that have emerged in our industry, that this may either limit the rate of growth of some of our customers, or otherwise affect the rate of growth we experience in our distribution of O&P componentry to independent providers.\nWithin our Products & Services segment, in addition to our distribution of products, we provide therapeutic equipment and services to patients at SNFs and other healthcare provider locations. Since 2016, a number of our clients, including several of our larger SNF clients, began to discontinue their use of our therapeutic services. We believe these discontinuances relate primarily to their overall efforts to reduce the costs they bear for therapy-related services within their facilities. As a part of those terminations of service, in a number of cases, we elected to sell terminating clients the equipment that we had utilized for their locations, which resulted in our recognition of $4.1 million in equipment sales in 2018, as compared with $3.1 million in 2017 and $6.7 million in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, due to customer discontinuances, we experienced a decrease of $5.7 million in therapeutic services and supplies revenue, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in therapeutic equipment sales, for a total reduction of $4.7 million in revenues we received from therapeutic equipment and services. We recognized a total of $55.4 million in revenues from therapeutic equipment and services in 2018. In 2019, we anticipate a further decline of approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million in revenue from these services associated with customer discontinuances. Within this portion of our business, we have responded to these trends through increases in our marketing programs which convey the value we believe our services have to patients at SNFs and other adjacent health services provider markets.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nIn our Patient Care segment, we have a positive view of the long-term need for prosthetic and orthotic devices and services within the markets that we serve. To address the debilitating effects of injuries and medical conditions such as diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and congenital disorders, we believe patients will have a continuing need for the O&P services that we provide. As the population grows and ages, we also believe there will be a gradual underlying increase in market demand.\nTo ensure we maintain and grow our share of this market, we believe that it will be necessary for us to find effective means to automate and better organize our business processes, further improve our reimbursement capabilities and lower our cost structure in the longer term. Our size may afford us the ability to achieve economies of scale through purchasing and process automation initiatives that could be difficult for our smaller competitors. However, our size can work against us if we do not succeed in effectively serving our referring physicians and in competing with our individual competitors in each of the markets that we serve.\nSee the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment.\nAcquisition Activity\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired two O&P businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $3.1 million, including $2.0 million in net cash and $1.1 million of Seller Notes. We made no acquisitions in 2017 or 2016.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our business is affected by the degree to which patients have otherwise met the deductibles for which they are responsible in their medical plans during the course of the year. The first quarter is normally our lowest relative net revenue quarter, followed by the second and third quarters, which are somewhat higher and consistent with one another, and, due to the general fulfillment by patients of their health plan co-payments and deductible requirements towards the year's end, our fourth quarter is normally our highest revenue producing quarter.\nOur results are also affected, to a lesser extent, by our holding of an education fair in the first quarter of each year. This one-week event is conducted to assist our clinicians in maintaining their training and certification requirements and to facilitate a national meeting with our clinical leaders. We also invite manufacturers of the componentry for the devices we fabricate to these annual events so they can demonstrate their products and otherwise assist in our training process. During the first quarter of 2018, 2017, and 2016, we spent approximately $2.3 million, $2.0 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, on travel and other costs associated with this one-week event. In addition to the costs we incur associated with this annual event, we also lose the productivity of a significant portion of our clinicians during the one-week period in which this event occurs, which contributes to the lower seasonal revenue level we experience during the first quarter of each year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates, assumptions, and disclosures. We have chosen accounting policies within GAAP that management believes are appropriate to fairly present, in all material respects, our operating results and financial position. Our significant accounting policies are stated in Note A - \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our results of operations and the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffect of Adoption of ASC 606\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. As a practical expedient, we adopted a portfolio approach in evaluating our sources of revenue for implications of adoption. In accordance with the modified retrospective method, results of operations for the reporting periods after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605.\nWe recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 was as follows:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

Care segment as of December 31, 2018 and recognizing deferred revenue of $1.0 million from satisfying performance obligations from the previous period. Estimated uncollectible amounts due from self-pay patients for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $4.2 million and are considered implicit price concessions under ASC 606 and are recorded as a reduction to net revenue.\nPatient Care Segment\nRevenue in our Patient Care segment is primarily derived from contracts with third party payors for the provision of O&P devices and is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the patient at the time the patient receives the device. At, or subsequent to delivery, we issue an invoice to the third party payor, which primarily consists of commercial insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and private or patient pay (\u201cPrivate Pay\u201d) individuals. We recognize revenue for the amounts we expect to receive from payors based on expected contractual reimbursement rates, which are net of estimated contractual discounts and implicit price concessions. These revenue amounts are further revised as claims are adjudicated, which may result in additional disallowances. As such, these adjustments do not relate to an inability to pay, but to contractual allowances, our failure to ensure that a patient was currently eligible under a payor's health plan, that the plan provides full O&P benefits, that we received prior authorization, that we filed or appealed the payor's determination timely, on the basis of our coding, failure by certain classes of patients to pay their portion of a claim, or other administrative issues which are considered as part of the transaction price and recorded as a reduction of revenues.\nOur products and services are sold with a 90-day labor and 180-day warranty for fabricated components. Warranties are not considered a separate performance obligation. We estimate warranties based on historical trends and include them in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nA portion of our O&P revenue comes from the provision of cranial devices. In addition to delivering the cranial device, there are patient follow up visits where we assist in treating the patient's condition by adjusting or modifying the cranial device. We conclude that, for these devices, there are two performance obligations and use the expected cost plus margin approach to estimate for the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The allocated portion associated with the patient's receipt of the cranial device is recognized when the patient receives the device while the portion of revenue associated with the follow up visits is initially recorded as deferred revenue. On average, the cranial device follow up visits occur within 90 days after the patient receives the device and the deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over this period.\nMedicare and Medicaid regulations and the various agreements we have with other third party payors, including commercial healthcare payors under which these contractual adjustments and disallowed revenue are calculated, are complex and are subject to interpretation and adjustment and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services. Therefore, the particular O&P devices and related services authorized and provided, and the related reimbursement, are subject to interpretation and adjustment that could result in payments that differ from our estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and reimbursement schedules, and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management. As a result, there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change and any related adjustments will be recorded as adjustments to net revenue when they become known.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers in our Patient Care segment for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 260,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Insurance/Managed Care (excluding Medicare and Medicaid Managed Care)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 316,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Veterans Administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 857,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 851,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 840,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts & Services Segment\nThe adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our Product & Services segment.\nRevenue in our Products & Services segment is derived from the distribution of O&P components and the leasing and sale of rehabilitation equipment and ancillary consumable supplies combined with equipment maintenance, education, and training.\nDistribution services revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied, which occurs with the transfer of control of our products. This occurs either upon shipment or delivery of goods, depending on whether the terms are FOB Origin or FOB Destination. Payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products to a customer (\u201ctransaction price\u201d).\nTo the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as prompt payment discounts, list price discounts, rebates, and volume discounts, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available.\nWe reduce revenue by estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances. Provisions for product returns and other allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period sales are recognized. We make estimates of the amount of sales returns and allowances that will eventually be incurred. Management analyzes sales programs that are in effect, contractual arrangements, market acceptance, and historical trends when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowance accounts.\nTherapeutic program equipment and related services revenue are recognized over the applicable term the customer has the right to use the equipment and as the services are provided. Equipment sales revenue is recognized upon delivery, with any related services revenue deferred and recognized as the services are performed. Sales of consumables are recognized upon delivery.\nIn addition, we estimate amounts recorded to bad debt expense using historical trends and these are presented as a bad debt expense under the operating expense section of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers in our Product & Services segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution services, net of intersegment revenue eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutic solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 188,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nPatient Care Segment\nWe establish allowances for accounts receivable to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. The Patient Care segment's accounts receivables are recorded net of unapplied cash, estimated allowances for implicit price concessions such as disallowed revenue and patient non-payments, as described in the revenue recognition accounting policy above.\nBoth the allowance for disallowed revenue and the allowance for patient non-payments consider historical collection experience by each of the Medicare and non-Medicare (commercial insurance, Medicaid, U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs and Private Pay) primary payor class groupings. For each payor class grouping, liquidation analysis of historical period end receivable balances are performed to ascertain collections experience by aging category. We believe the use of historical collection experience applied to current period end receivable balances is reasonable. In the absence of an evident adverse trend, we use historical experience rates calculated using an average of four quarters of data with at least twelve months of adjudication. We believe the time periods analyzed provide sufficient time for most balances to adjudicate in the normal course of operations. We will modify the time periods analyzed when significant trends indicate that adjustments should be made. In addition, estimates are adjusted when appropriate for information available up through the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.\nProducts & Services Segment\nProducts & Services segment's allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the analysis of the segment's historical write-offs experience, accounts receivable aging and economic status of its customers. Accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible are written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of an allowance for estimated sales returns.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of estimated cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) basis. Provisions have also been made to reduce the carrying value of inventories for excess, obsolete, or otherwise impaired inventory on hand at period-end.\nPatient Care Segment\nSubstantially all of our Patient Care segment inventories are recorded through a periodic approach whereby inventory quantities are adjusted on the basis of a quarterly physical count. Segment inventories relate primarily to raw materials and WIP at Hanger Clinics. Inventories at Hanger Clinics totaled $27.5 million and $27.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with WIP inventory representing $9.3 million and $9.0 million of the total inventory, respectively.\nRaw materials consist of purchased parts, components, and supplies which are used in the assembly of O&P devices for delivery to patients. In some cases, purchased parts and components are also sold directly to patients. Raw materials are valued based on recent vendor invoices, reduced by estimated vendor rebates. Such rebates are recognized as a reduction of cost of materials in the consolidated statements of operations when the related devices or components are delivered to the patient. Approximately 74% and 71% of raw materials at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively were purchased from our Products & Services segment. Raw material inventory was $18.2 million and $18.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWIP consists of devices which are in the process of assembly at our clinics or fabrication centers. WIP quantities were determined by the physical count of patient orders at the end of every quarter of 2018 and 2017 while the related stage of completion of each order was established by clinic personnel. We do not have an inventory costing system and as a result, the identified WIP quantities were valued on the basis of estimated raw materials, labor, and overhead costs. To estimate such costs, we develop bills of materials for certain categories of devices that we assemble and deliver to patients. Within each bill of material, we estimate (i) the typical types of component parts necessary to assemble each device; (ii) the points in the assembly process when such component parts are added; (iii) the estimated cost of such parts based on historical purchasing data; (iv) the estimated labor costs incurred at each stage of assembly; and (v) the estimated overhead costs applicable to the device.\nProducts & Services Segment\nProduct & Service segment inventories consist primarily of finished goods at its distribution centers as well as raw materials at fabrication facilities, and totaled $40.2 million and $41.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Finished goods include products that are available for sale to third party customers as well as to our Patient Care segment as described above. Such inventories were determined on the basis of perpetual records and a physical count at year end. Inventories in connection with therapeutic services are valued at a weighted average cost.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. For consideration of the net assets acquired, we typically pay cash and issue a Seller Note. We may also include contingent consideration with payment terms associated with the achievement of designated collection targets of the acquired business. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition inclusive of identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities are based on detailed valuations performed internally or by external valuation specialists that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. Significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly acquired intangible assets, including estimated useful lives. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and discounted cash flows from the acquired business. Each asset acquired or liability assumed is measured at estimated fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Subsequent changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration are recognized as \u201cGeneral and administrative expenses\u201d within the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from purchased businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors for a reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to bypass this qualitative assessment or alternatively determine that a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required, our annual goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (including attributed goodwill). We measure the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of income and market approaches. Any impairment would be recognized by a charge to income from operations and a reduction in the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe apply judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the implied fair value of goodwill which is dependent on significant assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows, terminal value, changes in working capital requirements, and discount rates.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded impairments of our goodwill totaling $0.2 million, $54.7 million and $86.2 million, respectively. See Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these charges.\nAs described, we apply judgment in the selection of key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test and as part of our evaluation of intangible assets tested annually and at interim testing dates as necessary. If these assumptions differ from actual, we could incur additional impairment charges and those charges could be material.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for net operating loss and other credit carry forwards and the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, and future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\nWe provide a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have experienced losses from 2014 to 2017 due to impairments of our intangible assets, increased professional fees in relation to our restatement and related remediation procedures for identified material weaknesses, and increased interest and bank fees. These losses have necessitated that we evaluate the sufficiency of our valuation allowance. We are in a taxable income position in 2018 and are able to utilize net operating loss. We have $10.7 million and $24.2 million of U.S. federal and $166.0 million and $195.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These carryforwards will be used to offset future income but may be limited by the change in ownership rules in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts between 2018 and 2038. We have $65.6 million of net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018. We expect to generate income before taxes in future periods at a level that would allow for the full realization of the majority of our net deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $8.9 million as of December 31, 2018, against net deferred tax assets, primarily related to various state jurisdictions.\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in expected future pre-tax earnings, tax law, interactions with taxing authorities, and developments in case law. Our material assumptions are our forecasts of future pre-tax earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and income represented by the deferred tax assets and liabilities, all of which involve the exercise of significant judgment.\nAlthough we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate determination of the appropriate amount of valuation allowance involves significant judgment. If expected future taxable income is not achieved a larger valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be required and could be significant, which could materially increase our expenses in the period the allowance is recognized and materially adversely affect our results of operations and statement of financial condition.\nWe believe that our tax positions are consistent with applicable tax law, but certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities. In these cases, we record the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. We record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. If not paid, the liability for uncertain tax positions is reversed as a reduction of income tax expense at the earlier of the period when the position is effectively settled or when the statute of limitations has expired. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Interest and penalties, when applicable, are recorded within the income tax provision.\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. Based on a reduced U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21% from the Tax Act, we re-measured deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future in 2017. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, in 2017, we recognized a provisional amount, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, of approximately $35 million of tax expense related to re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was recorded as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized the provisional amounts for all the enactment-dates income tax effects of the Tax Act, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to the \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section in Note A - \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements that are either expected to have more than a minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operation, or that we are still assessing to determine their impact.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated results of operations were as follows:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 v 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,048,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 364,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional accounting and legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (99.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 989,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,059,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-service defined benefit plan expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 99.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 99.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) NM - Not Meaningful\nMaterial costs, personnel costs, and other operating costs reflect expenses we incur in connection with our delivery of care through our clinics and other patient care operations, or through the distribution of products and services, and exclude general and administrative activities. General and administrative activities reflect expenses we incur that are not directly related to the operation of our clinics or provision of products and services.\nDue to the substantial amount we have incurred for professional accounting and legal services, we separately disclose these expenses within operating expenses. We have incurred these increases primarily in connection with the Restatement, the Investigation, and in connection with our accounting and remediation activities associated with the material weaknesses.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, our operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 34.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional accounting and legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 101.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the significance of disallowed revenue as discussed above in \u201cReimbursement Trends\u201d, the rate of disallowed revenue experienced during the periods encompassed by this Annual Report on Form 10-K and to assist in evaluating the comparability of expense trends, the following table provides our adjusted gross revenue, disallowed revenue, and net revenue for each year as well as our expenses as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,048,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payor disallowances and patient non-payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted gross revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,091,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,077,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 33.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional accounting and legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 98.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayor disallowances and patient non-payments in the above table for 2018 includes $4.2 million in patient non-payment amounts which have been treated as a reduction in our revenues commencing in 2018 in connection with our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, as discussed above in \u201cReimbursement Trends.\u201d The amount shown for 2017, includes only payor disallowance amounts.\nDuring the previous two years, the number of patient care clinics and satellite locations we operated or leased have been as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient care clinics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient care clinics reflect locations that are licensed as a primary location to provide O&P services and which are fully staffed and open throughout a typical operating week. To facilitate patient convenience, we also operate satellite clinics. These are remote locations associated with a primary care clinic, utilized to see patients and are open for operation on less than a full-time basis during a typical operating week.\nNet revenue. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,048.8 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 0.8%, from $1,040.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenue by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, was as follows:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 857,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 851,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 188,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,048,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $857.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 0.6%, from $852.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Same clinic revenue increased $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in same clinic revenue per day of 0.9%. This growth was offset by the effect of clinic closures which reflected decreased revenue of $1.6 million as compared with the same period in the prior year. Net revenue was also negatively impacted as compared to the same period in the prior year by $4.0 million from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018.\nRevenue growth during the year was primarily the result of growth in services to prosthetic patients. During the year, our revenue from prosthetics increased by 3.3% and constituted 54% of Patient Care's revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 53% for the same period in the prior year. We believe an increased focus on the demonstration of patient outcomes and related marketing initiatives contributed to this growth in prosthetic revenue.\nProducts & Services net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $191.4 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.4% from $188.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase was comprised of $7.3 million from the distribution of O&P componentry to independent providers partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in net revenue from therapeutic services, which related primarily to client cancellations and price concessions.\nMaterial costs. Material costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $338.0 million, an increase of $8.8 million or 2.7%, from $329.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Total material costs as a percentage of net revenue increased to 32.2% in 2018 from 31.6% in 2017 due primarily to changes in our Patient Care segment product mix to higher-cost prosthetic devices. Material costs by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, were as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 251,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 338,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care material costs increased $6.3 million, or 2.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the $4.0 million effect on net revenue resulting from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, Patient Care material costs as a percent of revenue increased slightly to 30.0% in 2018 from 29.6% in 2017, primarily due to increases in the mix of our business towards higher-cost prosthetic devices.\nProducts & Services material costs increased $2.5 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. As a percent of revenue, material costs grew to 41.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018 from 41.0% in the same period 2017.\nPersonnel costs. Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $364.1 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 0.8%, from $361.1 million for the same period in the prior year.

Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $123.9 million, a decrease of $5.9 million, or 4.6%, from $129.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Bad debt expense decreased $10.2 million, primarily from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard under which certain of these expenses were re-characterized as implicit price concessions within our Patient Care segment and are now reflected as an adjustment to net revenue. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in professional fees, a $1.4 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in other operating costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $109.5 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.2%, from $109.3 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase included $2.0 million in other expenses, $1.6 million of professional expense relating primarily to growth and other corporate initiatives, and $0.8 million in advertising expense. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million favorable settlement of our long standing claim relating to the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d disaster and $0.5 million from our favorable resolution of outstanding abandoned and unclaimed property claims with the State of Delaware, and $2.0 million in personnel related costs.\nProfessional accounting and legal fees. Professional accounting and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $16.9 million, a decrease of $19.3 million from $36.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Advisory and other fees decreased $17.2 million, audit related fees decreased by $2.0 million, and legal fees decreased by $0.1 million.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $36.5 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 7.1%, from $39.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Fully amortized intangible assets decreased amortization $2.7 million.\nImpairment of intangible assets. As more fully explained in Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the continued decline in our Therapeutic reporting unit forecasted outlook, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name. See the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.6 million, a decrease of $20.1 million, or 34.9%, from $57.7 million for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings arising from our debt refinancing in March 2018 and secondarily reflected a $1.5 million decrease related to our settlement of outstanding abandoned and unclaimed property claims with the State of Delaware in a manner that did not require us to pay a portion of the estimated interest we had accrued on long standing unpaid claim amounts.\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.2 million, or 119.6% of income from continuing operations before taxes, compared to a provision of $27.3 million, or (35.3)% of income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate in 2018 consists principally of the 21% federal statutory tax rate and the rate impact from state income taxes and permanent tax differences. The federal statutory tax rate in 2017 was 35%. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the pre-tax book income loss in the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferred tax impact related to the change in the Tax Act, whereas we had pre-tax book income in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet loss. Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.9 million as compared to a net loss of $104.7 million for year ended December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated results of operations were as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nChange (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 v 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,042,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 332,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 363,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional accounting and legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,059,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,113,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (71,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 73.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-service defined benefit plan expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (123,316\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,910\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (107,406\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (106,471\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) NM - Not Meaningful\nMaterial costs, personnel costs, and other operating costs reflect expenses we incur in connection with our delivery of care through our clinics and other patient care operations, or through the distribution of products and services, and exclude general and administrative activities.

During 2017, same clinic revenue increased $3.0 million, or 0.8%, per day, excluding the favorable effects of improvements in our rates of disallowance. Disallowed Patient Care revenue decreased by $12.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to initiatives and actions taken in 2015 and 2016 to address previous increases in disallowed revenue trends. Including the favorable effect of improvements in the rate of disallowances, same clinic revenue grew by $15.0 million, or 2.2%, per day. During the year, our revenue from prosthetics increased by 2.9% and constituted approximately 53% of our total Patient Care revenue as compared with approximately 52% in the prior year. In addition to underlying growth in prosthetic revenue, this change in mix was in part due to a reduction in revenue from certain off-the-shelf orthotics and diabetic shoes. Growth in same clinic revenue was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in revenue associated with clinic closures. During the year, we had a net reduction of 27 clinic locations due primarily to their marginal performance and profitability.\nProducts & Services net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $188.8 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 6.5%, from $201.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Within the Products & Services segment, due primarily to customer cancellations (as discussed in \u201cProducts and Services Segment Trends\u201d above), revenue from therapeutic services declined $11.0 million and sales of therapeutic equipment declined $3.6 million. These adverse trends were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in other Products & Services net revenue, primarily related to our distribution of orthotic and prosthetic componentry to independent providers.\nMaterial costs. Material costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $329.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 0.9%, from $332.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due primarily to favorable changes in our Patient Care segment product mix, total material costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly from 31.9% in 2016 to 31.6% in 2017.

This underlying reduction in cost of materials related primarily to favorable changes in our underlying mix of orthotic and prosthetic devices during the year. In particular, reductions in revenue relating to certain off-the-shelf orthotics and diabetic shoes, which carry higher relative costs of materials than custom orthotic and prosthetic devices, contributed to reductions in Patient Care material costs as a percentage of net revenue. Additionally, we also benefited from an average aggregate reduction in the cost of components utilized in the fabrication of devices.\nFavorable reductions in the cost of materials for Patient Care were partially offset by increases in the relative cost of components distributed through our Products & Services segment. In this segment, material costs increased $1.3 million for 2017 compared to 2016, and reflected an underlying increase on a percent of net revenue basis, growing from 37.7% in 2016 to 41.0% in 2017, inclusive of the benefit of intersegment cost allocations to the Patient Care segment. These increases in materials costs arose primarily due to the loss of certain of our larger, higher margin, independent O&P provider accounts which were offset by growth in sales to other customers with lower margins.\nPersonnel costs. Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $361.1 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 0.7%, from $363.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Bad debt expense decreased $4.3 million due to improvements in our collection efforts, rent and related office and occupancy costs decreased $3.7 million from the closure and restructuring of clinics, telephone and data transmission costs decreased $2.1 million, and other expenses decreased $0.8 million. These decreases were partially offset by $1.7 million increase in professional fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $109.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 2.7%, from $106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Incentive compensation expense increased $3.6 million, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes. The increase in incentive compensation was due in part to a discretionary employee bonus and 401(k) match awarded based on our performance during the year. Other office and related expenses increased $0.9 million.\nProfessional accounting and legal fees. Professional accounting and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 12.1%, from $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Legal fees decreased $8.6 million due to costs associated with the prior Investigation and Restatement, advisory, and other fees decreased $0.1 million, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in audit related fees.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.3 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 12.5%, from $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease included $4.1 million lower amortization due to fully amortized customer list intangibles for prior acquisitions, $1.2 million lower depreciation of program equipment either sold or fully depreciated, $0.4 million lower amortization of trade names, non-compete agreements and asset retirement obligations, and $0.2 million lower depreciation of software. These decreases were partially offset by $0.3 million increase in depreciation of leasehold improvements.\nImpairment of intangible assets. As more fully explained in Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the continued decline in our Therapeutic and Distribution reporting units forecasted outlook, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment. In 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $53.3 million, of which $32.8 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit and $20.5 million related to our Distribution reporting unit, and other intangible asset impairment of $1.4 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name. In 2016, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $86.0 million, of which $64.9 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit and $21.1 million related to our Distribution reporting unit. In addition, we recorded other intangible asset impairment of $0.2 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $57.7 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or 27.6%, from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $10.7 million higher interest expense associated with our debt refinancing in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.8 million related to increased interest rates and revolver activity, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.0 million related primarily to reductions in Seller Notes, escheat liabilities and lease obligations.\nExtinguishment of debt. In August 2016, we entered into a new Term B Credit Agreement, dated March 6, 2018 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), providing for a new $280.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility. We used approximately $205.3 million of the proceeds from the Term B Credit Agreement to redeem our $200 million in senior notes (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d) which were scheduled to mature in November 2018. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.0 million for year ended December 31, 2016. We incurred no similar expense in 2017.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes. An income tax provision of $27.3 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a benefit of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the Federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act which decreased tax-effected net deferred tax asset balances by $35.0 million and therefore increased deferred tax expense significantly. The decrease in losses from continuing operations before income taxes also contributed to the increase in tax expense. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was (35.3)% and 12.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax rate change impact on the deferred balance and other non-deductible expenses.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.9 million which related to contingent consideration received in 2016 from the disposal of Dosteon in 2015.\nNet loss. Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2017 was $104.7 million as compared to a net loss of $106.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nTo provide cash for our operations and capital expenditures, our immediate source of liquidity is our cash and investment balances and any amounts we have available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We refer to the sum of these two amounts as our \u201cliquidity.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of $189.2 million, which reflected an increase of $101.3 million, from the $87.9 million in liquidity we had as of December 31, 2017. Our liquidity at December 31, 2018 was comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $95.1 million and $94.1 million in available borrowing capacity under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility. This increase in liquidity relates primarily to the net proceeds of $49.7 million from the refinancing of our indebtedness on March 6, 2018.\nIf we are not compliant with our debt covenants in any period, absent a waiver or amendment of our Credit Agreement, we may be unable to access funds in our revolving credit facility.\nWorking Capital and Days Sales Outstanding\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital of $154.6 million compared to working capital of $78.7 million as of December 31, 2017. Our working capital increased $75.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in current assets of $74.9 million and a decrease in current liabilities of $1.0 million.\nOur current liabilities decreased primarily due to decreases in accrued professional fees, accrued franchise tax, and other accrued expenses of $10.0 million and patient deposits of $5.6 million. These are offset by increases in accounts payable of $7.5 million, the current portion of long term debt of $4.2 million, accrued compensation related costs of $1.7 million, and interest rate swap of $0.7 million.\nOur current assets increased primarily due to a $93.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents offset by decreases of $12.7 million in income tax receivables, $2.4 million in net accounts receivable, and $1.4 million in inventories. Cash received for income tax refunds, net of income tax payments, was $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved rates of collection and increases in our coordination of collection efforts on accounts receivable through use of our revenue cycle management group.\nDays sales outstanding (\u201cDSO\u201d) is a calculation that approximates the average number of days between the billing for our services and the date of our receipt of payment, which we estimate using a 90 day rolling period of net revenue. This computation can provide a relative measure of the effectiveness of our billing and collections activities. As of December 31, 2018, our DSO was 46 days, which is unchanged from December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nSources and Uses of Cash in the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017\nCash flows from operating activities increased $48.4 million to an inflow of $78.5 million for year ended December 31, 2018 from a use of $30.1 million for year ended December 31, 2017. This was due primarily to the changes in working capital in 2018 compared to 2017 which were discussed above.\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $26.3 million to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in investing activities included a $3.8 million increase in purchases of therapeutic program equipment, a $2.6 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment, and a $2.0 million increase in acquisitions net of cash acquired. This was also impacted by the $17.1 million decrease in proceeds from company-owned life insurance investment and a $0.7 million decrease in proceeds of sale of property, plant and equipment.\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased $72.8 million to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from cash flows used in financing activities of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase included $83.9 million related to our refinancing of indebtedness and $2.6 million reduction in payments on Seller Notes and other contingent consideration, partially offset by $12.3 million of debt issuance costs, extinguishment costs, and fees and $1.4 million in employee stock based compensation and capital lease obligations.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring 2018 we expended a combined total of $28.8 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and the purchase of therapeutic program equipment. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to our investment in leasehold and other machinery and equipment for our patient care clinics, for equipment we use in providing therapeutic solutions, as well as for the purchase or development of information technology assets that support our businesses and corporate activities. In 2019, we currently estimate that we will spend approximately $35.0 million for these types of capital expenditures. This planned increase primarily relates to growth in our leasehold and other expenditures for our patient care business, as well as for the replacement of certain portions of our information technology infrastructure.\nEffect of Indebtedness\nDue to the then pending June 17, 2018, maturity of our previous credit agreement, on March 6, 2018 we entered into a new Credit Agreement in order to refinance our indebtedness. This refinancing of our indebtedness are disclosed in Note M - \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Our new indebtedness bears reduced rates of interest compared with those under our prior indebtedness, and as such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported interest expense of $37.6 million compared with the $57.7 million we reported in 2017. Cash paid for interest totaled $31.3 million, $48.4 million, and $42.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively.\nScheduled maturities of debt as of December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 483,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 520,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 510,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Outlook and Going Concern Evaluation\nOur Credit Agreement has a term loan facility with $501.2 million in principal outstanding at December 31, 2018, due in quarterly principal installments equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of $505 million, commencing June 29, 2018, with all remaining outstanding principal due at maturity in March 2025 and a revolving credit facility with no\nborrowings and a maximum aggregate amount of availability of $100 million at June 30, 2018 that matures in March 2023. We currently believe that our anticipated operating trends, when coupled with anticipated decreases in our payments of interest expense and professional fees, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations during the coming twelve months.\nASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern requires that we evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to meet our financial obligations when they become due during the twelve month period from the date our financial statements are available to be issued. We have performed such an evaluation and, based on the results of that assessment, we are not aware of any relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that may or could have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 for each of the indicated periods:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 483,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 520,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 532,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 863,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nIt is our policy to not pay cash dividends on our common stock, and, given our capital needs, we currently do not foresee a change in this policy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K including this \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (or \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis\u201d) contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our liquidity and our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies. These statements often include words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d or similar words. These statements are based on certain assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative, that may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports.\nThese statements involve risks, estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements and elsewhere in this report, and any claims, investigations, or proceedings arising as a result, as well as our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d contained elsewhere in this report; any regulatory review of, or litigation relating to, our accounting practices, financial statements, and other financial data, periodic reports, or other corporate actions; changes in the demand for our orthotic and prosthetic (\u201cO&P\u201d) products and services, uncertainties relating to the results of operations or our acquired O&P patient care clinics, our ability to enter into and derive benefits from managed-care contracts, our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified O&P clinicians, federal laws governing the health care industry, uncertainties inherent in investigations and legal proceedings, governmental policies affecting O&P operations, and other risks and uncertainties generally affecting the health care industry.\nReaders are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those described in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, some of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those contemplated by any forward-looking statement. In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements in this discussion to reflect events and circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect unanticipated events. Forward-looking statements and our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected by the risks set forth in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or by other unknown risks and uncertainties.\nEffect of Delay in Financial Filings\nBeginning with Q3 of 2014 through Q1 of 2018, we were delayed in the preparation and filing of our financial statements. In connection with our efforts to restate our prior financial statements, remediate our material weaknesses, regain our timely filing status, and undertake related activities, we have incurred third party professional fees in excess of the amounts we estimate that we would have otherwise incurred. The estimated professional fees associated with these efforts are as follows:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Balance to be Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expensed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> in Future Periods\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,917\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 10,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 3,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we expended a total of $12.5 million in excess professional fees for the primary purpose of remediating our continuing material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Due to the ongoing material weaknesses in our controls over financial reporting, we currently undertake additional substantive procedures to test and verify financial statement amounts in connection with the preparation of our financial statements. We currently estimate that we will incur an additional $5.1 million of such excess fees during 2019. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe refer to certain financial measures and statistics that are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We utilize these non-GAAP measures in order to evaluate the underlying factors that affect our business performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have defined and provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis are as follows:\nAdjusted Gross Revenue and Disallowed Revenue - \u201cAdjusted gross revenue\u201d reflects our gross billings after their adjustment to reflect estimated discounts established in our contracts with payors of health care claims. Pursuant to our contracts with payors, a portion of our adjusted gross billings may be disallowed based on factors including physician documentation, patient eligibility, plan design, prior authorization, timeliness of filings or appeal, coding selection, failure by certain patients to pay their portion of claims, computational errors associated with sequestration, and other factors. We refer to these and other amounts as being \u201cdisallowed revenue\u201d or \u201cpayor disallowances.\u201d Our net revenue reflects adjusted gross revenue after reduction for the estimated aggregate amount of disallowed revenue for the applicable period. To facilitate analysis of the comparability of our results, we provide these non-GAAP measures due to the significant changes that we have experienced in recent years in disallowed revenue which are further discussed below.\nSame Clinic Revenues Per Day - measures the year-over-year change in revenue from clinics that have been open a full calendar year or more; examples of clinics not included in the same clinic population are closures and acquisitions. Day-adjusted growth normalizes sales for the number of days a clinic was open in each comparable period.\nOverview\nBusiness Overview\nGeneral\nWe are a leading national provider of products and services that assist in enhancing or restoring the physical capabilities of patients with disabilities or injuries. Built on the legacy of James Edward Hanger, the first amputee of the American Civil War, we and our predecessor companies have provided O&P services for over 150 years. We provide O&P services, distribute O&P devices and components, manage O&P networks, and provide therapeutic solutions to patients and businesses in acute, post-acute, and clinic settings. We operate through two segments - Patient Care and Products & Services.\nOur Patient Care segment is primarily comprised of Hanger Clinic, which specializes in the design, fabrication, and delivery of custom O&P devices through 676 patient care clinics and 104 satellite locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018. We also provide payor network contracting services to other O&P providers through this segment.\nOur Products & Services segment is comprised of our distribution services and our therapeutic solutions businesses. As a leading provider of O&P products in the United States, we coordinate, through our distribution services business, the procurement and distribution of a broad catalog of O&P parts, componentry, and devices to independent O&P providers nationwide. To facilitate speed and convenience, we deliver these products through our five distribution facilities that are located in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The other business in our Products & Services segment is our therapeutic solutions business, which develops specialized rehabilitation technologies and provides evidence-based clinical programs for post-acute rehabilitation to patients at approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our net revenues were $1,048.8 million, $1,040.8 million, and $1,042.1 million, respectively. We recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million, $104.7 million, and $107.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIndustry Overview\nWe estimate that approximately $4.2 billion is spent in the United States each year for orthotic and prosthetic products and services. We estimate that our Patient Care segment currently accounts for approximately 20% of market share, providing a comprehensive portfolio of orthotic, prosthetic, and post-operative solutions to patients in acute, post-acute, and patient care clinic settings.\nThe traditional O&P patient care industry is highly fragmented and is characterized by local, independent O&P businesses. We do not believe that any single competitor accounts for more than 2% of the country's total estimated O&P patient care clinic revenues.\nThe industry is characterized by stable, recurring revenues, primarily resulting from new patients as well as the need for periodic replacement and modification of O&P devices. We anticipate that the demand for O&P services will continue to grow as the nation's population increases, and as a result of several trends, including the aging of the U.S. population, there will be an increase in the prevalence of disease-related disability and the demand for new and advanced devices. We believe the typical replacement time for prosthetic devices is three to five years, while the typical replacement time for orthotic devices varies, depending on the device.\nWe estimate that approximately $1.7 billion is spent in the United States each year by providers of O&P patient care services for the O&P products, components, devices, and supplies used in their businesses. Our Products & Services segment distributes to independent providers of O&P services and to our own patient care clinics. We estimate that our distribution sales account for approximately 8% of the market for O&P products, components, devices, and supplies (excluding sales to our Patient Care segment).\nWe estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, integrated clinical programs, and clinician training in skilled nursing facilities (\u201cSNFs\u201d) to be approximately $150 million annually. We currently provide these products and services to approximately 24% of the estimated 15,000 SNFs located in the U.S. We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, clinical programs, and training within the broader post-acute rehabilitation markets to be approximately $400 million annually. We do not currently provide a meaningful amount of products and services to this broader market.\nBusiness Description\nPatient Care\nOur Patient Care segment employs approximately 1,500 clinical prosthetists, orthotists, and pedorthists, which we refer to as clinicians, substantially all of which are certified by either the American Board for Certification (\u201cABC\u201d) or the Board of Certification of Orthotists and Prosthetists, which are the two boards that certify O&P clinicians. To facilitate timely service to our patients, we also employ technicians, fitters, and other ancillary providers to assist its clinicians in the performance of their duties. Through this segment, we additionally provide network contracting services to independent providers of O&P through our \u201cLinkia\u201d business.\nPatients are typically referred to Hanger Clinic by an attending physician who determines a patient's treatment and writes a prescription. Our clinicians then consult with both the referring physician and the patient with a view toward assisting in the design of an orthotic or prosthetic device to meet the patient's needs. O&P devices are increasingly technologically advanced and custom designed to add functionality and comfort to patients' lives, shorten the rehabilitation process, and lower the cost of rehabilitation.\nBased on the prescription written by a referring physician, our clinicians examine and evaluate the patient and either design a custom device or, in the case of certain orthotic needs, utilize a non-custom device, including, in appropriate circumstances, an \u201coff the shelf\u201d device, to address the patient's needs. When fabricating a device, our clinicians ascertain the specific requirements, componentry, and measurements necessary for the construction of the device. Custom devices are constructed using componentry provided by a variety of third party manufacturers who specialize in O&P, coupled with sockets and other elements that are fabricated by our clinicians and technicians, to meet the individual patient's physical and ambulatory needs. Our clinicians and technicians typically utilize castings, electronic scans, and other techniques to fabricate items that are specialized for the patient. After fabricating the device, a fitting process is undertaken and adjustments are made to ensure the achievement of proper alignment, fit, and patient comfort. The fitting process often involves several stages to successfully achieve desired functional and cosmetic results.\nGiven the differing physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prosthesis and orthosis is customized for each particular patient. These custom devices are commonly fabricated at one of our regional or national fabrication facilities.\nWe have earned a reputation within the O&P industry for the development and use of innovative technology in our products, which has increased patient comfort and capability and can significantly enhance the rehabilitation process. Frequently, our proprietary Insignia scanning system is used in the fabrication process. The Insignia system scans the patient and produces an accurate computer-generated image, resulting in a faster turnaround for the patient's device and a more professional overall experience.\nIn recent years, we have established a centralized revenue cycle management organization that assists our clinics in pre-authorization, patient eligibility, denial management, collections, payor audit coordination, and other accounts receivable processes.\nThe principal reimbursement sources for our services are:\n\u00b7 Commercial private payors and other non-governmental organizations, which consist of individuals, rehabilitation providers, commercial insurance companies, health management organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d), preferred provider organizations (\u201cPPOs\u201d), hospitals, vocational rehabilitation centers, workers' compensation programs, third party administrators, and similar sources;\n\u00b7 Medicare, a federally funded health insurance program providing health insurance coverage for persons aged 65 or older and certain disabled persons;\n\u00b7 Medicaid, a health insurance program jointly funded by federal and state governments providing health insurance coverage for certain persons based upon financial need, regardless of age, which may supplement Medicare benefits for financially needy persons aged 65 or older; and\n\u00b7 the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nWe typically enter into contracts with third party payors that allow us to perform O&P services for a referred patient and to be paid under the contract with the third party payor. These contracts usually have a stated term of one to three years. These contracts generally may be terminated without cause by either party on 60 to 90 days' notice or on 30 days' notice if we have not complied with certain licensing, certification, program standards, Medicare or Medicaid requirements, or other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement for services is typically based on a fee schedule negotiated with the third party payor that reflects various factors, including market conditions, geographic area, and number of persons covered. Many of our commercial contracts are indexed to the commensurate Medicare fee schedule that relates to the products or services being provided.\nGovernment reimbursement is comprised of Medicare, Medicaid, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d.) These payors set maximum reimbursement levels for O&P services and products. Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (\u201cCPI-U\u201d) unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment. The CPI-U is adjusted further by an efficiency factor (the \u201cProductivity Adjustment\u201d) in order to determine the final rate adjustment each year. There can be no assurance that future adjustments will not reduce reimbursements for O&P services and products from these sources.\nWe, and the O&P industry in general, are subject to various Medicare compliance audits, including Recovery Audit Contractor (\u201cRAC\u201d) audits, Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (\u201cCERT\u201d) audits, Targeted Probe and Educate (\u201cTPE\u201d) audits, and Zone Program Integrity Contractor (\u201cZPIC\u201d) audits. TPE audits are generally pre-payment audits, while RAC, CERT, and ZPIC audits are generally post-payment audits. TPE audits replaced the previous Medicare Administrative Contractor audits. Adverse post-payment audit determinations generally require Hanger to reimburse Medicare for payments previously made, while adverse pre-payment audit determinations generally result in the denial of payment. In either case, we can request a redetermination or appeal, if we believe the adverse determination is unwarranted, which can take an extensive period of time to resolve, currently up to six years or more.\nProducts & Services\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Prosthetic Supply, Inc. (\u201cSPS\u201d), we distribute O&P components to independent providers of O&P and other customers. This componentry is provided by our supply chain operations, through which we procure, warehouse, and distribute over 400,000 SKUs from more than 300 different manufacturers. Our warehousing and distribution facilities in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas, are able to deliver products to the majority of our customers in the United States within two business days. Through its SureFit subsidiary, SPS also manufactures and sells therapeutic footwear for diabetic patients in the podiatric market.\nOur supply chain operations are an internal support organization that serves both SPS and our Patient Care clinics by procuring, warehousing, and distributing componentry. This organization enables us to:\n\u00b7 centralize our purchasing and thus lower our material costs by negotiating purchasing discounts from manufacturers;\n\u00b7 better manage our patient care clinic inventory levels and improve inventory turns;\n\u00b7 improve inventory quality control;\n\u00b7 encourage our patient care clinics to use the most clinically appropriate products; and\n\u00b7 coordinate new product development efforts with key vendors.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accelerated Care Plus Corp., our therapeutic solutions business is a leading provider of rehabilitation technologies and integrated clinical programs to post-acute care and rehabilitation providers. Our unique value proposition is to provide our customers with a full-service \u201ctotal solutions\u201d approach encompassing proven medical technology, evidence based clinical programs, and ongoing clinician education and training. Our services support increasingly advanced treatment options for a broader patient population and more medically complex conditions. We serve approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.\nReimbursement Trends\nIn our Patient Care segment, we are reimbursed primarily through employer-based plans offered by commercial insurance carriers, Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA. The following is a summary of our payor mix, expressed as an approximate percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 14.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Insurance/Managed Care (excluding Medicare and Medicaid Managed Care)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Veterans Administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care constitutes 81.8%, 81.9%, and 80.6% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively. Our remaining net revenue is from our Products & Services segment which derives its net revenue from commercial transactions with independent O&P providers, healthcare facilities, and other customers. In contrast to net revenues from our Patient Care segment, payment for these products and services are not directly subject to third party reimbursement from health care payors.\nThe amount of our reimbursement varies based on the nature of the O&P device we fabricate for our patients. Given the particular physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prostheses and orthoses is customized for each particular patient. The nature of this customization and the manner by which our claims submissions are reviewed by payors makes our reimbursement process administratively difficult.\nTo receive reimbursement for our work, we must ensure that our clinical, administrative, and billing personnel receive and verify certain medical and health plan information, record detailed documentation regarding the services we provide, and accurately and timely perform a number of claims submission and related administrative tasks. Traditionally, we have performed these tasks in a manual fashion and on a decentralized basis. In recent years, due to increases in payor pre-authorization processes, documentation requirements, pre-payment reviews, and pre- and post-payment audits, our ability to successfully undertake these tasks using our traditional approach has become increasingly challenging. We believe these changes in industry trends have been brought about in part by increased nationwide efforts to reduce health care costs.\nA measure of our effectiveness in securing reimbursement for our services can be found in the degree to which payors ultimately disallow payment of our claims. Payors can deny claims due to their determination that a physician who referred a patient to us did not sufficiently document that a device was medically necessary or clearly establish the ambulatory (or \u201cactivity\u201d) level of a patient. Claims can also be denied based on our failure to ensure that a patient was currently eligible under a payor's health plan, that the plan provides full O&P benefits, that we received prior authorization, that we filed or appealed the payor's determination timely, on the basis of our coding, failure by certain classes of patients to pay their portion of a claim, and for various other reasons. If any portion of, or administrative factor within, our claim is found by the payor to be lacking, then the entirety of the claim amount may be denied reimbursement. Due to the increasing demands of these processes, the level and capability of our staffing, as well as our material weaknesses and other considerations, our consolidated disallowed revenue and its relationship to consolidated adjusted gross revenue increased over historical levels to a peak level in 2014.\nCommencing in late 2014 and continuing through today, we have taken a number of actions to halt and reverse these disallowed revenue trends. These initiatives included: (i) the retention of consultants and creation of a central revenue cycle management function; (ii) addressing the issues identified in our patient management and electronic health record system; and (iii) the establishment of new clinic-level procedures and training regarding the collection of supporting documentation and the importance of diligence in our claims submission processes. While we continue to work towards further improvements in our procedures through the use of technology within our clinic and revenue cycle functions, we do not currently foresee that future reductions in disallowed revenue will be achievable or substantial as the improvements realized from 2014 through 2017. We saw disallowed rates in 2018 slightly above 2017 levels.\nUnder both ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), and the previous revenue recognition guidance ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (\u201cASC 605\u201d), disallowed revenue is considered an adjustment to the transaction price, or an implicit price concession. However, upon adoption of ASC 606 in 2018, estimated uncollectible amounts due to us by patients are considered implicit price concessions and are now presented as a reduction of net revenue, whereas under ASC 605, estimated uncollectible amounts were recognized as bad debt expense in other operating costs. These amounts recorded in net revenue within the Patient Care segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the

submission, collection, cash application and claims audit support activities (our \u201crevenue cycle management\u201d functions) primarily on a decentralized location by location basis. Due to the increases experienced in disallowed revenue, as well as to address certain procedural requirements of our new patient management and electronic health record system and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our revenue cycle management functions, during 2014 we commenced the process of establishing a centralized revenue cycle management organization with the strategy to gradually transition these functions from our decentralized clinics to a centralized organization. We have continued to expand this initiative through fiscal year 2018.\nAs discussed in the \u201cReimbursement Trends\u201d section above, we have experienced decreases in our disallowed revenue subsequent to the establishment of our revenue cycle management function when compared to 2014. In addition to other training and claims documentation initiatives, we believe that decreases we have experienced in disallowed revenue (as well as our overall accounts receivables balances) are due in part to our revenue cycle management initiative.\nFavorable Settlements\nFor year ended December 31, 2018, our results of operations and net income benefited from the favorable resolution of two matters.\nOn May 15, 2018, we received a net favorable settlement of $1.7 million in connection with our long standing damage claims relating to the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d disaster, and the prior adverse effect which it had on our clinic operations along the Gulf Coast in April of 2010. We do not anticipate further payments in connection with this matter as this settlement constituted a full and final satisfaction of our claims. The benefit of this settlement has been recognized as a reduction to our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn June 28, 2018, we entered into an agreement with the State of Delaware, and made payment, to satisfy all of the State's abandoned or unclaimed property claims transactions represented within the period of January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2012 which were reportable through December 31, 2017 in the amount of $2.2 million. This agreed upon payment amount was favorable by $0.5 million to the amount we had previously estimated for these liabilities and had the effect of reducing our general and administrative expenses by this amount for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, we were not required to pay interest on the previously unremitted cumulative abandoned or unclaimed property relating to this twelve year period in the amount of $1.5 million, which had the effect of lowering our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 by this accrued interest amount.\nNew System Implementation\nIn recent years we have been undertaking the implementation of a new patient management and electronic health record system at our patient care clinics. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the installation of this system in approximately 95% of our clinic locations with the plan to convert the remaining locations to the system by mid-2019. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we expensed $4.4 million, $4.3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, in training, travel, and related implementation costs. In 2019, and for the foreseeable future, we currently estimate that we will continue to expense similar amounts for the implementation of new information technology systems. In 2019, in addition to expenses we will incur in connection with the completion of the implementation of our new patient management and health record system, we also currently plan to undertake other projects related to certain new financial and supply chain systems.\nClinic-Level Claims Documentation\nIn addition to our revenue cycle management initiatives and resolution of the aforementioned issues associated with our implementation of our new electronic health record and patient management system, in 2016 we commenced more intensive training and increased our internal clinic-level emphasis on the importance of adherence to procedural and documentation standards. The absence of sufficient documentation establishing medical necessity and a patient's degree of ability for future activity is a key factor utilized by payors when denying our claims for reimbursement. Irrespective of a patient's need and the existence of a referral from the treating physician, we have found it increasingly necessary to retrieve other supporting documentation and notes from referring physicians themselves to further justify and document their medical determinations relating to the patients they refer to us. Given that these referring physicians do not work for us, the retrieval of this additional information to suit payors can be difficult and time-consuming.\nWe believe our efforts to increase our discipline through this clinic-level claims documentation initiative assisted us in further reducing the level of our disallowed sales. However, we also believe these efforts had a one-time indirect effect of reducing our overall revenue growth rate. In addition to other factors affecting our same clinic sales trends in 2016 and early 2017, as clinicians and their office administrators increased their attention on achieving higher documentation standards, we believe we were able to see and treat fewer patients, thereby contributing to our reduced same clinic patient care net revenue.\nWe continued to apply these procedural and documentation standards throughout 2018 and plan to continue to do so in 2019. With the initial implementation impact behind us, we do not believe the use of these standards was a significant factor on our year-over-year growth in 2018, nor do we expect them to be in 2019.\nIncreasing Patient Responsibility for the Cost of Devices\nThe majority of our devices are provided as replacement devices to patients with devices that are broken or have become worn with age. Prosthetic devices are typically replaced every three to five years. In recent years, an increasing number of employers have been shifting the cost burdens in their health plans to employees through use of \u201chigh deductible\u201d or \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d health plans. These plan designs typically require the patient to bear a greater portion of the cost of their care in exchange for a lower monthly premium. We believe the increased use of these plans has and will continue to have the effect of causing patients to delay the replacement of their devices and could accordingly adversely impact our net revenue.\nProducts & Services Segment Trends\nIn 2017, several of the larger independent O&P providers we served through the distribution of componentry encountered financial difficulties which resulted in our discontinuing distribution services to them. Generally, we believe our distribution customers encounter reimbursement pressures similar to those we experience in our own Patient Care services and, depending on their ability to adapt to the increased claims documentation standards that have emerged in our industry, that this may either limit the rate of growth of some of our customers, or otherwise affect the rate of growth we experience in our distribution of O&P componentry to independent providers.\nWithin our Products & Services segment, in addition to our distribution of products, we provide therapeutic equipment and services to patients at SNFs and other healthcare provider locations. Since 2016, a number of our clients, including several of our larger SNF clients, began to discontinue their use of our therapeutic services. We believe these discontinuances relate primarily to their overall efforts to reduce the costs they bear for therapy-related services within their facilities. As a part of those terminations of service, in a number of cases, we elected to sell terminating clients the equipment that we had utilized for their locations, which resulted in our recognition of $4.1 million in equipment sales in 2018, as compared with $3.1 million in 2017 and $6.7 million in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, due to customer discontinuances, we experienced a decrease of $5.7 million in therapeutic services and supplies revenue, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in therapeutic equipment sales, for a total reduction of $4.7 million in revenues we received from therapeutic equipment and services. We recognized a total of $55.4 million in revenues from therapeutic equipment and services in 2018. In 2019, we anticipate a further decline of approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million in revenue from these services associated with customer discontinuances. Within this portion of our business, we have responded to these trends through increases in our marketing programs which convey the value we believe our services have to patients at SNFs and other adjacent health services provider markets.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nIn our Patient Care segment, we have a positive view of the long-term need for prosthetic and orthotic devices and services within the markets that we serve. To address the debilitating effects of injuries and medical conditions such as diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and congenital disorders, we believe patients will have a continuing need for the O&P services that we provide. As the population grows and ages, we also believe there will be a gradual underlying increase in market demand.\nTo ensure we maintain and grow our share of this market, we believe that it will be necessary for us to find effective means to automate and better organize our business processes, further improve our reimbursement capabilities and lower our cost structure in the longer term. Our size may afford us the ability to achieve economies of scale through purchasing and process automation initiatives that could be difficult for our smaller competitors. However, our size can work against us if we do not succeed in effectively serving our referring physicians and in competing with our individual competitors in each of the markets that we serve.\nSee the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment.\nAcquisition Activity\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired two O&P businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $3.1 million, including $2.0 million in net cash and $1.1 million of Seller Notes. We made no acquisitions in 2017 or 2016.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our business is affected by the degree to which patients have otherwise met the deductibles for which they are responsible in their medical plans during the course of the year. The first quarter is normally our lowest relative net revenue quarter, followed by the second and third quarters, which are somewhat higher and consistent with one another, and, due to the general fulfillment by patients of their health plan co-payments and deductible requirements towards the year's end, our fourth quarter is normally our highest revenue producing quarter.\nOur results are also affected, to a lesser extent, by our holding of an education fair in the first quarter of each year. This one-week event is conducted to assist our clinicians in maintaining their training and certification requirements and to facilitate a national meeting with our clinical leaders. We also invite manufacturers of the componentry for the devices we fabricate to these annual events so they can demonstrate their products and otherwise assist in our training process. During the first quarter of 2018, 2017, and 2016, we spent approximately $2.3 million, $2.0 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, on travel and other costs associated with this one-week event. In addition to the costs we incur associated with this annual event, we also lose the productivity of a significant portion of our clinicians during the one-week period in which this event occurs, which contributes to the lower seasonal revenue level we experience during the first quarter of each year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates, assumptions, and disclosures. We have chosen accounting policies within GAAP that management believes are appropriate to fairly present, in all material respects, our operating results and financial position. Our significant accounting policies are stated in Note A - \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our results of operations and the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffect of Adoption of ASC 606\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. As a practical expedient, we adopted a portfolio approach in evaluating our sources of revenue for implications of adoption. In accordance with the modified retrospective method, results of operations for the reporting periods after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605.\nWe recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 was as follows:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

Care segment as of December 31, 2018 and recognizing deferred revenue of $1.0 million from satisfying performance obligations from the previous period. Estimated uncollectible amounts due from self-pay patients for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $4.2 million and are considered implicit price concessions under ASC 606 and are recorded as a reduction to net revenue.\nPatient Care Segment\nRevenue in our Patient Care segment is primarily derived from contracts with third party payors for the provision of O&P devices and is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the patient at the time the patient receives the device. At, or subsequent to delivery, we issue an invoice to the third party payor, which primarily consists of commercial insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and private or patient pay (\u201cPrivate Pay\u201d) individuals. We recognize revenue for the amounts we expect to receive from payors based on expected contractual reimbursement rates, which are net of estimated contractual discounts and implicit price concessions. These revenue amounts are further revised as claims are adjudicated, which may result in additional disallowances. As such, these adjustments do not relate to an inability to pay, but to contractual allowances, our failure to ensure that a patient was currently eligible under a payor's health plan, that the plan provides full O&P benefits, that we received prior authorization, that we filed or appealed the payor's determination timely, on the basis of our coding, failure by certain classes of patients to pay their portion of a claim, or other administrative issues which are considered as part of the transaction price and recorded as a reduction of revenues.\nOur products and services are sold with a 90-day labor and 180-day warranty for fabricated components. Warranties are not considered a separate performance obligation. We estimate warranties based on historical trends and include them in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nA portion of our O&P revenue comes from the provision of cranial devices. In addition to delivering the cranial device, there are patient follow up visits where we assist in treating the patient's condition by adjusting or modifying the cranial device. We conclude that, for these devices, there are two performance obligations and use the expected cost plus margin approach to estimate for the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The allocated portion associated with the patient's receipt of the cranial device is recognized when the patient receives the device while the portion of revenue associated with the follow up visits is initially recorded as deferred revenue. On average, the cranial device follow up visits occur within 90 days after the patient receives the device and the deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over this period.\nMedicare and Medicaid regulations and the various agreements we have with other third party payors, including commercial healthcare payors under which these contractual adjustments and disallowed revenue are calculated, are complex and are subject to interpretation and adjustment and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services. Therefore, the particular O&P devices and related services authorized and provided, and the related reimbursement, are subject to interpretation and adjustment that could result in payments that differ from our estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and reimbursement schedules, and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management. As a result, there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change and any related adjustments will be recorded as adjustments to net revenue when they become known.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers in our Patient Care segment for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 260,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Insurance/Managed Care (excluding Medicare and Medicaid Managed Care)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 316,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Veterans Administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 857,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 851,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 840,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts & Services Segment\nThe adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our Product & Services segment.\nRevenue in our Products & Services segment is derived from the distribution of O&P components and the leasing and sale of rehabilitation equipment and ancillary consumable supplies combined with equipment maintenance, education, and training.\nDistribution services revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied, which occurs with the transfer of control of our products. This occurs either upon shipment or delivery of goods, depending on whether the terms are FOB Origin or FOB Destination. Payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products to a customer (\u201ctransaction price\u201d).\nTo the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as prompt payment discounts, list price discounts, rebates, and volume discounts, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available.\nWe reduce revenue by estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances. Provisions for product returns and other allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period sales are recognized. We make estimates of the amount of sales returns and allowances that will eventually be incurred. Management analyzes sales programs that are in effect, contractual arrangements, market acceptance, and historical trends when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowance accounts.\nTherapeutic program equipment and related services revenue are recognized over the applicable term the customer has the right to use the equipment and as the services are provided. Equipment sales revenue is recognized upon delivery, with any related services revenue deferred and recognized as the services are performed. Sales of consumables are recognized upon delivery.\nIn addition, we estimate amounts recorded to bad debt expense using historical trends and these are presented as a bad debt expense under the operating expense section of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers in our Product & Services segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution services, net of intersegment revenue eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutic solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 188,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nPatient Care Segment\nWe establish allowances for accounts receivable to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. The Patient Care segment's accounts receivables are recorded net of unapplied cash, estimated allowances for implicit price concessions such as disallowed revenue and patient non-payments, as described in the revenue recognition accounting policy above.\nBoth the allowance for disallowed revenue and the allowance for patient non-payments consider historical collection experience by each of the Medicare and non-Medicare (commercial insurance, Medicaid, U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs and Private Pay) primary payor class groupings. For each payor class grouping, liquidation analysis of historical period end receivable balances are performed to ascertain collections experience by aging category. We believe the use of historical collection experience applied to current period end receivable balances is reasonable. In the absence of an evident adverse trend, we use historical experience rates calculated using an average of four quarters of data with at least twelve months of adjudication. We believe the time periods analyzed provide sufficient time for most balances to adjudicate in the normal course of operations. We will modify the time periods analyzed when significant trends indicate that adjustments should be made. In addition, estimates are adjusted when appropriate for information available up through the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.\nProducts & Services Segment\nProducts & Services segment's allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the analysis of the segment's historical write-offs experience, accounts receivable aging and economic status of its customers. Accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible are written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of an allowance for estimated sales returns.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of estimated cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) basis. Provisions have also been made to reduce the carrying value of inventories for excess, obsolete, or otherwise impaired inventory on hand at period-end.\nPatient Care Segment\nSubstantially all of our Patient Care segment inventories are recorded through a periodic approach whereby inventory quantities are adjusted on the basis of a quarterly physical count. Segment inventories relate primarily to raw materials and WIP at Hanger Clinics. Inventories at Hanger Clinics totaled $27.5 million and $27.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with WIP inventory representing $9.3 million and $9.0 million of the total inventory, respectively.\nRaw materials consist of purchased parts, components, and supplies which are used in the assembly of O&P devices for delivery to patients. In some cases, purchased parts and components are also sold directly to patients. Raw materials are valued based on recent vendor invoices, reduced by estimated vendor rebates. Such rebates are recognized as a reduction of cost of materials in the consolidated statements of operations when the related devices or components are delivered to the patient. Approximately 74% and 71% of raw materials at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively were purchased from our Products & Services segment. Raw material inventory was $18.2 million and $18.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWIP consists of devices which are in the process of assembly at our clinics or fabrication centers. WIP quantities were determined by the physical count of patient orders at the end of every quarter of 2018 and 2017 while the related stage of completion of each order was established by clinic personnel. We do not have an inventory costing system and as a result, the identified WIP quantities were valued on the basis of estimated raw materials, labor, and overhead costs. To estimate such costs, we develop bills of materials for certain categories of devices that we assemble and deliver to patients. Within each bill of material, we estimate (i) the typical types of component parts necessary to assemble each device; (ii) the points in the assembly process when such component parts are added; (iii) the estimated cost of such parts based on historical purchasing data; (iv) the estimated labor costs incurred at each stage of assembly; and (v) the estimated overhead costs applicable to the device.\nProducts & Services Segment\nProduct & Service segment inventories consist primarily of finished goods at its distribution centers as well as raw materials at fabrication facilities, and totaled $40.2 million and $41.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Finished goods include products that are available for sale to third party customers as well as to our Patient Care segment as described above. Such inventories were determined on the basis of perpetual records and a physical count at year end. Inventories in connection with therapeutic services are valued at a weighted average cost.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. For consideration of the net assets acquired, we typically pay cash and issue a Seller Note. We may also include contingent consideration with payment terms associated with the achievement of designated collection targets of the acquired business. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition inclusive of identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities are based on detailed valuations performed internally or by external valuation specialists that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. Significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly acquired intangible assets, including estimated useful lives. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and discounted cash flows from the acquired business. Each asset acquired or liability assumed is measured at estimated fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Subsequent changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration are recognized as \u201cGeneral and administrative expenses\u201d within the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from purchased businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors for a reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to bypass this qualitative assessment or alternatively determine that a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required, our annual goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (including attributed goodwill). We measure the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of income and market approaches. Any impairment would be recognized by a charge to income from operations and a reduction in the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe apply judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the implied fair value of goodwill which is dependent on significant assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows, terminal value, changes in working capital requirements, and discount rates.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded impairments of our goodwill totaling $0.2 million, $54.7 million and $86.2 million, respectively. See Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these charges.\nAs described, we apply judgment in the selection of key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test and as part of our evaluation of intangible assets tested annually and at interim testing dates as necessary. If these assumptions differ from actual, we could incur additional impairment charges and those charges could be material.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for net operating loss and other credit carry forwards and the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, and future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\nWe provide a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have experienced losses from 2014 to 2017 due to impairments of our intangible assets, increased professional fees in relation to our restatement and related remediation procedures for identified material weaknesses, and increased interest and bank fees. These losses have necessitated that we evaluate the sufficiency of our valuation allowance. We are in a taxable income position in 2018 and are able to utilize net operating loss. We have $10.7 million and $24.2 million of U.S. federal and $166.0 million and $195.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These carryforwards will be used to offset future income but may be limited by the change in ownership rules in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts between 2018 and 2038. We have $65.6 million of net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018. We expect to generate income before taxes in future periods at a level that would allow for the full realization of the majority of our net deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $8.9 million as of December 31, 2018, against net deferred tax assets, primarily related to various state jurisdictions.\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in expected future pre-tax earnings, tax law, interactions with taxing authorities, and developments in case law. Our material assumptions are our forecasts of future pre-tax earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and income represented by the deferred tax assets and liabilities, all of which involve the exercise of significant judgment.\nAlthough we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate determination of the appropriate amount of valuation allowance involves significant judgment. If expected future taxable income is not achieved a larger valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be required and could be significant, which could materially increase our expenses in the period the allowance is recognized and materially adversely affect our results of operations and statement of financial condition.\nWe believe that our tax positions are consistent with applicable tax law, but certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities. In these cases, we record the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. We record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. If not paid, the liability for uncertain tax positions is reversed as a reduction of income tax expense at the earlier of the period when the position is effectively settled or when the statute of limitations has expired. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Interest and penalties, when applicable, are recorded within the income tax provision.\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. Based on a reduced U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21% from the Tax Act, we re-measured deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future in 2017. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, in 2017, we recognized a provisional amount, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, of approximately $35 million of tax expense related to re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was recorded as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized the provisional amounts for all the enactment-dates income tax effects of the Tax Act, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to the \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section in Note A - \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements that are either expected to have more than a minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operation, or that we are still assessing to determine their impact.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated results of operations were as follows:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 v 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,048,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 364,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional accounting and legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (99.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 989,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,059,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-service defined benefit plan expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 99.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 99.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) NM - Not Meaningful\nMaterial costs, personnel costs, and other operating costs reflect expenses we incur in connection with our delivery of care through our clinics and other patient care operations, or through the distribution of products and services, and exclude general and administrative activities. General and administrative activities reflect expenses we incur that are not directly related to the operation of our clinics or provision of products and services.\nDue to the substantial amount we have incurred for professional accounting and legal services, we separately disclose these expenses within operating expenses.

To facilitate patient convenience, we also operate satellite clinics. These are remote locations associated with a primary care clinic, utilized to see patients and are open for operation on less than a full-time basis during a typical operating week.\nNet revenue. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,048.8 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 0.8%, from $1,040.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenue by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, was as follows:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 857,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 851,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 188,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,048,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $857.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 0.6%, from $852.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Same clinic revenue increased $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in same clinic revenue per day of 0.9%. This growth was offset by the effect of clinic closures which reflected decreased revenue of $1.6 million as compared with the same period in the prior year. Net revenue was also negatively impacted as compared to the same period in the prior year by $4.0 million from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018.\nRevenue growth during the year was primarily the result of growth in services to prosthetic patients. During the year, our revenue from prosthetics increased by 3.3% and constituted 54% of Patient Care's revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 53% for the same period in the prior year. We believe an increased focus on the demonstration of patient outcomes and related marketing initiatives contributed to this growth in prosthetic revenue.\nProducts & Services net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $191.4 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.4% from $188.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase was comprised of $7.3 million from the distribution of O&P componentry to independent providers partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in net revenue from therapeutic services, which related primarily to client cancellations and price concessions.\nMaterial costs. Material costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $338.0 million, an increase of $8.8 million or 2.7%, from $329.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Total material costs as a percentage of net revenue increased to 32.2% in 2018 from 31.6% in 2017 due primarily to changes in our Patient Care segment product mix to higher-cost prosthetic devices. Material costs by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, were as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 251,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 338,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care material costs increased $6.3 million, or 2.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the $4.0 million effect on net revenue resulting from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, Patient Care material costs as a percent of revenue increased slightly to 30.0% in 2018 from 29.6% in 2017, primarily due to increases in the mix of our business towards higher-cost prosthetic devices.\nProducts & Services material costs increased $2.5 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. As a percent of revenue, material costs grew to 41.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018 from 41.0% in the same period 2017.\nPersonnel costs. Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $364.1 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 0.8%, from $361.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Personnel costs by operating segment were as follows:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 312,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 312,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 364,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPersonnel costs in the Products & Services segment increased $3.0 million, or 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Bonus and commission expense increased $2.0 million, salary expense increased $1.2 million, and benefits expense decreased $0.2 million.\nOther operating costs. Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $123.9 million, a decrease of $5.9 million, or 4.6%, from $129.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Bad debt expense decreased $10.2 million, primarily from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard under which certain of these expenses were re-characterized as implicit price concessions within our Patient Care segment and are now reflected as an adjustment to net revenue. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in professional fees, a $1.4 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in other operating costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $109.5 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.2%, from $109.3 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase included $2.0 million in other expenses, $1.6 million of professional expense relating primarily to growth and other corporate initiatives, and $0.8 million in advertising expense. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million favorable settlement of our long standing claim relating to the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d disaster and $0.5 million from our favorable resolution of outstanding abandoned and unclaimed property claims with the State of Delaware, and $2.0 million in personnel related costs.\nProfessional accounting and legal fees. Professional accounting and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $16.9 million, a decrease of $19.3 million from $36.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Advisory and other fees decreased $17.2 million, audit related fees decreased by $2.0 million, and legal fees decreased by $0.1 million.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $36.5 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 7.1%, from $39.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Fully amortized intangible assets decreased amortization $2.7 million.\nImpairment of intangible assets. As more fully explained in Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the continued decline in our Therapeutic reporting unit forecasted outlook, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name. See the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.6 million, a decrease of $20.1 million, or 34.9%, from $57.7 million for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings arising from our debt refinancing in March 2018 and secondarily reflected a $1.5 million decrease related to our settlement of outstanding abandoned and unclaimed property claims with the State of Delaware in a manner that did not require us to pay a portion of the estimated interest we had accrued on long standing unpaid claim amounts.\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.2 million, or 119.6% of income from continuing operations before taxes, compared to a provision of $27.3 million, or (35.3)% of income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate in 2018 consists principally of the 21% federal statutory tax rate and the rate impact from state income taxes and permanent tax differences. The federal statutory tax rate in 2017 was 35%. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the pre-tax book income loss in the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferred tax impact related to the change in the Tax Act, whereas we had pre-tax book income in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet loss. Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.9 million as compared to a net loss of $104.7 million for year ended December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated results of operations were as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nChange (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 v 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,042,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 332,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 361,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 363,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional accounting and legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,059,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,113,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (71,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 73.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-service defined benefit plan expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (123,316\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,910\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (107,406\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (104,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (106,471\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) NM - Not Meaningful\nMaterial costs, personnel costs, and other operating costs reflect expenses we incur in connection with our delivery of care through our clinics and other patient care operations, or through the distribution of products and services, and exclude general and administrative activities.

During 2017, same clinic revenue increased $3.0 million, or 0.8%, per day, excluding the favorable effects of improvements in our rates of disallowance. Disallowed Patient Care revenue decreased by $12.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to initiatives and actions taken in 2015 and 2016 to address previous increases in disallowed revenue trends. Including the favorable effect of improvements in the rate of disallowances, same clinic revenue grew by $15.0 million, or 2.2%, per day. During the year, our revenue from prosthetics increased by 2.9% and constituted approximately 53% of our total Patient Care revenue as compared with approximately 52% in the prior year. In addition to underlying growth in prosthetic revenue, this change in mix was in part due to a reduction in revenue from certain off-the-shelf orthotics and diabetic shoes. Growth in same clinic revenue was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in revenue associated with clinic closures. During the year, we had a net reduction of 27 clinic locations due primarily to their marginal performance and profitability.\nProducts & Services net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $188.8 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 6.5%, from $201.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Within the Products & Services segment, due primarily to customer cancellations (as discussed in \u201cProducts and Services Segment Trends\u201d above), revenue from therapeutic services declined $11.0 million and sales of therapeutic equipment declined $3.6 million. These adverse trends were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in other Products & Services net revenue, primarily related to our distribution of orthotic and prosthetic componentry to independent providers.\nMaterial costs. Material costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $329.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 0.9%, from $332.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due primarily to favorable changes in our Patient Care segment product mix, total material costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly from 31.9% in 2016 to 31.6% in 2017. Material costs by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, were as follows:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Patient Care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 251,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,113\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products & Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 332,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,848\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (0.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatient Care material costs decreased $4.1 million for 2017 compared to 2016, and decreased as a percent of net revenue from 30.5% in 2016 to 29.6% in 2017. This underlying reduction in cost of materials related primarily to favorable changes in our underlying mix of orthotic and prosthetic devices during the year. In particular, reductions in revenue relating to certain off-the-shelf orthotics and diabetic shoes, which carry higher relative costs of materials than custom orthotic and prosthetic devices, contributed to reductions in Patient Care material costs as a percentage of net revenue. Additionally, we also benefited from an average aggregate reduction in the cost of components utilized in the fabrication of devices.\nFavorable reductions in the cost of materials for Patient Care were partially offset by increases in the relative cost of components distributed through our Products & Services segment. In this segment, material costs increased $1.3 million for 2017 compared to 2016, and reflected an underlying increase on a percent of net revenue basis, growing from 37.7% in 2016 to 41.0% in 2017, inclusive of the benefit of intersegment cost allocations to the Patient Care segment. These increases in materials costs arose primarily due to the loss of certain of our larger, higher margin, independent O&P provider accounts which were offset by growth in sales to other customers with lower margins.\nPersonnel costs. Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $361.1 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 0.7%, from $363.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Patient Care salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes decreased $13.1 million from the closure and restructuring of clinics, partially offset by $9.9 million increase in incentive compensation expense. Personnel costs for our Products & Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $48.4 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.6%, from $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Products & Services personnel costs were from higher incentive compensation.\nOther operating costs. Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $129.8 million, a decrease of $9.2 million, or 6.6%, from $139.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Bad debt expense decreased $4.3 million due to improvements in our collection efforts, rent and related office and occupancy costs decreased $3.7 million from the closure and restructuring of clinics, telephone and data transmission costs decreased $2.1 million, and other expenses decreased $0.8 million. These decreases were partially offset by $1.7 million increase in professional fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $109.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 2.7%, from $106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Incentive compensation expense increased $3.6 million, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes. The increase in incentive compensation was due in part to a discretionary employee bonus and 401(k) match awarded based on our performance during the year. Other office and related expenses increased $0.9 million.\nProfessional accounting and legal fees. Professional accounting and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 12.1%, from $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Legal fees decreased $8.6 million due to costs associated with the prior Investigation and Restatement, advisory, and other fees decreased $0.1 million, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in audit related fees.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.3 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 12.5%, from $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease included $4.1 million lower amortization due to fully amortized customer list intangibles for prior acquisitions, $1.2 million lower depreciation of program equipment either sold or fully depreciated, $0.4 million lower amortization of trade names, non-compete agreements and asset retirement obligations, and $0.2 million lower depreciation of software. These decreases were partially offset by $0.3 million increase in depreciation of leasehold improvements.\nImpairment of intangible assets. As more fully explained in Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the continued decline in our Therapeutic and Distribution reporting units forecasted outlook, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment. In 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $53.3 million, of which $32.8 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit and $20.5 million related to our Distribution reporting unit, and other intangible asset impairment of $1.4 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name. In 2016, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $86.0 million, of which $64.9 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit and $21.1 million related to our Distribution reporting unit. In addition, we recorded other intangible asset impairment of $0.2 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $57.7 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or 27.6%, from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $10.7 million higher interest expense associated with our debt refinancing in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.8 million related to increased interest rates and revolver activity, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.0 million related primarily to reductions in Seller Notes, escheat liabilities and lease obligations.\nExtinguishment of debt. In August 2016, we entered into a new Term B Credit Agreement, dated March 6, 2018 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), providing for a new $280.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility. We used approximately $205.3 million of the proceeds from the Term B Credit Agreement to redeem our $200 million in senior notes (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d) which were scheduled to mature in November 2018. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.0 million for year ended December 31, 2016. We incurred no similar expense in 2017.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes. An income tax provision of $27.3 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a benefit of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the Federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act which decreased tax-effected net deferred tax asset balances by $35.0 million and therefore increased deferred tax expense significantly. The decrease in losses from continuing operations before income taxes also contributed to the increase in tax expense. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was (35.3)% and 12.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax rate change impact on the deferred balance and other non-deductible expenses.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.9 million which related to contingent consideration received in 2016 from the disposal of Dosteon in 2015.\nNet loss. Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2017 was $104.7 million as compared to a net loss of $106.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nTo provide cash for our operations and capital expenditures, our immediate source of liquidity is our cash and investment balances and any amounts we have available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We refer to the sum of these two amounts as our \u201cliquidity.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of $189.2 million, which reflected an increase of $101.3 million, from the $87.9 million in liquidity we had as of December 31, 2017. Our liquidity at December 31, 2018 was comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $95.1 million and $94.1 million in available borrowing capacity under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility. This increase in liquidity relates primarily to the net proceeds of $49.7 million from the refinancing of our indebtedness on March 6, 2018.\nIf we are not compliant with our debt covenants in any period, absent a waiver or amendment of our Credit Agreement, we may be unable to access funds in our revolving credit facility.\nWorking Capital and Days Sales Outstanding\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital of $154.6 million compared to working capital of $78.7 million as of December 31, 2017. Our working capital increased $75.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in current assets of $74.9 million and a decrease in current liabilities of $1.0 million.\nOur current liabilities decreased primarily due to decreases in accrued professional fees, accrued franchise tax, and other accrued expenses of $10.0 million and patient deposits of $5.6 million. These are offset by increases in accounts payable of $7.5 million, the current portion of long term debt of $4.2 million, accrued compensation related costs of $1.7 million, and interest rate swap of $0.7 million.\nOur current assets increased primarily due to a $93.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents offset by decreases of $12.7 million in income tax receivables, $2.4 million in net accounts receivable, and $1.4 million in inventories. Cash received for income tax refunds, net of income tax payments, was $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved rates of collection and increases in our coordination of collection efforts on accounts receivable through use of our revenue cycle management group.\nDays sales outstanding (\u201cDSO\u201d) is a calculation that approximates the average number of days between the billing for our services and the date of our receipt of payment, which we estimate using a 90 day rolling period of net revenue. This computation can provide a relative measure of the effectiveness of our billing and collections activities. As of December 31, 2018, our DSO was 46 days, which is unchanged from December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nSources and Uses of Cash in the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017\nCash flows from operating activities increased $48.4 million to an inflow of $78.5 million for year ended December 31, 2018 from a use of $30.1 million for year ended December 31, 2017. This was due primarily to the changes in working capital in 2018 compared to 2017 which were discussed above.\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $26.3 million to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in investing activities included a $3.8 million increase in purchases of therapeutic program equipment, a $2.6 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment, and a $2.0 million increase in acquisitions net of cash acquired. This was also impacted by the $17.1 million decrease in proceeds from company-owned life insurance investment and a $0.7 million decrease in proceeds of sale of property, plant and equipment.\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased $72.8 million to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from cash flows used in financing activities of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase included $83.9 million related to our refinancing of indebtedness and $2.6 million reduction in payments on Seller Notes and other contingent consideration, partially offset by $12.3 million of debt issuance costs, extinguishment costs, and fees and $1.4 million in employee stock based compensation and capital lease obligations.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring 2018 we expended a combined total of $28.8 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and the purchase of therapeutic program equipment. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to our investment in leasehold and other machinery and equipment for our patient care clinics, for equipment we use in providing therapeutic solutions, as well as for the purchase or development of information technology assets that support our businesses and corporate activities. In 2019, we currently estimate that we will spend approximately $35.0 million for these types of capital expenditures. This planned increase primarily relates to growth in our leasehold and other expenditures for our patient care business, as well as for the replacement of certain portions of our information technology infrastructure.\nEffect of Indebtedness\nDue to the then pending June 17, 2018, maturity of our previous credit agreement, on March 6, 2018 we entered into a new Credit Agreement in order to refinance our indebtedness. This refinancing of our indebtedness are disclosed in Note M - \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Our new indebtedness bears reduced rates of interest compared with those under our prior indebtedness, and as such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported interest expense of $37.6 million compared with the $57.7 million we reported in 2017. Cash paid for interest totaled $31.3 million, $48.4 million, and $42.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively.\nScheduled maturities of debt as of December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 483,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 520,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 510,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Outlook and Going Concern Evaluation\nOur Credit Agreement has a term loan facility with $501.2 million in principal outstanding at December 31, 2018, due in quarterly principal installments equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of $505 million, commencing June 29, 2018, with all remaining outstanding principal due at maturity in March 2025 and a revolving credit facility with no\nborrowings and a maximum aggregate amount of availability of $100 million at June 30, 2018 that matures in March 2023. We currently believe that our anticipated operating trends, when coupled with anticipated decreases in our payments of interest expense and professional fees, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations during the coming twelve months.\nASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern requires that we evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to meet our financial obligations when they become due during the twelve month period from the date our financial statements are available to be issued. We have performed such an evaluation and, based on the results of that assessment, we are not aware of any relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that may or could have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 for each of the indicated periods:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 483,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 520,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 532,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 863,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nIt is our policy to not pay cash dividends on our common stock, and, given our capital needs, we currently do not foresee a change in this policy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K including this \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (or \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis\u201d) contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our liquidity and our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies. These statements often include words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d or similar words. These statements are based on certain assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative, that may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports.\nThese statements involve risks, estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements and elsewhere in this report, and any claims, investigations, or proceedings arising as a result, as well as our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d contained elsewhere in this report; any regulatory review of, or litigation relating to, our accounting practices, financial statements, and other financial data, periodic reports, or other corporate actions; changes in the demand for our orthotic and prosthetic (\u201cO&P\u201d) products and services, uncertainties relating to the results of operations or our acquired O&P patient care clinics, our ability to enter into and derive benefits from managed-care contracts, our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified O&P clinicians, federal laws governing the health care industry, uncertainties inherent in investigations and legal proceedings, governmental policies affecting O&P operations, and other risks and uncertainties generally affecting the health care industry.\nReaders are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those described in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, some of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those contemplated by any forward-looking statement. In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements in this discussion to reflect events and circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect unanticipated events. Forward-looking statements and our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected by the risks set forth in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or by other unknown risks and uncertainties.\nEffect of Delay in Financial Filings\nBeginning with Q3 of 2014 through Q1 of 2018, we were delayed in the preparation and filing of our financial statements. In connection with our efforts to restate our prior financial statements, remediate our material weaknesses, regain our timely filing status, and undertake related activities, we have incurred third party professional fees in excess of the amounts we estimate that we would have otherwise incurred. The estimated professional fees associated with these efforts are as follows:\n\nDuring 2018, we expended a total of $12.5 million in excess professional fees for the primary purpose of remediating our continuing material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Due to the ongoing material weaknesses in our controls over financial reporting, we currently undertake additional substantive procedures to test and verify financial statement amounts in connection with the preparation of our financial statements. We currently estimate that we will incur an additional $5.1 million of such excess fees during 2019. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe refer to certain financial measures and statistics that are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We utilize these non-GAAP measures in order to evaluate the underlying factors that affect our business performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have defined and provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis are as follows:\nAdjusted Gross Revenue and Disallowed Revenue - \u201cAdjusted gross revenue\u201d reflects our gross billings after their adjustment to reflect estimated discounts established in our contracts with payors of health care claims. Pursuant to our contracts with payors, a portion of our adjusted gross billings may be disallowed based on factors including physician documentation, patient eligibility, plan design, prior authorization, timeliness of filings or appeal, coding selection, failure by certain patients to pay their portion of claims, computational errors associated with sequestration, and other factors. We refer to these and other amounts as being \u201cdisallowed revenue\u201d or \u201cpayor disallowances.\u201d Our net revenue reflects adjusted gross revenue after reduction for the estimated aggregate amount of disallowed revenue for the applicable period. To facilitate analysis of the comparability of our results, we provide these non-GAAP measures due to the significant changes that we have experienced in recent years in disallowed revenue which are further discussed below.\nSame Clinic Revenues Per Day - measures the year-over-year change in revenue from clinics that have been open a full calendar year or more; examples of clinics not included in the same clinic population are closures and acquisitions. Day-adjusted growth normalizes sales for the number of days a clinic was open in each comparable period.\nOverview\nBusiness Overview\nGeneral\nWe are a leading national provider of products and services that assist in enhancing or restoring the physical capabilities of patients with disabilities or injuries. Built on the legacy of James Edward Hanger, the first amputee of the American Civil War, we and our predecessor companies have provided O&P services for over 150 years. We provide O&P services, distribute O&P devices and components, manage O&P networks, and provide therapeutic solutions to patients and businesses in acute, post-acute, and clinic settings. We operate through two segments - Patient Care and Products & Services.\nOur Patient Care segment is primarily comprised of Hanger Clinic, which specializes in the design, fabrication, and delivery of custom O&P devices through 676 patient care clinics and 104 satellite locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018. We also provide payor network contracting services to other O&P providers through this segment.\nOur Products & Services segment is comprised of our distribution services and our therapeutic solutions businesses. As a leading provider of O&P products in the United States, we coordinate, through our distribution services business, the procurement and distribution of a broad catalog of O&P parts, componentry, and devices to independent O&P providers nationwide. To facilitate speed and convenience, we deliver these products through our five distribution facilities that are located in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The other business in our Products & Services segment is our therapeutic solutions business, which develops specialized rehabilitation technologies and provides evidence-based clinical programs for post-acute rehabilitation to patients at approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our net revenues were $1,048.8 million, $1,040.8 million, and $1,042.1 million, respectively. We recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million, $104.7 million, and $107.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIndustry Overview\nWe estimate that approximately $4.2 billion is spent in the United States each year for orthotic and prosthetic products and services. We estimate that our Patient Care segment currently accounts for approximately 20% of market share, providing a comprehensive portfolio of orthotic, prosthetic, and post-operative solutions to patients in acute, post-acute, and patient care clinic settings.\nThe traditional O&P patient care industry is highly fragmented and is characterized by local, independent O&P businesses. We do not believe that any single competitor accounts for more than 2% of the country's total estimated O&P patient care clinic revenues.\nThe industry is characterized by stable, recurring revenues, primarily resulting from new patients as well as the need for periodic replacement and modification of O&P devices. We anticipate that the demand for O&P services will continue to grow as the nation's population increases, and as a result of several trends, including the aging of the U.S. population, there will be an increase in the prevalence of disease-related disability and the demand for new and advanced devices. We believe the typical replacement time for prosthetic devices is three to five years, while the typical replacement time for orthotic devices varies, depending on the device.\nWe estimate that approximately $1.7 billion is spent in the United States each year by providers of O&P patient care services for the O&P products, components, devices, and supplies used in their businesses. Our Products & Services segment distributes to independent providers of O&P services and to our own patient care clinics. We estimate that our distribution sales account for approximately 8% of the market for O&P products, components, devices, and supplies (excluding sales to our Patient Care segment).\nWe estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, integrated clinical programs, and clinician training in skilled nursing facilities (\u201cSNFs\u201d) to be approximately $150 million annually. We currently provide these products and services to approximately 24% of the estimated 15,000 SNFs located in the U.S. We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, clinical programs, and training within the broader post-acute rehabilitation markets to be approximately $400 million annually. We do not currently provide a meaningful amount of products and services to this broader market.\nBusiness Description\nPatient Care\nOur Patient Care segment employs approximately 1,500 clinical prosthetists, orthotists, and pedorthists, which we refer to as clinicians, substantially all of which are certified by either the American Board for Certification (\u201cABC\u201d) or the Board of Certification of Orthotists and Prosthetists, which are the two boards that certify O&P clinicians. To facilitate timely service to our patients, we also employ technicians, fitters, and other ancillary providers to assist its clinicians in the performance of their duties. Through this segment, we additionally provide network contracting services to independent providers of O&P through our \u201cLinkia\u201d business.\nPatients are typically referred to Hanger Clinic by an attending physician who determines a patient's treatment and writes a prescription. Our clinicians then consult with both the referring physician and the patient with a view toward assisting in the design of an orthotic or prosthetic device to meet the patient's needs. O&P devices are increasingly technologically advanced and custom designed to add functionality and comfort to patients' lives, shorten the rehabilitation process, and lower the cost of rehabilitation.\nBased on the prescription written by a referring physician, our clinicians examine and evaluate the patient and either design a custom device or, in the case of certain orthotic needs, utilize a non-custom device, including, in appropriate circumstances, an \u201coff the shelf\u201d device, to address the patient's needs. When fabricating a device, our clinicians ascertain the specific requirements, componentry, and measurements necessary for the construction of the device. Custom devices are constructed using componentry provided by a variety of third party manufacturers who specialize in O&P, coupled with sockets and other elements that are fabricated by our clinicians and technicians, to meet the individual patient's physical and ambulatory needs. Our clinicians and technicians typically utilize castings, electronic scans, and other techniques to fabricate items that are specialized for the patient. After fabricating the device, a fitting process is undertaken and adjustments are made to ensure the achievement of proper alignment, fit, and patient comfort. The fitting process often involves several stages to successfully achieve desired functional and cosmetic results.\nGiven the differing physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prosthesis and orthosis is customized for each particular patient. These custom devices are commonly fabricated at one of our regional or national fabrication facilities.\nWe have earned a reputation within the O&P industry for the development and use of innovative technology in our products, which has increased patient comfort and capability and can significantly enhance the rehabilitation process. Frequently, our proprietary Insignia scanning system is used in the fabrication process. The Insignia system scans the patient and produces an accurate computer-generated image, resulting in a faster turnaround for the patient's device and a more professional overall experience.\nIn recent years, we have established a centralized revenue cycle management organization that assists our clinics in pre-authorization, patient eligibility, denial management, collections, payor audit coordination, and other accounts receivable processes.\nThe principal reimbursement sources for our services are:\n\u00b7 Commercial private payors and other non-governmental organizations, which consist of individuals, rehabilitation providers, commercial insurance companies, health management organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d), preferred provider organizations (\u201cPPOs\u201d), hospitals, vocational rehabilitation centers, workers' compensation programs, third party administrators, and similar sources;\n\u00b7 Medicare, a federally funded health insurance program providing health insurance coverage for persons aged 65 or older and certain disabled persons;\n\u00b7 Medicaid, a health insurance program jointly funded by federal and state governments providing health insurance coverage for certain persons based upon financial need, regardless of age, which may supplement Medicare benefits for financially needy persons aged 65 or older; and\n\u00b7 the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nWe typically enter into contracts with third party payors that allow us to perform O&P services for a referred patient and to be paid under the contract with the third party payor. These contracts usually have a stated term of one to three years. These contracts generally may be terminated without cause by either party on 60 to 90 days' notice or on 30 days' notice if we have not complied with certain licensing, certification, program standards, Medicare or Medicaid requirements, or other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement for services is typically based on a fee schedule negotiated with the third party payor that reflects various factors, including market conditions, geographic area, and number of persons covered. Many of our commercial contracts are indexed to the commensurate Medicare fee schedule that relates to the products or services being provided.\nGovernment reimbursement is comprised of Medicare, Medicaid, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d.) These payors set maximum reimbursement levels for O&P services and products. Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (\u201cCPI-U\u201d) unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment. The CPI-U is adjusted further by an efficiency factor (the \u201cProductivity Adjustment\u201d) in order to determine the final rate adjustment each year. There can be no assurance that future adjustments will not reduce reimbursements for O&P services and products from these sources.\nWe, and the O&P industry in general, are subject to various Medicare compliance audits, including Recovery Audit Contractor (\u201cRAC\u201d) audits, Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (\u201cCERT\u201d) audits, Targeted Probe and Educate (\u201cTPE\u201d) audits, and Zone Program Integrity Contractor (\u201cZPIC\u201d) audits. TPE audits are generally pre-payment audits, while RAC, CERT, and ZPIC audits are generally post-payment audits. TPE audits replaced the previous Medicare Administrative Contractor audits. Adverse post-payment audit determinations generally require Hanger to reimburse Medicare for payments previously made, while adverse pre-payment audit determinations generally result in the denial of payment. In either case, we can request a redetermination or appeal, if we believe the adverse determination is unwarranted, which can take an extensive period of time to resolve, currently up to six years or more.\nProducts & Services\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Prosthetic Supply, Inc. (\u201cSPS\u201d), we distribute O&P components to independent providers of O&P and other customers. This componentry is provided by our supply chain operations, through which we procure, warehouse, and distribute over 400,000 SKUs from more than 300 different manufacturers. Our warehousing and distribution facilities in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas, are able to deliver products to the majority of our customers in the United States within two business days. Through its SureFit subsidiary, SPS also manufactures and sells therapeutic footwear for diabetic patients in the podiatric market.\nOur supply chain operations are an internal support organization that serves both SPS and our Patient Care clinics by procuring, warehousing, and distributing componentry. This organization enables us to:\n\u00b7 centralize our purchasing and thus lower our material costs by negotiating purchasing discounts from manufacturers;\n\u00b7 better manage our patient care clinic inventory levels and improve inventory turns;\n\u00b7 improve inventory quality control;\n\u00b7 encourage our patient care clinics to use the most clinically appropriate products; and\n\u00b7 coordinate new product development efforts with key vendors.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accelerated Care Plus Corp., our therapeutic solutions business is a leading provider of rehabilitation technologies and integrated clinical programs to post-acute care and rehabilitation providers. Our unique value proposition is to provide our customers with a full-service \u201ctotal solutions\u201d approach encompassing proven medical technology, evidence based clinical programs, and ongoing clinician education and training. Our services support increasingly advanced treatment options for a broader patient population and more medically complex conditions. We serve approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.\nReimbursement Trends\nIn our Patient Care segment, we are reimbursed primarily through employer-based plans offered by commercial insurance carriers, Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA. The following is a summary of our payor mix, expressed as an approximate percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:\n\nPatient Care constitutes 81.8%, 81.9%, and 80.6% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively. Our remaining net revenue is from our Products & Services segment which derives its net revenue from commercial transactions with independent O&P providers, healthcare facilities, and other customers. In contrast to net revenues from our Patient Care segment, payment for these products and services are not directly subject to third party reimbursement from health care payors.\nThe amount of our reimbursement varies based on the nature of the O&P device we fabricate for our patients. Given the particular physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prostheses and orthoses is customized for each particular patient. The nature of this customization and the manner by which our claims submissions are reviewed by payors makes our reimbursement process administratively difficult.\nTo receive reimbursement for our work, we must ensure that our clinical, administrative, and billing personnel receive and verify certain medical and health plan information, record detailed documentation regarding the services we provide, and accurately and timely perform a number of claims submission and related administrative tasks. Traditionally, we have performed these tasks in a manual fashion and on a decentralized basis. In recent years, due to increases in payor pre-authorization processes, documentation requirements, pre-payment reviews, and pre- and post-payment audits, our ability to successfully undertake these tasks using our traditional approach has become increasingly challenging. We believe these changes in industry trends have been brought about in part by increased nationwide efforts to reduce health care costs.\nA measure of our effectiveness in securing reimbursement for our services can be found in the degree to which payors ultimately disallow payment of our claims. Payors can deny claims due to their determination that a physician who referred a patient to us did not sufficiently document that a device was medically necessary or clearly establish the ambulatory (or \u201cactivity\u201d) level of a patient. Claims can also be denied based on our failure to ensure that a patient was currently eligible under a payor's health plan, that the plan provides full O&P benefits, that we received prior authorization, that we filed or appealed the payor's determination timely, on the basis of our coding, failure by certain classes of patients to pay their portion of a claim, and for various other reasons. If any portion of, or administrative factor within, our claim is found by the payor to be lacking, then the entirety of the claim amount may be denied reimbursement. Due to the increasing demands of these processes, the level and capability of our staffing, as well as our material weaknesses and other considerations, our consolidated disallowed revenue and its relationship to consolidated adjusted gross revenue increased over historical levels to a peak level in 2014.\nCommencing in late 2014 and continuing through today, we have taken a number of actions to halt and reverse these disallowed revenue trends. These initiatives included: (i) the retention of consultants and creation of a central revenue cycle management function; (ii) addressing the issues identified in our patient management and electronic health record system; and (iii) the establishment of new clinic-level procedures and training regarding the collection of supporting documentation and the importance of diligence in our claims submission processes. While we continue to work towards further improvements in our procedures through the use of technology within our clinic and revenue cycle functions, we do not currently foresee that future reductions in disallowed revenue will be achievable or substantial as the improvements realized from 2014 through 2017. We saw disallowed rates in 2018 slightly above 2017 levels.\nUnder both ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), and the previous revenue recognition guidance ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (\u201cASC 605\u201d), disallowed revenue is considered an adjustment to the transaction price, or an implicit price concession. However, upon adoption of ASC 606 in 2018, estimated uncollectible amounts due to us by patients are considered implicit price concessions and are now presented as a reduction of net revenue, whereas under ASC 605, estimated uncollectible amounts were recognized as bad debt expense in other operating costs. These amounts recorded in net revenue within the Patient Care segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\n\nOur accounts receivable balances for 2014 through 2018 were as follows:\n\nRevenue Cycle Management\nPrior to 2014, we performed our eligibility, patient pre-authorization, patient documentation, claims coding, claims submission, collection, cash application and claims audit support activities (our \u201crevenue cycle management\u201d functions) primarily on a decentralized location by location basis. Due to the increases experienced in disallowed revenue, as well as to address certain procedural requirements of our new patient management and electronic health record system and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our revenue cycle management functions, during 2014 we commenced the process of establishing a centralized revenue cycle management organization with the strategy to gradually transition these functions from our decentralized clinics to a centralized organization. We have continued to expand this initiative through fiscal year 2018.\nAs discussed in the \u201cReimbursement Trends\u201d section above, we have experienced decreases in our disallowed revenue subsequent to the establishment of our revenue cycle management function when compared to 2014. In addition to other training and claims documentation initiatives, we believe that decreases we have experienced in disallowed revenue (as well as our overall accounts receivables balances) are due in part to our revenue cycle management initiative.\nFavorable Settlements\nFor year ended December 31, 2018, our results of operations and net income benefited from the favorable resolution of two matters.\nOn May 15, 2018, we received a net favorable settlement of $1.7 million in connection with our long standing damage claims relating to the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d disaster, and the prior adverse effect which it had on our clinic operations along the Gulf Coast in April of 2010. We do not anticipate further payments in connection with this matter as this settlement constituted a full and final satisfaction of our claims. The benefit of this settlement has been recognized as a reduction to our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn June 28, 2018, we entered into an agreement with the State of Delaware, and made payment, to satisfy all of the State's abandoned or unclaimed property claims transactions represented within the period of January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2012 which were reportable through December 31, 2017 in the amount of $2.2 million. This agreed upon payment amount was favorable by $0.5 million to the amount we had previously estimated for these liabilities and had the effect of reducing our general and administrative expenses by this amount for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, we were not required to pay interest on the previously unremitted cumulative abandoned or unclaimed property relating to this twelve year period in the amount of $1.5 million, which had the effect of lowering our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 by this accrued interest amount.\nNew System Implementation\nIn recent years we have been undertaking the implementation of a new patient management and electronic health record system at our patient care clinics. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the installation of this system in approximately 95% of our clinic locations with the plan to convert the remaining locations to the system by mid-2019. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we expensed $4.4 million, $4.3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, in training, travel, and related implementation costs. In 2019, and for the foreseeable future, we currently estimate that we will continue to expense similar amounts for the implementation of new information technology systems. In 2019, in addition to expenses we will incur in connection with the completion of the implementation of our new patient management and health record system, we also currently plan to undertake other projects related to certain new financial and supply chain systems.\nClinic-Level Claims Documentation\nIn addition to our revenue cycle management initiatives and resolution of the aforementioned issues associated with our implementation of our new electronic health record and patient management system, in 2016 we commenced more intensive training and increased our internal clinic-level emphasis on the importance of adherence to procedural and documentation standards. The absence of sufficient documentation establishing medical necessity and a patient's degree of ability for future activity is a key factor utilized by payors when denying our claims for reimbursement. Irrespective of a patient's need and the existence of a referral from the treating physician, we have found it increasingly necessary to retrieve other supporting documentation and notes from referring physicians themselves to further justify and document their medical determinations relating to the patients they refer to us. Given that these referring physicians do not work for us, the retrieval of this additional information to suit payors can be difficult and time-consuming.\nWe believe our efforts to increase our discipline through this clinic-level claims documentation initiative assisted us in further reducing the level of our disallowed sales. However, we also believe these efforts had a one-time indirect effect of reducing our overall revenue growth rate. In addition to other factors affecting our same clinic sales trends in 2016 and early 2017, as clinicians and their office administrators increased their attention on achieving higher documentation standards, we believe we were able to see and treat fewer patients, thereby contributing to our reduced same clinic patient care net revenue.\nWe continued to apply these procedural and documentation standards throughout 2018 and plan to continue to do so in 2019. With the initial implementation impact behind us, we do not believe the use of these standards was a significant factor on our year-over-year growth in 2018, nor do we expect them to be in 2019.\nIncreasing Patient Responsibility for the Cost of Devices\nThe majority of our devices are provided as replacement devices to patients with devices that are broken or have become worn with age. Prosthetic devices are typically replaced every three to five years. In recent years, an increasing number of employers have been shifting the cost burdens in their health plans to employees through use of \u201chigh deductible\u201d or \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d health plans. These plan designs typically require the patient to bear a greater portion of the cost of their care in exchange for a lower monthly premium. We believe the increased use of these plans has and will continue to have the effect of causing patients to delay the replacement of their devices and could accordingly adversely impact our net revenue.\nProducts & Services Segment Trends\nIn 2017, several of the larger independent O&P providers we served through the distribution of componentry encountered financial difficulties which resulted in our discontinuing distribution services to them. Generally, we believe our distribution customers encounter reimbursement pressures similar to those we experience in our own Patient Care services and, depending on their ability to adapt to the increased claims documentation standards that have emerged in our industry, that this may either limit the rate of growth of some of our customers, or otherwise affect the rate of growth we experience in our distribution of O&P componentry to independent providers.\nWithin our Products & Services segment, in addition to our distribution of products, we provide therapeutic equipment and services to patients at SNFs and other healthcare provider locations. Since 2016, a number of our clients, including several of our larger SNF clients, began to discontinue their use of our therapeutic services. We believe these discontinuances relate primarily to their overall efforts to reduce the costs they bear for therapy-related services within their facilities. As a part of those terminations of service, in a number of cases, we elected to sell terminating clients the equipment that we had utilized for their locations, which resulted in our recognition of $4.1 million in equipment sales in 2018, as compared with $3.1 million in 2017 and $6.7 million in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, due to customer discontinuances, we experienced a decrease of $5.7 million in therapeutic services and supplies revenue, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in therapeutic equipment sales, for a total reduction of $4.7 million in revenues we received from therapeutic equipment and services. We recognized a total of $55.4 million in revenues from therapeutic equipment and services in 2018. In 2019, we anticipate a further decline of approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million in revenue from these services associated with customer discontinuances. Within this portion of our business, we have responded to these trends through increases in our marketing programs which convey the value we believe our services have to patients at SNFs and other adjacent health services provider markets.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nIn our Patient Care segment, we have a positive view of the long-term need for prosthetic and orthotic devices and services within the markets that we serve. To address the debilitating effects of injuries and medical conditions such as diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and congenital disorders, we believe patients will have a continuing need for the O&P services that we provide. As the population grows and ages, we also believe there will be a gradual underlying increase in market demand.\nTo ensure we maintain and grow our share of this market, we believe that it will be necessary for us to find effective means to automate and better organize our business processes, further improve our reimbursement capabilities and lower our cost structure in the longer term. Our size may afford us the ability to achieve economies of scale through purchasing and process automation initiatives that could be difficult for our smaller competitors. However, our size can work against us if we do not succeed in effectively serving our referring physicians and in competing with our individual competitors in each of the markets that we serve.\nSee the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment.\nAcquisition Activity\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired two O&P businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $3.1 million, including $2.0 million in net cash and $1.1 million of Seller Notes. We made no acquisitions in 2017 or 2016.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our business is affected by the degree to which patients have otherwise met the deductibles for which they are responsible in their medical plans during the course of the year. The first quarter is normally our lowest relative net revenue quarter, followed by the second and third quarters, which are somewhat higher and consistent with one another, and, due to the general fulfillment by patients of their health plan co-payments and deductible requirements towards the year's end, our fourth quarter is normally our highest revenue producing quarter.\nOur results are also affected, to a lesser extent, by our holding of an education fair in the first quarter of each year. This one-week event is conducted to assist our clinicians in maintaining their training and certification requirements and to facilitate a national meeting with our clinical leaders. We also invite manufacturers of the componentry for the devices we fabricate to these annual events so they can demonstrate their products and otherwise assist in our training process. During the first quarter of 2018, 2017, and 2016, we spent approximately $2.3 million, $2.0 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, on travel and other costs associated with this one-week event. In addition to the costs we incur associated with this annual event, we also lose the productivity of a significant portion of our clinicians during the one-week period in which this event occurs, which contributes to the lower seasonal revenue level we experience during the first quarter of each year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates, assumptions, and disclosures. We have chosen accounting policies within GAAP that management believes are appropriate to fairly present, in all material respects, our operating results and financial position. Our significant accounting policies are stated in Note A - \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our results of operations and the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffect of Adoption of ASC 606\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. As a practical expedient, we adopted a portfolio approach in evaluating our sources of revenue for implications of adoption. In accordance with the modified retrospective method, results of operations for the reporting periods after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605.\nWe recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 was as follows:\n\nIn accordance with the new revenue standard requirements, the disclosure of the impact of adoption on our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet is as follows:\n\nThe adoption of ASC 606 resulted in deferring $0.8 million of net revenue from our Patient Care segment as of December 31, 2018 and recognizing deferred revenue of $1.0 million from satisfying performance obligations from the previous period. Estimated uncollectible amounts due from self-pay patients for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $4.2 million and are considered implicit price concessions under ASC 606 and are recorded as a reduction to net revenue.\nPatient Care Segment\nRevenue in our Patient Care segment is primarily derived from contracts with third party payors for the provision of O&P devices and is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the patient at the time the patient receives the device. At, or subsequent to delivery, we issue an invoice to the third party payor, which primarily consists of commercial insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and private or patient pay (\u201cPrivate Pay\u201d) individuals. We recognize revenue for the amounts we expect to receive from payors based on expected contractual reimbursement rates, which are net of estimated contractual discounts and implicit price concessions. These revenue amounts are further revised as claims are adjudicated, which may result in additional disallowances. As such, these adjustments do not relate to an inability to pay, but to contractual allowances, our failure to ensure that a patient was currently eligible under a payor's health plan, that the plan provides full O&P benefits, that we received prior authorization, that we filed or appealed the payor's determination timely, on the basis of our coding, failure by certain classes of patients to pay their portion of a claim, or other administrative issues which are considered as part of the transaction price and recorded as a reduction of revenues.\nOur products and services are sold with a 90-day labor and 180-day warranty for fabricated components. Warranties are not considered a separate performance obligation. We estimate warranties based on historical trends and include them in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nA portion of our O&P revenue comes from the provision of cranial devices. In addition to delivering the cranial device, there are patient follow up visits where we assist in treating the patient's condition by adjusting or modifying the cranial device. We conclude that, for these devices, there are two performance obligations and use the expected cost plus margin approach to estimate for the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The allocated portion associated with the patient's receipt of the cranial device is recognized when the patient receives the device while the portion of revenue associated with the follow up visits is initially recorded as deferred revenue. On average, the cranial device follow up visits occur within 90 days after the patient receives the device and the deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over this period.\nMedicare and Medicaid regulations and the various agreements we have with other third party payors, including commercial healthcare payors under which these contractual adjustments and disallowed revenue are calculated, are complex and are subject to interpretation and adjustment and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services. Therefore, the particular O&P devices and related services authorized and provided, and the related reimbursement, are subject to interpretation and adjustment that could result in payments that differ from our estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and reimbursement schedules, and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management. As a result, there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change and any related adjustments will be recorded as adjustments to net revenue when they become known.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers in our Patient Care segment for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\nProducts & Services Segment\nThe adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our Product & Services segment.\nRevenue in our Products & Services segment is derived from the distribution of O&P components and the leasing and sale of rehabilitation equipment and ancillary consumable supplies combined with equipment maintenance, education, and training.\nDistribution services revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied, which occurs with the transfer of control of our products. This occurs either upon shipment or delivery of goods, depending on whether the terms are FOB Origin or FOB Destination. Payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products to a customer (\u201ctransaction price\u201d).\nTo the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as prompt payment discounts, list price discounts, rebates, and volume discounts, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available.\nWe reduce revenue by estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances. Provisions for product returns and other allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period sales are recognized. We make estimates of the amount of sales returns and allowances that will eventually be incurred. Management analyzes sales programs that are in effect, contractual arrangements, market acceptance, and historical trends when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowance accounts.\nTherapeutic program equipment and related services revenue are recognized over the applicable term the customer has the right to use the equipment and as the services are provided. Equipment sales revenue is recognized upon delivery, with any related services revenue deferred and recognized as the services are performed. Sales of consumables are recognized upon delivery.\nIn addition, we estimate amounts recorded to bad debt expense using historical trends and these are presented as a bad debt expense under the operating expense section of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers in our Product & Services segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nPatient Care Segment\nWe establish allowances for accounts receivable to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. The Patient Care segment's accounts receivables are recorded net of unapplied cash, estimated allowances for implicit price concessions such as disallowed revenue and patient non-payments, as described in the revenue recognition accounting policy above.\nBoth the allowance for disallowed revenue and the allowance for patient non-payments consider historical collection experience by each of the Medicare and non-Medicare (commercial insurance, Medicaid, U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs and Private Pay) primary payor class groupings. For each payor class grouping, liquidation analysis of historical period end receivable balances are performed to ascertain collections experience by aging category. We believe the use of historical collection experience applied to current period end receivable balances is reasonable. In the absence of an evident adverse trend, we use historical experience rates calculated using an average of four quarters of data with at least twelve months of adjudication. We believe the time periods analyzed provide sufficient time for most balances to adjudicate in the normal course of operations. We will modify the time periods analyzed when significant trends indicate that adjustments should be made. In addition, estimates are adjusted when appropriate for information available up through the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.\nProducts & Services Segment\nProducts & Services segment's allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the analysis of the segment's historical write-offs experience, accounts receivable aging and economic status of its customers. Accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible are written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of an allowance for estimated sales returns.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of estimated cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) basis. Provisions have also been made to reduce the carrying value of inventories for excess, obsolete, or otherwise impaired inventory on hand at period-end.\nPatient Care Segment\nSubstantially all of our Patient Care segment inventories are recorded through a periodic approach whereby inventory quantities are adjusted on the basis of a quarterly physical count. Segment inventories relate primarily to raw materials and WIP at Hanger Clinics. Inventories at Hanger Clinics totaled $27.5 million and $27.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with WIP inventory representing $9.3 million and $9.0 million of the total inventory, respectively.\nRaw materials consist of purchased parts, components, and supplies which are used in the assembly of O&P devices for delivery to patients. In some cases, purchased parts and components are also sold directly to patients. Raw materials are valued based on recent vendor invoices, reduced by estimated vendor rebates. Such rebates are recognized as a reduction of cost of materials in the consolidated statements of operations when the related devices or components are delivered to the patient. Approximately 74% and 71% of raw materials at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively were purchased from our Products & Services segment. Raw material inventory was $18.2 million and $18.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWIP consists of devices which are in the process of assembly at our clinics or fabrication centers. WIP quantities were determined by the physical count of patient orders at the end of every quarter of 2018 and 2017 while the related stage of completion of each order was established by clinic personnel. We do not have an inventory costing system and as a result, the identified WIP quantities were valued on the basis of estimated raw materials, labor, and overhead costs. To estimate such costs, we develop bills of materials for certain categories of devices that we assemble and deliver to patients. Within each bill of material, we estimate (i) the typical types of component parts necessary to assemble each device; (ii) the points in the assembly process when such component parts are added; (iii) the estimated cost of such parts based on historical purchasing data; (iv) the estimated labor costs incurred at each stage of assembly; and (v) the estimated overhead costs applicable to the device.\nProducts & Services Segment\nProduct & Service segment inventories consist primarily of finished goods at its distribution centers as well as raw materials at fabrication facilities, and totaled $40.2 million and $41.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Finished goods include products that are available for sale to third party customers as well as to our Patient Care segment as described above. Such inventories were determined on the basis of perpetual records and a physical count at year end. Inventories in connection with therapeutic services are valued at a weighted average cost.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. For consideration of the net assets acquired, we typically pay cash and issue a Seller Note. We may also include contingent consideration with payment terms associated with the achievement of designated collection targets of the acquired business. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition inclusive of identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities are based on detailed valuations performed internally or by external valuation specialists that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. Significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly acquired intangible assets, including estimated useful lives. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and discounted cash flows from the acquired business. Each asset acquired or liability assumed is measured at estimated fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Subsequent changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration are recognized as \u201cGeneral and administrative expenses\u201d within the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from purchased businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors for a reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to bypass this qualitative assessment or alternatively determine that a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required, our annual goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (including attributed goodwill). We measure the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of income and market approaches. Any impairment would be recognized by a charge to income from operations and a reduction in the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe apply judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the implied fair value of goodwill which is dependent on significant assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows, terminal value, changes in working capital requirements, and discount rates.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded impairments of our goodwill totaling $0.2 million, $54.7 million and $86.2 million, respectively. See Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these charges.\nAs described, we apply judgment in the selection of key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test and as part of our evaluation of intangible assets tested annually and at interim testing dates as necessary. If these assumptions differ from actual, we could incur additional impairment charges and those charges could be material.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for net operating loss and other credit carry forwards and the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, and future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\nWe provide a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have experienced losses from 2014 to 2017 due to impairments of our intangible assets, increased professional fees in relation to our restatement and related remediation procedures for identified material weaknesses, and increased interest and bank fees. These losses have necessitated that we evaluate the sufficiency of our valuation allowance. We are in a taxable income position in 2018 and are able to utilize net operating loss. We have $10.7 million and $24.2 million of U.S. federal and $166.0 million and $195.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These carryforwards will be used to offset future income but may be limited by the change in ownership rules in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts between 2018 and 2038. We have $65.6 million of net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018. We expect to generate income before taxes in future periods at a level that would allow for the full realization of the majority of our net deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $8.9 million as of December 31, 2018, against net deferred tax assets, primarily related to various state jurisdictions.\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in expected future pre-tax earnings, tax law, interactions with taxing authorities, and developments in case law. Our material assumptions are our forecasts of future pre-tax earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and income represented by the deferred tax assets and liabilities, all of which involve the exercise of significant judgment.\nAlthough we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate determination of the appropriate amount of valuation allowance involves significant judgment. If expected future taxable income is not achieved a larger valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be required and could be significant, which could materially increase our expenses in the period the allowance is recognized and materially adversely affect our results of operations and statement of financial condition.\nWe believe that our tax positions are consistent with applicable tax law, but certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities. In these cases, we record the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. We record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. If not paid, the liability for uncertain tax positions is reversed as a reduction of income tax expense at the earlier of the period when the position is effectively settled or when the statute of limitations has expired. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Interest and penalties, when applicable, are recorded within the income tax provision.\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. Based on a reduced U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21% from the Tax Act, we re-measured deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future in 2017. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, in 2017, we recognized a provisional amount, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, of approximately $35 million of tax expense related to re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was recorded as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized the provisional amounts for all the enactment-dates income tax effects of the Tax Act, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to the \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section in Note A - \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements that are either expected to have more than a minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operation, or that we are still assessing to determine their impact.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated results of operations were as follows:\n\n(1) NM - Not Meaningful\nMaterial costs, personnel costs, and other operating costs reflect expenses we incur in connection with our delivery of care through our clinics and other patient care operations, or through the distribution of products and services, and exclude general and administrative activities. General and administrative activities reflect expenses we incur that are not directly related to the operation of our clinics or provision of products and services.\nDue to the substantial amount we have incurred for professional accounting and legal services, we separately disclose these expenses within operating expenses. We have incurred these increases primarily in connection with the Restatement, the Investigation, and in connection with our accounting and remediation activities associated with the material weaknesses.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, our operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\n\nDue to the significance of disallowed revenue as discussed above in \u201cReimbursement Trends\u201d, the rate of disallowed revenue experienced during the periods encompassed by this Annual Report on Form 10-K and to assist in evaluating the comparability of expense trends, the following table provides our adjusted gross revenue, disallowed revenue, and net revenue for each year as well as our expenses as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue:\n\nPayor disallowances and patient non-payments in the above table for 2018 includes $4.2 million in patient non-payment amounts which have been treated as a reduction in our revenues commencing in 2018 in connection with our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, as discussed above in \u201cReimbursement Trends.\u201d The amount shown for 2017, includes only payor disallowance amounts.\nDuring the previous two years, the number of patient care clinics and satellite locations we operated or leased have been as follows:\n\nPatient care clinics reflect locations that are licensed as a primary location to provide O&P services and which are fully staffed and open throughout a typical operating week. To facilitate patient convenience, we also operate satellite clinics. These are remote locations associated with a primary care clinic, utilized to see patients and are open for operation on less than a full-time basis during a typical operating week.\nNet revenue. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,048.8 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 0.8%, from $1,040.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenue by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, was as follows:\n\nPatient Care net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $857.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 0.6%, from $852.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Same clinic revenue increased $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in same clinic revenue per day of 0.9%. This growth was offset by the effect of clinic closures which reflected decreased revenue of $1.6 million as compared with the same period in the prior year. Net revenue was also negatively impacted as compared to the same period in the prior year by $4.0 million from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018.\nRevenue growth during the year was primarily the result of growth in services to prosthetic patients. During the year, our revenue from prosthetics increased by 3.3% and constituted 54% of Patient Care's revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 53% for the same period in the prior year. We believe an increased focus on the demonstration of patient outcomes and related marketing initiatives contributed to this growth in prosthetic revenue.\nProducts & Services net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $191.4 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.4% from $188.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase was comprised of $7.3 million from the distribution of O&P componentry to independent providers partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in net revenue from therapeutic services, which related primarily to client cancellations and price concessions.\nMaterial costs. Material costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $338.0 million, an increase of $8.8 million or 2.7%, from $329.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Total material costs as a percentage of net revenue increased to 32.2% in 2018 from 31.6% in 2017 due primarily to changes in our Patient Care segment product mix to higher-cost prosthetic devices. Material costs by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, were as follows:\n\nPatient Care material costs increased $6.3 million, or 2.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the $4.0 million effect on net revenue resulting from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, Patient Care material costs as a percent of revenue increased slightly to 30.0% in 2018 from 29.6% in 2017, primarily due to increases in the mix of our business towards higher-cost prosthetic devices.\nProducts & Services material costs increased $2.5 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. As a percent of revenue, material costs grew to 41.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018 from 41.0% in the same period 2017.\nPersonnel costs. Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $364.1 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 0.8%, from $361.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Personnel costs by operating segment were as follows:\n\nPersonnel costs in the Products & Services segment increased $3.0 million, or 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Bonus and commission expense increased $2.0 million, salary expense increased $1.2 million, and benefits expense decreased $0.2 million.\nOther operating costs. Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $123.9 million, a decrease of $5.9 million, or 4.6%, from $129.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Bad debt expense decreased $10.2 million, primarily from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard under which certain of these expenses were re-characterized as implicit price concessions within our Patient Care segment and are now reflected as an adjustment to net revenue. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in professional fees, a $1.4 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in other operating costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $109.5 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.2%, from $109.3 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase included $2.0 million in other expenses, $1.6 million of professional expense relating primarily to growth and other corporate initiatives, and $0.8 million in advertising expense. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million favorable settlement of our long standing claim relating to the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d disaster and $0.5 million from our favorable resolution of outstanding abandoned and unclaimed property claims with the State of Delaware, and $2.0 million in personnel related costs.\nProfessional accounting and legal fees. Professional accounting and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $16.9 million, a decrease of $19.3 million from $36.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Advisory and other fees decreased $17.2 million, audit related fees decreased by $2.0 million, and legal fees decreased by $0.1 million.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $36.5 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 7.1%, from $39.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Fully amortized intangible assets decreased amortization $2.7 million.\nImpairment of intangible assets. As more fully explained in Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the continued decline in our Therapeutic reporting unit forecasted outlook, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name. See the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.6 million, a decrease of $20.1 million, or 34.9%, from $57.7 million for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings arising from our debt refinancing in March 2018 and secondarily reflected a $1.5 million decrease related to our settlement of outstanding abandoned and unclaimed property claims with the State of Delaware in a manner that did not require us to pay a portion of the estimated interest we had accrued on long standing unpaid claim amounts.\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.2 million, or 119.6% of income from continuing operations before taxes, compared to a provision of $27.3 million, or (35.3)% of income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate in 2018 consists principally of the 21% federal statutory tax rate and the rate impact from state income taxes and permanent tax differences. The federal statutory tax rate in 2017 was 35%. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the pre-tax book income loss in the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferred tax impact related to the change in the Tax Act, whereas we had pre-tax book income in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet loss. Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.9 million as compared to a net loss of $104.7 million for year ended December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated results of operations were as follows:\n\n(1) NM - Not Meaningful\nMaterial costs, personnel costs, and other operating costs reflect expenses we incur in connection with our delivery of care through our clinics and other patient care operations, or through the distribution of products and services, and exclude general and administrative activities. General and administrative activities reflect expenses we incur that are not directly related to the operation of our clinics or provision of products and services.\nDue to the substantial amount we have incurred for professional accounting and legal services, we separately disclose these expenses within operating expenses. We have incurred these increases primarily in connection with the Restatement, the Investigation, and in connection with our accounting and remediation activities associated with the material weaknesses.\nDuring 2017 and 2016, our operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\n\nDue to the significance of disallowed revenue as discussed above in \u201cReimbursement Trends\u201d, the rate of disallowed revenue experienced during the periods encompassed by this Annual Report on Form 10-K and to assist in evaluating the comparability of expense trends, the following table provides our adjusted gross revenue, disallowed revenue, and net revenue for each year as well as our expenses as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue:\n\nDuring the previous two years, the number of patient care clinics and satellite locations we operated or leased have been as follows:\n\nPatient care clinics reflect locations that are licensed as a primary location to provide O&P services and which are fully staffed and open throughout a typical operating week. To facilitate patient convenience, we also operate satellite clinics. These are remote locations associated with a primary care clinic, utilized to see patients and are open for operation on less than a full-time basis during a typical operating week.\nNet revenue. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,040.8 million, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 0.1%, from $1,042.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenue by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, was as follows:\n\nPatient Care net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $852.0 million, an increase of $11.8 million, or 1.4%, from $840.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During 2017, same clinic revenue increased $3.0 million, or 0.8%, per day, excluding the favorable effects of improvements in our rates of disallowance. Disallowed Patient Care revenue decreased by $12.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to initiatives and actions taken in 2015 and 2016 to address previous increases in disallowed revenue trends. Including the favorable effect of improvements in the rate of disallowances, same clinic revenue grew by $15.0 million, or 2.2%, per day. During the year, our revenue from prosthetics increased by 2.9% and constituted approximately 53% of our total Patient Care revenue as compared with approximately 52% in the prior year. In addition to underlying growth in prosthetic revenue, this change in mix was in part due to a reduction in revenue from certain off-the-shelf orthotics and diabetic shoes. Growth in same clinic revenue was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in revenue associated with clinic closures. During the year, we had a net reduction of 27 clinic locations due primarily to their marginal performance and profitability.\nProducts & Services net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $188.8 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 6.5%, from $201.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Within the Products & Services segment, due primarily to customer cancellations (as discussed in \u201cProducts and Services Segment Trends\u201d above), revenue from therapeutic services declined $11.0 million and sales of therapeutic equipment declined $3.6 million. These adverse trends were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in other Products & Services net revenue, primarily related to our distribution of orthotic and prosthetic componentry to independent providers.\nMaterial costs. Material costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $329.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 0.9%, from $332.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due primarily to favorable changes in our Patient Care segment product mix, total material costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly from 31.9% in 2016 to 31.6% in 2017. Material costs by operating segment, after elimination of intersegment activity, were as follows:\n\nPatient Care material costs decreased $4.1 million for 2017 compared to 2016, and decreased as a percent of net revenue from 30.5% in 2016 to 29.6% in 2017. This underlying reduction in cost of materials related primarily to favorable changes in our underlying mix of orthotic and prosthetic devices during the year. In particular, reductions in revenue relating to certain off-the-shelf orthotics and diabetic shoes, which carry higher relative costs of materials than custom orthotic and prosthetic devices, contributed to reductions in Patient Care material costs as a percentage of net revenue. Additionally, we also benefited from an average aggregate reduction in the cost of components utilized in the fabrication of devices.\nFavorable reductions in the cost of materials for Patient Care were partially offset by increases in the relative cost of components distributed through our Products & Services segment. In this segment, material costs increased $1.3 million for 2017 compared to 2016, and reflected an underlying increase on a percent of net revenue basis, growing from 37.7% in 2016 to 41.0% in 2017, inclusive of the benefit of intersegment cost allocations to the Patient Care segment. These increases in materials costs arose primarily due to the loss of certain of our larger, higher margin, independent O&P provider accounts which were offset by growth in sales to other customers with lower margins.\nPersonnel costs. Personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $361.1 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 0.7%, from $363.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Personnel costs by operating segment were as follows:\n\nPersonnel costs for our Patient Care segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $312.7 million, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 1.0%, from $315.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Patient Care salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes decreased $13.1 million from the closure and restructuring of clinics, partially offset by $9.9 million increase in incentive compensation expense. Personnel costs for our Products & Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $48.4 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.6%, from $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Products & Services personnel costs were from higher incentive compensation.\nOther operating costs. Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $129.8 million, a decrease of $9.2 million, or 6.6%, from $139.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Bad debt expense decreased $4.3 million due to improvements in our collection efforts, rent and related office and occupancy costs decreased $3.7 million from the closure and restructuring of clinics, telephone and data transmission costs decreased $2.1 million, and other expenses decreased $0.8 million. These decreases were partially offset by $1.7 million increase in professional fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $109.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 2.7%, from $106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Incentive compensation expense increased $3.6 million, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes. The increase in incentive compensation was due in part to a discretionary employee bonus and 401(k) match awarded based on our performance during the year. Other office and related expenses increased $0.9 million.\nProfessional accounting and legal fees. Professional accounting and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 12.1%, from $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Legal fees decreased $8.6 million due to costs associated with the prior Investigation and Restatement, advisory, and other fees decreased $0.1 million, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in audit related fees.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.3 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 12.5%, from $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease included $4.1 million lower amortization due to fully amortized customer list intangibles for prior acquisitions, $1.2 million lower depreciation of program equipment either sold or fully depreciated, $0.4 million lower amortization of trade names, non-compete agreements and asset retirement obligations, and $0.2 million lower depreciation of software. These decreases were partially offset by $0.3 million increase in depreciation of leasehold improvements.\nImpairment of intangible assets. As more fully explained in Note G - \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the continued decline in our Therapeutic and Distribution reporting units forecasted outlook, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See the \u201cProducts & Services Segment Trends\u201d section in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the business environment and outlook of our Products & Services segment. In 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $53.3 million, of which $32.8 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit and $20.5 million related to our Distribution reporting unit, and other intangible asset impairment of $1.4 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name. In 2016, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $86.0 million, of which $64.9 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit and $21.1 million related to our Distribution reporting unit. In addition, we recorded other intangible asset impairment of $0.2 million related to our Therapeutic reporting unit's indefinite life trade name.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $57.7 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or 27.6%, from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $10.7 million higher interest expense associated with our debt refinancing in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.8 million related to increased interest rates and revolver activity, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.0 million related primarily to reductions in Seller Notes, escheat liabilities and lease obligations.\nExtinguishment of debt. In August 2016, we entered into a new Term B Credit Agreement, dated March 6, 2018 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), providing for a new $280.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility. We used approximately $205.3 million of the proceeds from the Term B Credit Agreement to redeem our $200 million in senior notes (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d) which were scheduled to mature in November 2018. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.0 million for year ended December 31, 2016. We incurred no similar expense in 2017.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes. An income tax provision of $27.3 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a benefit of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the Federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act which decreased tax-effected net deferred tax asset balances by $35.0 million and therefore increased deferred tax expense significantly. The decrease in losses from continuing operations before income taxes also contributed to the increase in tax expense. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was (35.3)% and 12.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax rate change impact on the deferred balance and other non-deductible expenses.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.9 million which related to contingent consideration received in 2016 from the disposal of Dosteon in 2015.\nNet loss. Our net loss for year ended December 31, 2017 was $104.7 million as compared to a net loss of $106.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nTo provide cash for our operations and capital expenditures, our immediate source of liquidity is our cash and investment balances and any amounts we have available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We refer to the sum of these two amounts as our \u201cliquidity.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of $189.2 million, which reflected an increase of $101.3 million, from the $87.9 million in liquidity we had as of December 31, 2017. Our liquidity at December 31, 2018 was comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $95.1 million and $94.1 million in available borrowing capacity under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility. This increase in liquidity relates primarily to the net proceeds of $49.7 million from the refinancing of our indebtedness on March 6, 2018.\nIf we are not compliant with our debt covenants in any period, absent a waiver or amendment of our Credit Agreement, we may be unable to access funds in our revolving credit facility.\nWorking Capital and Days Sales Outstanding\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital of $154.6 million compared to working capital of $78.7 million as of December 31, 2017. Our working capital increased $75.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in current assets of $74.9 million and a decrease in current liabilities of $1.0 million.\nOur current liabilities decreased primarily due to decreases in accrued professional fees, accrued franchise tax, and other accrued expenses of $10.0 million and patient deposits of $5.6 million. These are offset by increases in accounts payable of $7.5 million, the current portion of long term debt of $4.2 million, accrued compensation related costs of $1.7 million, and interest rate swap of $0.7 million.\nOur current assets increased primarily due to a $93.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents offset by decreases of $12.7 million in income tax receivables, $2.4 million in net accounts receivable, and $1.4 million in inventories. Cash received for income tax refunds, net of income tax payments, was $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved rates of collection and increases in our coordination of collection efforts on accounts receivable through use of our revenue cycle management group.\nDays sales outstanding (\u201cDSO\u201d) is a calculation that approximates the average number of days between the billing for our services and the date of our receipt of payment, which we estimate using a 90 day rolling period of net revenue. This computation can provide a relative measure of the effectiveness of our billing and collections activities. As of December 31, 2018, our DSO was 46 days, which is unchanged from December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nSources and Uses of Cash in the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017\nCash flows from operating activities increased $48.4 million to an inflow of $78.5 million for year ended December 31, 2018 from a use of $30.1 million for year ended December 31, 2017. This was due primarily to the changes in working capital in 2018 compared to 2017 which were discussed above.\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $26.3 million to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in investing activities included a $3.8 million increase in purchases of therapeutic program equipment, a $2.6 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment, and a $2.0 million increase in acquisitions net of cash acquired. This was also impacted by the $17.1 million decrease in proceeds from company-owned life insurance investment and a $0.7 million decrease in proceeds of sale of property, plant and equipment.\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased $72.8 million to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from cash flows used in financing activities of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase included $83.9 million related to our refinancing of indebtedness and $2.6 million reduction in payments on Seller Notes and other contingent consideration, partially offset by $12.3 million of debt issuance costs, extinguishment costs, and fees and $1.4 million in employee stock based compensation and capital lease obligations.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring 2018 we expended a combined total of $28.8 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and the purchase of therapeutic program equipment. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to our investment in leasehold and other machinery and equipment for our patient care clinics, for equipment we use in providing therapeutic solutions, as well as for the purchase or development of information technology assets that support our businesses and corporate activities. In 2019, we currently estimate that we will spend approximately $35.0 million for these types of capital expenditures. This planned increase primarily relates to growth in our leasehold and other expenditures for our patient care business, as well as for the replacement of certain portions of our information technology infrastructure.\nEffect of Indebtedness\nDue to the then pending June 17, 2018, maturity of our previous credit agreement, on March 6, 2018 we entered into a new Credit Agreement in order to refinance our indebtedness. This refinancing of our indebtedness are disclosed in Note M - \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Our new indebtedness bears reduced rates of interest compared with those under our prior indebtedness, and as such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported interest expense of $37.6 million compared with the $57.7 million we reported in 2017. Cash paid for interest totaled $31.3 million, $48.4 million, and $42.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively.\nScheduled maturities of debt as of December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity Outlook and Going Concern Evaluation\nOur Credit Agreement has a term loan facility with $501.2 million in principal outstanding at December 31, 2018, due in quarterly principal installments equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of $505 million, commencing June 29, 2018, with all remaining outstanding principal due at maturity in March 2025 and a revolving credit facility with no\nborrowings and a maximum aggregate amount of availability of $100 million at June 30, 2018 that matures in March 2023. We currently believe that our anticipated operating trends, when coupled with anticipated decreases in our payments of interest expense and professional fees, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations during the coming twelve months.\nASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern requires that we evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to meet our financial obligations when they become due during the twelve month period from the date our financial statements are available to be issued. We have performed such an evaluation and, based on the results of that assessment, we are not aware of any relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that may or could have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 for each of the indicated periods:\n\nDividends\nIt is our policy to not pay cash dividends on our common stock, and, given our capital needs, we currently do not foresee a change in this policy. Certain of our agreements relating to indebtedness limit our ability to pay dividends, and we currently anticipate that these restrictions will continue to exist in future agreements that we may enter.", "item_7_tables": "Table 11: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Balance to be Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

"summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Hanger provides orthotic and prosthetic (O&P) patient care services and distributes O&P products and rehab technologies. They operate through two segments: Patient Care and Products & Services.\n\n- For 2018, they had $1.05 billion in net revenue and a net loss of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $104.7 million in 2017.\n\nRevenue Trends\n- Net revenue was up 0.8% in 2018 due to growth in the Patient Care segment. Same clinic revenue grew 0.9%. \n\n- Products & Services revenue declined due to customer cancellations of rehab technology services, offset somewhat by growth in distribution.\n\n- They have experienced high rates of claims denials (disallowed revenue) from payors in recent years leading to lower recognized revenue growth. Disallowed revenue rates improved from 2014-2017 but increased slightly in 2018.\n\nExpenses \n- Operating expenses were 94.3% of net revenue in 2018, improved from 101.8% in 2017, due to lower impairment charges and professional fees.\n\n- Interest expense declined 35% in 2018 due to lower interest rates following a debt refinancing.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Liquidity increased from $87.9 million at December 31, 2017 to $189.2 million at December 31, 2018 due to the debt refinancing. \n\n- Working capital also increased from $78.7 million to $154.6 million due to higher cash balances.\n\n- They believe their operating trends and lower interest costs will provide sufficient liquidity to meet obligations over the next 12 months.\n\nThat covers the key highlights from the report. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"}
