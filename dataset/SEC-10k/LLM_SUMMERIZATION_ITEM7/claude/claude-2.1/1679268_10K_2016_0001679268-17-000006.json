Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\u201d and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented oilfield service company serving companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing services. Our well services division provides pressure control services, flowback services and equipment rentals. Our natural sand proppant services division sells, distributes and is capable of producing proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling. Our other energy services division currently provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of completion and production and drilling related services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nOn October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TUSK.\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d or like terms, when used in a historical context for periods prior to October 12, 2016 refer to the Partnership and its subsidiaries. References in this report to we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d or like terms, when used in the present tense or for periods commencing on or after October 12, 2016 refer to Mammoth Inc. and its subsidiaries. Mammoth Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the completion of the IPO and the contribution described below completed on October 12, 2016 immediately prior to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nOn November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Company their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Lodging. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to us in exchange for shares of our common stock, and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nEach year, we evaluate qualitative and quantitative aspects of our service lines. As a result of that review as of December 31, 2016, we have split our completion and production division into pressure pumping services and well services. In addition, we renamed our remote accommodation services as other energy services. As a result, we now manage our business through five operating divisions: pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract and directional drilling services and other energy services.\nSince the dates presented below, we have conducted our operations through the following entities:\nPressure Pumping Services Division\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pressure Pumping-March 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Logistics-November 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Barracuda-October 2014\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pumpdown-January 2015\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mr. Inspections-January 2015\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Silverback-June 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mammoth Equipment Leasing-November 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWell Services Division\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Redback Energy Services-October 2011\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Redback Coil Tubing-May 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mammoth Energy Services-June 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNatural Sand Proppant Services Division\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Muskie Proppant-September 2011\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services Division\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bison Drilling-November 2010\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Panther Drilling-December 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bison Trucking-August 2013\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>White Wing-September 2014\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Energy Services Division\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sand Tiger-October 2007\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry Overview\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 continued into February 2016, when the closing price of oil reached a 12-year low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. The low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our products and services.\nThe reduction in demand during the first part of 2016, and the resulting oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, substantially reduced the prices we could charge our customers for our products and services, and had a negative impact on the utilization of our services. This overall trend with respect to our customers' activities and spending continued in 2016. However, oil prices have increased since the 12-year low recorded on February 11, 2016, reaching a high of $54.06 per barrel on December 28, 2016. As commodity prices have begun to recover, we have experienced an increase in activity. If near term commodity prices stabilize at current levels and recover further, we expect to continue to experience an increase in demand for our services and products, particularly in our completion and production, natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling businesses. Our other energy services revenue, which are currently only attributable to our remote accommodations business, remained stable through the fourth quarter of 2016. However, we currently project that our other energy services revenues will decrease in the first quarter of 2017 if we are unable to replace one customer that represented approximately 85% of such services during the year ended December 31, 2016 when it completes the construction phase of its project, which is currently estimated to occur in early 2017.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,308,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,980,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>10,024,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,851,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>33,756,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,790,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>32,042,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,032,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>30,866,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,282,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>230,998,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,936,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>86,808,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,717,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>13,540,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,144,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>28,166,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,890,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>31,847,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,489,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>13,186,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,105,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>173,549,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276,347,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>16,730,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,541,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>69,910,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,393,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>1,870,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,124,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(31,063,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,470,407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(3,711,457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,192,329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income\n</td> <td>252,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,157,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(34,523,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,820,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>53,884,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,589,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(88,407,995\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,231,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Revenue for 2016 decreased $128.9 million, or 36%, to $231.0 million from $359.9 million for 2015. Revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue decreased $45.7 million, or 27%, to $124.3 million for 2016 from $170.0 million for 2015. The decrease in our pressure pumping services revenue was driven primarily by a decline in fleet utilization from 63%, on three active fleets, for 2015 to 50%, on two active fleets, for 2016. The division decreases also included decreases due to the suspension of our pump down services in the Woodford Shale during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division revenue decreased $18.9 million, or 65%, to $10.0 million for 2016 from $28.8 million for 2015. Our coil tubing division revenue declined as a result of a decrease in average day rates from approximately $25,000 for 2015 to approximately $19,000 for 2016. Our flowback services declined as a result of discontinuing our flowback operations in the Appalachian Basin in December 2015 combined with a decline in both pricing and utilization of such services in our other basins.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $19.0 million, or 36%, to $33.8 million for 2016, from $52.8 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average sales price per ton of sand from $103 in 2015 to $59 in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tons of sand sold from approximately 512,700 for 2015 to approximately 575,400 in 2016.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division revenue decreased $41.0 million, or 56%, from $73.0 million for 2015 to $32.0 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to our land drilling services, which accounted for $35.0 million, or 86%, of the operating division decrease. The decrease in our land drilling services was driven by a decline in average active rigs from ten for 2015 to four for 2016 as well as a decline in average day rates from approximately $17,900 to approximately $12,900 during those same years. Our directional drilling services accounted for $4.3 million, or 10%, of the operating division decrease as a result of utilization declining from 36% for 2015 to 22% for 2016. Our rig moving services accounted for $1.2 million, or 3%, of the operating division decrease primarily driven by the decline in drilling activity. Our drill pipe inspection services accounted for $0.5 million, or 1%, of the operating division decrease as a result of of this business line being discontinued in the second quarter of 2016.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division revenue, consisting of revenue derived from our remote accommodations business, decreased $4.4 million, or 13%, to $30.9 million for 2016 from $35.3 million for 2015. The decrease was a result of a decrease in revenue per room night, in Canadian dollars, from $180 for 2015 to $177 for 2016. Additionally, total room nights rented decreased from 251,233 for 2015 to 230,530 for 2016.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $102.8 million from $276.3 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2015 to $173.5 million, or 75% of total revenue, for 2016. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue decreased $44.9 million, or 34%, from $131.7 million for 2015 to $86.8 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in proppant costs, repairs and maintenance expense and labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenue, our pressure pumping services division cost of revenue was 70% and 77% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance expense and a decrease in stages completed to 2,442 from 2,963 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWell Services. Well services division cost of revenue decreased $14.6 million, or 52%, from $28.1 million for 2015 to $13.5 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to declines in labor-related costs and repairs and maintenance expense. As a percentage of revenue, our well services division cost of revenue was 135% and 98% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due increased pricing pressure.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division cost of revenue decreased $15.7 million, or 36%, from $43.9 million for 2015 to $28.2 million for 2016, primarily due to a decrease in product costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 83% for each of 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue decreased $25.7 million, or 45%, from $57.5 million for 2015 to $31.8 million for 2016, primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs and lower utilization. As a percentage of revenue, our contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue was 99% and 79% for 2016 and 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance and compensation as a percentage of revenue.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division cost of revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 13%, from $15.1 million for 2015 to $13.2 million for 2016, primarily due to declines in contracted labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 43% for each of 2016 and 2015. Average revenue per room night, in Canadian dollars, decreased from $180 for 2015 to $177 for 2016. Additionally, total room nights rented decreased from 251,233 for 2015 to 230,530 for 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses decreased $3.8 million, or 19%, to $16.7 million for 2016, from $20.5 million for 2015. The decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a $2.5 million reduction in bad debt expense, a $0.3 million reduction in compensation and benefits and reductions in travel-related charges and office and computer support expense of $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for 2016 compared to 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.5 million, or 3%, to $69.9 million for 2016 from $72.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to $26.2 million of assets that fully depreciated during 2016 in addition to impairments of $10.2 million in fixed assets during 2015 and was partially offset by placing in-service of $6.6 million of capital additions.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets in 2016 of $1.9 million, which was attributable to various fixed assets. Impairments for 2015 were $12.1 million, of which $10.2 million was attributable to various fixed assets and $1.9 million was attributable to the termination of a long-term contract.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 30%, to $3.7 million during 2016 compared to $5.2 million during 2015. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in average borrowings during 2016 and the repayment of all outstanding borrowings in October 2016 with a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other income, net, of $0.2 million for 2016 compared to other expense, net of $2.2 million for 2015. The 2016 amount included $0.7 million of gain recognition on assets disposed during the period compared to a $1.4 million loss for 2015.\nIncome Taxes. In 2015, we were treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. The income tax expense recognized was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Lodging, which provides our accommodation services in our other energy services division. For 2016, we recognized income tax expense of $53.9 million compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2015. In 2016, in connection with the IPO, we became subject to federal income taxes which triggered recognition of federal income tax liabilities associated with historical earnings (See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information). The 2016 amount included recognition of other items related to the change in classification to a C corporation resulting in total one-time effect of $53.1 million. The 2015 amount included recognition of deferred taxes recorded on income from Lodging in the U.S. related to an entity election that required us to disregard previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. We made an election on entity status in September 2015 that allowed the reversal of the deferred taxes in 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,980,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,779,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>28,851,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,253,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>52,790,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,350,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>73,032,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,164,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>35,282,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,978,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenue\n</td> <td>359,936,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,526,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>131,717,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,293,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>28,144,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,715,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>43,890,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,815,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>57,489,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,571,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>15,105,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,673,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>276,347,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191,068,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>20,541,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,027,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>72,393,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,627,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>12,124,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>(21,470,407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,802,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(5,192,329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,573,933\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>(2,157,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,724,496\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>(28,820,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,503,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(1,589,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,514,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,231,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,010,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Revenue for 2015 increased $100.4 million, or 39%, to $359.9 million from $259.5 million for 2014. The net increase in revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue increased $145.2 million, or 585%, to $170.0 million for 2015 from $24.8 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to our pressure pumping services, which were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Pressure Pumping in November 2014 and accounted for substantially all of the division increase in revenue. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in our pump down services primarily driven by a decline in utilization which saw a drop in utilization from 51% for 2014 to 21% for 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division revenue decreased $16.4 million, or 36%, to $28.8 million for 2015 from $45.2 million for 2014. The decreases in revenue from both our coil tubing and flowback services, which decreased $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Our coil tubing division revenue declined as a result of a decline in demand for these services. Our flowback services revenue declined as a result of as a result of discontinuing our flowback operations in the Appalachian Basin in December 2015 combined with a decline in both pricing and utilization of such services in our other basins.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue increased $6.5 million, or 14%, to $52.8 million for 2015, from $46.3 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our pressure pumping services.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division revenue decreased $49.2 million, or 40%, to $73.0 million for 2015, from $122.2 million for 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in drilling services revenue of $41.4 million, or 84% of the net division decrease in revenue. The decrease in drilling services revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in average active rigs from 12 in 2014 to eight in 2015 as well as a decline in average day rates from $18,900 to $17,900 during those same years. For 2015, our directional drilling services division saw a reduction of $8.1 million, or 17%, of the net division decrease in revenue. Our rig moving and drill pipe inspection service lines saw a combined increase in revenue of $0.3 million, or 1%, of the net decrease in revenue primarily driven by a full year of revenue from our drill pipe inspection service line, which began operations in September 2014.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division revenue increased $14.3 million, or 68%, to $35.3 million for 2015 from $21.0 million for 2014. The increase was a result of increased occupancy resulting from the expansion of camp capacity from 498 to 884 rooms in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as an increase in room nights from 115,258 in 2014 to 251,233 in 2015. While the room nights increased, average revenue per room night declined from $206 in 2014 to $180 in 2015.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue increased $85.2 million, or 31%, from $191.1 million, or 74% of total revenue, for 2014 to $276.3 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2015. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue increased $114.4 million, or 661%, from $17.3 million for 2014 to $131.7 million for 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Pressure Pumping in November 2014. The increase in cost of revenue associated with our pressure pumping services accounted for $111.1 million, or 97%, of the increase. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 77% and 71% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization in our pump down services from 51% for 2014 to 21% for 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division cost of revenue decreased $3.6 million, or 11%, from $31.7 million for 2014 to $28.1 million for 2015, primarily due a decline in demand for both our coil tubing and flowback services. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 98% and 70% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased pricing pressures from our customers on the costs for these services.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services cost of revenue increased $5.1 million, or 13%, from $38.8 million for 2014 to $43.9 million for 2015, primarily due to an increase in our pressure pumping services. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 83% and 84% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of labor-related costs.\nContract Land and Directional / Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue decreased $36.1 million, or 39%, from $93.6 million for 2014 to $57.5 million for 2015, primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs and a decline in average active rigs from 12 in 2014 to eight in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, drilling cost of revenue was 79% and 77% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased competition for our services, which resulted in a decline in average day rates from $18,900 to $17,900 during the same periods.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division cost of revenue increased $5.4 million, or 56%, from $9.7 million for 2014 to $15.1 million for 2015, primarily due to increases in contracted labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 43% and 46% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to the increase in division revenue in 2015 associated with an increase in room nights from 115,258 in 2014 to 251,233 in 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses increased $3.5 million, or 21%, to $20.5 million for 2015, from $17.0 million for 2014. The increase in expenses was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $36.8 million, or 103%, to $72.4 million for 2015 from $35.6 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the $101.5 million in property, plant and equipment and $40.7 million in amortizing intangible assets that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC and Stingray Logistics LLC on November 24, 2014. The remainder of the year-over-year increase was\nattributable to the $111.7 million in property, plant and equipment purchased in 2014 and $26.3 million in property, plant and equipment purchased in 2015.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets in 2015 of $12.1 million, of which $10.2 million was attributable to various fixed assets and $1.9 million was attributable to the termination of a long-term contract. No impairment of long-lived assets was recorded by us in 2014.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense increased $0.6 million, or 13%, to $5.2 million for 2015, compared to $4.6 million for 2014. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increased average borrowings during 2015 due primarily to $49.8 million in debt that was assumed in our acquisition of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC and Stingray Logistics LLC on November 24, 2014. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by the repayment of $70.4 million in debt during 2015.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other expense, net of $2.2 million for 2015 compared to other expense, net of $5.7 million for 2014. The 2015 amount consisted primarily of the loss on disposal of long-lived assets, compared to 2014 which included charges associated with a then proposed initial public offering that was postponed due to market conditions existing at that time.\nIncome Taxes. During 2015 and 2014, we were treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. The income tax expense recognized was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Lodging, which provides our accommodation services. For 2015, we recognized income tax benefit of $1.6 million compared to an income tax expense of $7.5 million for 2014. The change was primarily attributable to deferred taxes recorded on income from Lodging in the U.S. for 2014 related to an entity election that required us to disregard previously recorded deferred tax liability. We made an election on entity status in September 2015 that allowed the reversal of the deferred taxes in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, one-time compensation charges associated with the IPO, equity based compensation, interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets and charges associated with the Partnership's proposed initial public offering in 2014) and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables also provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income or (loss) for each of our operating segments for the specified periods.\nConsolidated\nTable 182:

initiatives, investments and acquisitions. Since November 2014, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations in addition to our proceeds from our initial public offering. Our primary use of capital has been for investing in property and equipment used to provide our services.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our revolving credit facility was undrawn, leaving an aggregate of $146.2 million, of available borrowing capacity under this facility.\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,693,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,074,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facilities availability\n</td> <td>146,181,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,550,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less borrowings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95,000,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less letter of credit facilities (rail car commitments)\n</td> <td>(2,090,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,930,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less letter of credit facilities (insurance programs)\n</td> <td>(1,285,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,176,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital (less cash)\n</td> <td>28,323,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,276,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199,823,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,794,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,101,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,392,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,247,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(7,295,817\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24,834,909\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(101,564,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>4,659,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,931,472\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>103,125,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate on cash\n</td> <td>154,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,418,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,619,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,600,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,390,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.1 million, $68.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the decrease in net income. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to positive operating income generated by our pressure pumping services as well as cash generated by working capital changes. The cash generated from working capital changes was primarily attributable to the collection of receivables.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million, $24.8 million and $101.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Substantially all cash used in investing activities was used to purchase property and equipment that is utilized to provide our services.\nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures by operating division for the periods indicated:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,673,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,169,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>404,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,768,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,441,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant production\n</td> <td>106,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,587,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>2,709,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,650,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,801,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>424,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,679,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,317,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,251,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,690,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4.7 million, $(55.9) million and $103.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net repayments of $98.4 million under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of $103.1 million from the IPO. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings of $53.7 million and capital contributions of $51.8 million partially offset by $2.4 million in debt issuance costs.\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rate on Cash\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate on cash was $0.1 million, $(0.3) million and $(2.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year effect was driven primarily by a favorable (unfavorable) shift in the weakness (strength) of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for the cash held in Canadian accounts.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital totaled $57.0 million and $25.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our cash balances totaled $28.7 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 25, 2014, we entered into a $170.0 million revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Capital Markets LLC, as lead arranger, PNC Bank, National Association, as the administrative and collateral agent, and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto. Our revolving credit facility, as amended in connection with the IPO, matures on November 25, 2019. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are secured by our and our subsidiaries' assets. The maximum availability for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation prepared monthly. Concurrent with our entry into our revolving credit facility, we repaid all of our then existing subordinate debt with the initial advance under our revolving credit facility.\nInterest is payable monthly at a base rate set by the institution's commercial lending group plus an applicable margin. Additionally, at our request, outstanding balances, are permitted to be converted to LIBOR rate plus applicable margin tranches at set increments of $500,000. The LIBOR rate option allows us to select interest periods from one, two, and three or six months. The applicable margin for either the base rate or the LIBOR rate option can vary from 1.5% to 3.0%, based upon a calculation of the excess availability of the line as a percentage of the maximum credit limit.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and at February 21, 2017 our credit facility remained undrawn with availability of $142.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit.\nOur revolving credit facility contains various customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. Among the covenants are two financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio (3.0 to 1.0), and a maximum leverage ratio (4.0 to 1.0), and minimum availability ($10.0 million). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nAs a result of the decline in drilling and completion activity, we reduced our capital expenditures in 2015 and have further reduced our capital expenditures in 2016. During 2016, our capital expenditures included $7.7 million on our pressure pumping services division primarily for pressure pumping equipment, $2.7 million in our contract land and directional drilling services division primarily for upgrades to our rig fleet, $0.4 million in our other energy services division primarily for an intersection upgrade, $0.4 million in our well services division primarily for upgrades on a coil tubing unit and $0.1 million in our natural sand proppant services division for a conveyor.\nWith commodity prices beginning to increase in the second half of 2016 and then stabilizing at their current range, we have seen an increase in customer demand, particularly in our pressure pumping and natural sand proppant services divisions. We have increased our capital budget accordingly and, during 2017, we currently estimate that our aggregate capital expenditures will be approximately $120.0 million. These capital expenditures include $66.0 million in our pressure pumping services division for the acquisition of an additional 132,500 horsepower of new high pressure hydraulic pumps and related equipment, $29.0 million in our pressure pumping service division for tractors, pneumatic trailers and transload facilities to enhance our last mile solutions, $9.0 million in our contract land and directional drilling services division for an upgrade to two of our horizontal rigs and $16.0 million in our well services and other energy services divisions, primarily to maintain our coil tubing and flowback services lines and add new service offerings.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, and significant additional capital expenditures could be required to conduct our operations. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, as previously announced, we intend to actively pursue an acquisition strategy to enhance our portfolio of products and services, market positioning and/or geographic presence. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, and the number of opportunities coming to our attention has increased substantially since the IPO. We do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2017 since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted, however, we continue to evaluate opportunities, including transactions involving entities controlled by Wexford and Gulfport. Our acquisitions may be undertaken with cash, our common stock or a combination of cash, common stock and/or other consideration. In the event we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital for that or other reasons, we may do so through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, joint venture partnerships, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that this additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funds we need, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and commitment fees on long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>1,587,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,039,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>14,059,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,028,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,257,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,785,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,987,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitment to sand suppliers (4)\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments to equipment manufacturers (5)\n</td> <td>18,554,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,554,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,401,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,331,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,296,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,785,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,987,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The long-term debt excludes interest payments on each obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Assumption of no long-term debt balance; future charges relate to commitment fees on credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Operating lease obligations relate to real estate, rail cars and other equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>The purchase commitment to a sand supplier represents our annual obligation to purchase a minimum amount of sand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>Obligations arising from capital improvements/equipment purchases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases real estate, rail cars and other equipment under long-term operating leases with varying terms and expiration dates through 2025.

We are subject to an annual commitment of 200,000 tons of sand. During June 2016, we paid a deposit of $0.6 million to the sand supplier to be netted against future purchases of sand under this contract and deferred the commitment until 2017. We have one additional unilateral option to extend for one additional year with a further deposit of $0.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, the future commitment for 2017 under this agreement was $2.2 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire new high pressure fracturing units and other capital equipment. The future commitments under these agreements was $18.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Subsequently, in February 2017, we ordered additional new high pressure fracturing units with nameplate capacity of 57,500 horsepower and related equipment. The aggregate cost of the February 2017 commitments was $35.2 million. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2016, we ordered $6.4 million in other equipment for our natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling service segments.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we entered into railcar lease agreements with aggregate commitments of $2.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nUse of Estimates. In preparing the financial statements, our management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for self-insurance, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and future cash flows and fair values used to assess recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenue from multiple sources within our five operating divisions. In all cases, revenue is recognized when services are performed, collection of the receivables is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable. Services are sold without warranty or the right to return. Taxes assessed on revenue transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in revenue. The specific revenue sources are outlined as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services Revenue. Pressure pumping services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each day's work based upon a completed field ticket, which includes the charges for the services performed, mobilization of the equipment to the location and the personnel involved in such services or mobilization. Additional revenue is generated through labor charges and the sale of consumable supplies that are incidental to the service being performed. The labor charges and the use of consumable supplies are reflected on completed field tickets.\nWell Services Revenue. Well services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract, or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted, or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Our equipment rental services are recognized upon completion of each day's work based on completed field ticket.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services Revenue. Revenue from the sale of natural sand proppant is recognized according to the terms of title transfer on the sand. For proppant sold free on board plant, revenue is recognized when the sand is shipped. For proppant sold free on board destination, revenue is recognized when the sand reaches the customer specified transload facility or when the sand is loaded into a truck for last mile delivery depending on the specific terms of each sale.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services Revenue. Contract drilling services are provided under daywork or footage contracts, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses based on the days completed or the feet drilled, as applicable. Mobilization revenue and costs for daywork and footage contracts are recognized over the days of actual drilling. Directional drilling services are provided on a day rate or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as work progresses. Proceeds from customers for the cost of oilfield downhole rental equipment that is involuntarily damaged or lost in-hole are reflected as revenues.\nOther Energy Services Revenue. Revenue from our other energy services is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Advance deposits on rooms and special events are deferred until services are provided to the customer.\nRevenues arising from claims for amounts billed in excess of the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract are recognized when billed less any allowance for uncollectibility. Revenue from such claims is only recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue, the costs for the additional services have been incurred, management believes there is a legal basis for the claim and the amount can be reliably estimated. Revenues from such claims are recorded only to the extent that contract costs relating to the claims have been incurred. Historically, we have not billed any customer for amounts not included in the original contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from contract billing or payment schedules, resulting in revenues that have been earned but not billed ( unbilled revenue\u201d) or amounts that have been billed, but not earned ( deferred revenue\u201d).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We regularly review receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established reserves, we make judgments regarding our customers' ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of customers change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. In the event we were to determine that a customer may not be able to make required payments, we would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made. Uncollectable accounts receivable are periodically charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once final determination is made of their uncollectibility.\nDepreciation and Amortization. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment, we estimate useful lives, attrition factors and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such assets is evaluated by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flow from the assets is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The impairment test is a two-step process. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the implied value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the discounted cash flow approach, excluding interest. The impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied value.\nShare-based Compensation. The share-based compensation program consists of restricted stock units granted to employees and restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors under the Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. 2016 Incentive Plan (the \"2016 Plan\"). The Company recognizes in its financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for restricted stock based on the fair value of the equity instruments as of the grant date. In general, this value is amortized over the vesting period; for grants with a non-substantive service condition, this value is recognized immediately. Amounts are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Prior to our IPO, the Partnership and each of its subsidiaries, except Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., which we refer to as Lodging, was treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. Accordingly, income taxes on net earnings were payable by the stockholders, members or partners and are not reflected in the historical financial statements. In connection with our IPO, we became a C corporation subject to federal income taxes, which triggered the recognition of federal income tax liabilities associated with historical earnings. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information. Lodging is subject to corporate income taxes and they are provided in the financial statements based upon Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standard Codification 740 Income Taxes. As such, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or (\"FASB\"), issued Accounting Standards Update, or (\"ASU\"), No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes,\" which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The effect of the adoption is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which changes inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method (for example, inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, it requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. The ASU was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, using either a full or a modified retrospective application approach; however, in July 2015 the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year (until 2018) by issuing ASU No. 2015-14, \"Revenue From Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date.\" The Company expects to adopt this new revenue guidance utilizing the retrospective method of adoption in the first quarter of 2018, and because the Company is still evaluating the portion of its revenues that may be subject to the new leasing guidance discussed below, it is unable to quantify the impact that the new revenue standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No, 2016-2 Leases\u201d amending the current accounting for leases. Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments for all leases with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less. All other leases will fall into one of two categories: (i) a financing lease or (ii) an operating lease. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. For sale leaseback transactions, a sale will only be recognized if the criteria in the new revenue recognition standard are met. ASU 2016-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Since a portion of the Company's revenue may be subject to this new leasing guidance, it expects to adopt this updated leasing guidance at the same time its adopts the new revenue standard discussed above, utilizing the retrospective method of adoption. This new leasing guidance will also impact the Company in situations where it is the lessee, and in certain circumstances it will have a right-of-use asset and lease liability on its consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\u201d and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented oilfield service company serving companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing services. Our well services division provides pressure control services, flowback services and equipment rentals. Our natural sand proppant services division sells, distributes and is capable of producing proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling. Our other energy services division currently provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of completion and production and drilling related services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nOn October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TUSK.\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d or like terms, when used in a historical context for periods prior to October 12, 2016 refer to the Partnership and its subsidiaries. References in this report to we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d or like terms, when used in the present tense or for periods commencing on or after October 12, 2016 refer to Mammoth Inc. and its subsidiaries. Mammoth Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the completion of the IPO and the contribution described below completed on October 12, 2016 immediately prior to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nOn November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Company their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Lodging. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to us in exchange for shares of our common stock, and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nEach year, we evaluate qualitative and quantitative aspects of our service lines. As a result of that review as of December 31, 2016, we have split our completion and production division into pressure pumping services and well services. In addition, we renamed our remote accommodation services as other energy services. As a result, we now manage our business through five operating divisions: pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract and directional drilling services and other energy services.\nSince the dates presented below, we have conducted our operations through the following entities:\nPressure Pumping Services Division\n \u2022 Pressure Pumping-March 2012 \n \u2022 Logistics-November 2012 \n \u2022 Barracuda-October 2014 \n \u2022 Pumpdown-January 2015 \n \u2022 Mr. Inspections-January 2015 \n \u2022 Silverback-June 2016 \n \u2022 Mammoth Equipment Leasing-November 2016 \nWell Services Division\n \u2022 Redback Energy Services-October 2011 \n \u2022 Redback Coil Tubing-May 2012 \n \u2022 Mammoth Energy Services-June 2016 \nNatural Sand Proppant Services Division\n \u2022 Muskie Proppant-September 2011 \nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services Division\n \u2022 Bison Drilling-November 2010 \n \u2022 Panther Drilling-December 2012 \n \u2022 Bison Trucking-August 2013 \n \u2022 White Wing-September 2014 \nOther Energy Services Division\n \u2022 Sand Tiger-October 2007 \nIndustry Overview\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 continued into February 2016, when the closing price of oil reached a 12-year low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. The low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our products and services.\nThe reduction in demand during the first part of 2016, and the resulting oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, substantially reduced the prices we could charge our customers for our products and services, and had a negative impact on the utilization of our services. This overall trend with respect to our customers' activities and spending continued in 2016. However, oil prices have increased since the 12-year low recorded on February 11, 2016, reaching a high of $54.06 per barrel on December 28, 2016. As commodity prices have begun to recover, we have experienced an increase in activity. If near term commodity prices stabilize at current levels and recover further, we expect to continue to experience an increase in demand for our services and products, particularly in our completion and production, natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling businesses. Our other energy services revenue, which are currently only attributable to our remote accommodations business, remained stable through the fourth quarter of 2016. However, we currently project that our other energy services revenues will decrease in the first quarter of 2017 if we are unable to replace one customer that represented approximately 85% of such services during the year ended December 31, 2016 when it completes the construction phase of its project, which is currently estimated to occur in early 2017.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,308,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,980,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>10,024,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,851,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>33,756,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,790,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>32,042,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,032,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>30,866,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,282,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>230,998,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,936,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>86,808,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,717,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>13,540,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,144,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>28,166,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,890,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>31,847,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,489,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>13,186,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,105,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>173,549,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276,347,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>16,730,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,541,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>69,910,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,393,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>1,870,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,124,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(31,063,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,470,407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(3,711,457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,192,329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income\n</td> <td>252,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,157,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(34,523,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,820,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>53,884,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,589,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(88,407,995\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,231,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Revenue for 2016 decreased $128.9 million, or 36%, to $231.0 million from $359.9 million for 2015. Revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue decreased $45.7 million, or 27%, to $124.3 million for 2016 from $170.0 million for 2015. The decrease in our pressure pumping services revenue was driven primarily by a decline in fleet utilization from 63%, on three active fleets, for 2015 to 50%, on two active fleets, for 2016. The division decreases also included decreases due to the suspension of our pump down services in the Woodford Shale during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division revenue decreased $18.9 million, or 65%, to $10.0 million for 2016 from $28.8 million for 2015. Our coil tubing division revenue declined as a result of a decrease in average day rates from approximately $25,000 for 2015 to approximately $19,000 for 2016. Our flowback services declined as a result of discontinuing our flowback operations in the Appalachian Basin in December 2015 combined with a decline in both pricing and utilization of such services in our other basins.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $19.0 million, or 36%, to $33.8 million for 2016, from $52.8 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average sales price per ton of sand from $103 in 2015 to $59 in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tons of sand sold from approximately 512,700 for 2015 to approximately 575,400 in 2016.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division revenue decreased $41.0 million, or 56%, from $73.0 million for 2015 to $32.0 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to our land drilling services, which accounted for $35.0 million, or 86%, of the operating division decrease. The decrease in our land drilling services was driven by a decline in average active rigs from ten for 2015 to four for 2016 as well as a decline in average day rates from approximately $17,900 to approximately $12,900 during those same years. Our directional drilling services accounted for $4.3 million, or 10%, of the operating division decrease as a result of utilization declining from 36% for 2015 to 22% for 2016. Our rig moving services accounted for $1.2 million, or 3%, of the operating division decrease primarily driven by the decline in drilling activity. Our drill pipe inspection services accounted for $0.5 million, or 1%, of the operating division decrease as a result of of this business line being discontinued in the second quarter of 2016.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division revenue, consisting of revenue derived from our remote accommodations business, decreased $4.4 million, or 13%, to $30.9 million for 2016 from $35.3 million for 2015. The decrease was a result of a decrease in revenue per room night, in Canadian dollars, from $180 for 2015 to $177 for 2016. Additionally, total room nights rented decreased from 251,233 for 2015 to 230,530 for 2016.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $102.8 million from $276.3 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2015 to $173.5 million, or 75% of total revenue, for 2016. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue decreased $44.9 million, or 34%, from $131.7 million for 2015 to $86.8 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in proppant costs, repairs and maintenance expense and labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenue, our pressure pumping services division cost of revenue was 70% and 77% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance expense and a decrease in stages completed to 2,442 from 2,963 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWell Services. Well services division cost of revenue decreased $14.6 million, or 52%, from $28.1 million for 2015 to $13.5 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to declines in labor-related costs and repairs and maintenance expense. As a percentage of revenue, our well services division cost of revenue was 135% and 98% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due increased pricing pressure.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division cost of revenue decreased $15.7 million, or 36%, from $43.9 million for 2015 to $28.2 million for 2016, primarily due to a decrease in product costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 83% for each of 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue decreased $25.7 million, or 45%, from $57.5 million for 2015 to $31.8 million for 2016, primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs and lower utilization. As a percentage of revenue, our contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue was 99% and 79% for 2016 and 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance and compensation as a percentage of revenue.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division cost of revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 13%, from $15.1 million for 2015 to $13.2 million for 2016, primarily due to declines in contracted labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 43% for each of 2016 and 2015. Average revenue per room night, in Canadian dollars, decreased from $180 for 2015 to $177 for 2016. Additionally, total room nights rented decreased from 251,233 for 2015 to 230,530 for 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses decreased $3.8 million, or 19%, to $16.7 million for 2016, from $20.5 million for 2015. The decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a $2.5 million reduction in bad debt expense, a $0.3 million reduction in compensation and benefits and reductions in travel-related charges and office and computer support expense of $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for 2016 compared to 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.5 million, or 3%, to $69.9 million for 2016 from $72.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to $26.2 million of assets that fully depreciated during 2016 in addition to impairments of $10.2 million in fixed assets during 2015 and was partially offset by placing in-service of $6.6 million of capital additions.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets in 2016 of $1.9 million, which was attributable to various fixed assets. Impairments for 2015 were $12.1 million, of which $10.2 million was attributable to various fixed assets and $1.9 million was attributable to the termination of a long-term contract.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 30%, to $3.7 million during 2016 compared to $5.2 million during 2015. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in average borrowings during 2016 and the repayment of all outstanding borrowings in October 2016 with a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other income, net, of $0.2 million for 2016 compared to other expense, net of $2.2 million for 2015. The 2016 amount included $0.7 million of gain recognition on assets disposed during the period compared to a $1.4 million loss for 2015.\nIncome Taxes. In 2015, we were treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. The income tax expense recognized was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Lodging, which provides our accommodation services in our other energy services division. For 2016, we recognized income tax expense of $53.9 million compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2015. In 2016, in connection with the IPO, we became subject to federal income taxes which triggered recognition of federal income tax liabilities associated with historical earnings (See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information). The 2016 amount included recognition of other items related to the change in classification to a C corporation resulting in total one-time effect of $53.1 million. The 2015 amount included recognition of deferred taxes recorded on income from Lodging in the U.S. related to an entity election that required us to disregard previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. We made an election on entity status in September 2015 that allowed the reversal of the deferred taxes in 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,980,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,779,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>28,851,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,253,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>52,790,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,350,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>73,032,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,164,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>35,282,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,978,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenue\n</td> <td>359,936,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,526,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>131,717,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,293,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>28,144,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,715,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant services\n</td> <td>43,890,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,815,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract land and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>57,489,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,571,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>15,105,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,673,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>276,347,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191,068,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>20,541,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,027,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>72,393,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,627,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>12,124,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>(21,470,407\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,802,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(5,192,329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,573,933\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>(2,157,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,724,496\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>(28,820,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,503,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(1,589,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,514,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,231,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,010,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Revenue for 2015 increased $100.4 million, or 39%, to $359.9 million from $259.5 million for 2014. The net increase in revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue increased $145.2 million, or 585%, to $170.0 million for 2015 from $24.8 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to our pressure pumping services, which were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Pressure Pumping in November 2014 and accounted for substantially all of the division increase in revenue. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in our pump down services primarily driven by a decline in utilization which saw a drop in utilization from 51% for 2014 to 21% for 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division revenue decreased $16.4 million, or 36%, to $28.8 million for 2015 from $45.2 million for 2014. The decreases in revenue from both our coil tubing and flowback services, which decreased $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Our coil tubing division revenue declined as a result of a decline in demand for these services. Our flowback services revenue declined as a result of as a result of discontinuing our flowback operations in the Appalachian Basin in December 2015 combined with a decline in both pricing and utilization of such services in our other basins.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue increased $6.5 million, or 14%, to $52.8 million for 2015, from $46.3 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our pressure pumping services.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division revenue decreased $49.2 million, or 40%, to $73.0 million for 2015, from $122.2 million for 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in drilling services revenue of $41.4 million, or 84% of the net division decrease in revenue. The decrease in drilling services revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in average active rigs from 12 in 2014 to eight in 2015 as well as a decline in average day rates from $18,900 to $17,900 during those same years. For 2015, our directional drilling services division saw a reduction of $8.1 million, or 17%, of the net division decrease in revenue. Our rig moving and drill pipe inspection service lines saw a combined increase in revenue of $0.3 million, or 1%, of the net decrease in revenue primarily driven by a full year of revenue from our drill pipe inspection service line, which began operations in September 2014.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division revenue increased $14.3 million, or 68%, to $35.3 million for 2015 from $21.0 million for 2014. The increase was a result of increased occupancy resulting from the expansion of camp capacity from 498 to 884 rooms in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as an increase in room nights from 115,258 in 2014 to 251,233 in 2015. While the room nights increased, average revenue per room night declined from $206 in 2014 to $180 in 2015.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue increased $85.2 million, or 31%, from $191.1 million, or 74% of total revenue, for 2014 to $276.3 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2015. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue increased $114.4 million, or 661%, from $17.3 million for 2014 to $131.7 million for 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Pressure Pumping in November 2014. The increase in cost of revenue associated with our pressure pumping services accounted for $111.1 million, or 97%, of the increase. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 77% and 71% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization in our pump down services from 51% for 2014 to 21% for 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division cost of revenue decreased $3.6 million, or 11%, from $31.7 million for 2014 to $28.1 million for 2015, primarily due a decline in demand for both our coil tubing and flowback services. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 98% and 70% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased pricing pressures from our customers on the costs for these services.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services cost of revenue increased $5.1 million, or 13%, from $38.8 million for 2014 to $43.9 million for 2015, primarily due to an increase in our pressure pumping services. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 83% and 84% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of labor-related costs.\nContract Land and Directional / Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue decreased $36.1 million, or 39%, from $93.6 million for 2014 to $57.5 million for 2015, primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs and a decline in average active rigs from 12 in 2014 to eight in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, drilling cost of revenue was 79% and 77% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased competition for our services, which resulted in a decline in average day rates from $18,900 to $17,900 during the same periods.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division cost of revenue increased $5.4 million, or 56%, from $9.7 million for 2014 to $15.1 million for 2015, primarily due to increases in contracted labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 43% and 46% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to the increase in division revenue in 2015 associated with an increase in room nights from 115,258 in 2014 to 251,233 in 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses increased $3.5 million, or 21%, to $20.5 million for 2015, from $17.0 million for 2014. The increase in expenses was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $36.8 million, or 103%, to $72.4 million for 2015 from $35.6 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the $101.5 million in property, plant and equipment and $40.7 million in amortizing intangible assets that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC and Stingray Logistics LLC on November 24, 2014. The remainder of the year-over-year increase was\nattributable to the $111.7 million in property, plant and equipment purchased in 2014 and $26.3 million in property, plant and equipment purchased in 2015.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets in 2015 of $12.1 million, of which $10.2 million was attributable to various fixed assets and $1.9 million was attributable to the termination of a long-term contract. No impairment of long-lived assets was recorded by us in 2014.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense increased $0.6 million, or 13%, to $5.2 million for 2015, compared to $4.6 million for 2014. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increased average borrowings during 2015 due primarily to $49.8 million in debt that was assumed in our acquisition of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC and Stingray Logistics LLC on November 24, 2014. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by the repayment of $70.4 million in debt during 2015.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other expense, net of $2.2 million for 2015 compared to other expense, net of $5.7 million for 2014. The 2015 amount consisted primarily of the loss on disposal of long-lived assets, compared to 2014 which included charges associated with a then proposed initial public offering that was postponed due to market conditions existing at that time.\nIncome Taxes. During 2015 and 2014, we were treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. The income tax expense recognized was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Lodging, which provides our accommodation services. For 2015, we recognized income tax benefit of $1.6 million compared to an income tax expense of $7.5 million for 2014. The change was primarily attributable to deferred taxes recorded on income from Lodging in the U.S. for 2014 related to an entity election that required us to disregard previously recorded deferred tax liability. We made an election on entity status in September 2015 that allowed the reversal of the deferred taxes in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, one-time compensation charges associated with the IPO, equity based compensation, interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets and charges associated with the Partnership's proposed initial public offering in 2014) and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables also provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income or (loss) for each of our operating segments for the specified periods.\nConsolidated\nTable 182:

Our primary use of capital has been for investing in property and equipment used to provide our services.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our revolving credit facility was undrawn, leaving an aggregate of $146.2 million, of available borrowing capacity under this facility.\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity as of the dates indicated:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,693,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,074,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facilities availability\n</td> <td>146,181,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,550,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less borrowings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95,000,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less letter of credit facilities (rail car commitments)\n</td> <td>(2,090,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,930,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less letter of credit facilities (insurance programs)\n</td> <td>(1,285,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,176,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital (less cash)\n</td> <td>28,323,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,276,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199,823,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,794,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,101,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,392,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,247,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(7,295,817\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24,834,909\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(101,564,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>4,659,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,931,472\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>103,125,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate on cash\n</td> <td>154,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,418,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,619,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,600,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,390,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.1 million, $68.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the decrease in net income. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to positive operating income generated by our pressure pumping services as well as cash generated by working capital changes. The cash generated from working capital changes was primarily attributable to the collection of receivables.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million, $24.8 million and $101.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Substantially all cash used in investing activities was used to purchase property and equipment that is utilized to provide our services.\nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures by operating division for the periods indicated:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pressure pumping services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,673,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,169,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well services\n</td> <td>404,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,768,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,441,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural sand proppant production\n</td> <td>106,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,587,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract and directional drilling services\n</td> <td>2,709,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,650,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,801,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other energy services\n</td> <td>424,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,679,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,317,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,251,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,690,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4.7 million, $(55.9) million and $103.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net repayments of $98.4 million under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of $103.1 million from the IPO. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings of $53.7 million and capital contributions of $51.8 million partially offset by $2.4 million in debt issuance costs.\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rate on Cash\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate on cash was $0.1 million, $(0.3) million and $(2.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year effect was driven primarily by a favorable (unfavorable) shift in the weakness (strength) of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for the cash held in Canadian accounts.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital totaled $57.0 million and $25.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our cash balances totaled $28.7 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 25, 2014, we entered into a $170.0 million revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Capital Markets LLC, as lead arranger, PNC Bank, National Association, as the administrative and collateral agent, and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto. Our revolving credit facility, as amended in connection with the IPO, matures on November 25, 2019. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are secured by our and our subsidiaries' assets. The maximum availability for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation prepared monthly. Concurrent with our entry into our revolving credit facility, we repaid all of our then existing subordinate debt with the initial advance under our revolving credit facility.\nInterest is payable monthly at a base rate set by the institution's commercial lending group plus an applicable margin. Additionally, at our request, outstanding balances, are permitted to be converted to LIBOR rate plus applicable margin tranches at set increments of $500,000. The LIBOR rate option allows us to select interest periods from one, two, and three or six months. The applicable margin for either the base rate or the LIBOR rate option can vary from 1.5% to 3.0%, based upon a calculation of the excess availability of the line as a percentage of the maximum credit limit.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and at February 21, 2017 our credit facility remained undrawn with availability of $142.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit.\nOur revolving credit facility contains various customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. Among the covenants are two financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio (3.0 to 1.0), and a maximum leverage ratio (4.0 to 1.0), and minimum availability ($10.0 million). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nAs a result of the decline in drilling and completion activity, we reduced our capital expenditures in 2015 and have further reduced our capital expenditures in 2016. During 2016, our capital expenditures included $7.7 million on our pressure pumping services division primarily for pressure pumping equipment, $2.7 million in our contract land and directional drilling services division primarily for upgrades to our rig fleet, $0.4 million in our other energy services division primarily for an intersection upgrade, $0.4 million in our well services division primarily for upgrades on a coil tubing unit and $0.1 million in our natural sand proppant services division for a conveyor.\nWith commodity prices beginning to increase in the second half of 2016 and then stabilizing at their current range, we have seen an increase in customer demand, particularly in our pressure pumping and natural sand proppant services divisions. We have increased our capital budget accordingly and, during 2017, we currently estimate that our aggregate capital expenditures will be approximately $120.0 million. These capital expenditures include $66.0 million in our pressure pumping services division for the acquisition of an additional 132,500 horsepower of new high pressure hydraulic pumps and related equipment, $29.0 million in our pressure pumping service division for tractors, pneumatic trailers and transload facilities to enhance our last mile solutions, $9.0 million in our contract land and directional drilling services division for an upgrade to two of our horizontal rigs and $16.0 million in our well services and other energy services divisions, primarily to maintain our coil tubing and flowback services lines and add new service offerings.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, and significant additional capital expenditures could be required to conduct our operations. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, as previously announced, we intend to actively pursue an acquisition strategy to enhance our portfolio of products and services, market positioning and/or geographic presence. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, and the number of opportunities coming to our attention has increased substantially since the IPO. We do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2017 since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted, however, we continue to evaluate opportunities, including transactions involving entities controlled by Wexford and Gulfport. Our acquisitions may be undertaken with cash, our common stock or a combination of cash, common stock and/or other consideration. In the event we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital for that or other reasons, we may do so through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, joint venture partnerships, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that this additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funds we need, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and commitment fees on long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>1,587,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,039,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>14,059,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,028,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,257,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,785,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,987,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitment to sand suppliers (4)\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments to equipment manufacturers (5)\n</td> <td>18,554,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,554,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,401,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,331,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,296,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,785,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,987,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The long-term debt excludes interest payments on each obligation. \n (2) Assumption of no long-term debt balance; future charges relate to commitment fees on credit facility. \n (3) Operating lease obligations relate to real estate, rail cars and other equipment. \n (4) The purchase commitment to a sand supplier represents our annual obligation to purchase a minimum amount of sand. \n (5) Obligations arising from capital improvements/equipment purchases. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases real estate, rail cars and other equipment under long-term operating leases with varying terms and expiration dates through 2025.

We are subject to an annual commitment of 200,000 tons of sand. During June 2016, we paid a deposit of $0.6 million to the sand supplier to be netted against future purchases of sand under this contract and deferred the commitment until 2017. We have one additional unilateral option to extend for one additional year with a further deposit of $0.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, the future commitment for 2017 under this agreement was $2.2 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire new high pressure fracturing units and other capital equipment. The future commitments under these agreements was $18.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Subsequently, in February 2017, we ordered additional new high pressure fracturing units with nameplate capacity of 57,500 horsepower and related equipment. The aggregate cost of the February 2017 commitments was $35.2 million. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2016, we ordered $6.4 million in other equipment for our natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling service segments.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we entered into railcar lease agreements with aggregate commitments of $2.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nUse of Estimates. In preparing the financial statements, our management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for self-insurance, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and future cash flows and fair values used to assess recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenue from multiple sources within our five operating divisions. In all cases, revenue is recognized when services are performed, collection of the receivables is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable. Services are sold without warranty or the right to return. Taxes assessed on revenue transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in revenue. The specific revenue sources are outlined as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services Revenue. Pressure pumping services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each day's work based upon a completed field ticket, which includes the charges for the services performed, mobilization of the equipment to the location and the personnel involved in such services or mobilization. Additional revenue is generated through labor charges and the sale of consumable supplies that are incidental to the service being performed. The labor charges and the use of consumable supplies are reflected on completed field tickets.\nWell Services Revenue. Well services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract, or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted, or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Our equipment rental services are recognized upon completion of each day's work based on completed field ticket.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services Revenue. Revenue from the sale of natural sand proppant is recognized according to the terms of title transfer on the sand. For proppant sold free on board plant, revenue is recognized when the sand is shipped. For proppant sold free on board destination, revenue is recognized when the sand reaches the customer specified transload facility or when the sand is loaded into a truck for last mile delivery depending on the specific terms of each sale.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services Revenue. Contract drilling services are provided under daywork or footage contracts, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses based on the days completed or the feet drilled, as applicable. Mobilization revenue and costs for daywork and footage contracts are recognized over the days of actual drilling. Directional drilling services are provided on a day rate or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as work progresses. Proceeds from customers for the cost of oilfield downhole rental equipment that is involuntarily damaged or lost in-hole are reflected as revenues.\nOther Energy Services Revenue. Revenue from our other energy services is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Advance deposits on rooms and special events are deferred until services are provided to the customer.\nRevenues arising from claims for amounts billed in excess of the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract are recognized when billed less any allowance for uncollectibility. Revenue from such claims is only recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue, the costs for the additional services have been incurred, management believes there is a legal basis for the claim and the amount can be reliably estimated. Revenues from such claims are recorded only to the extent that contract costs relating to the claims have been incurred. Historically, we have not billed any customer for amounts not included in the original contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from contract billing or payment schedules, resulting in revenues that have been earned but not billed ( unbilled revenue\u201d) or amounts that have been billed, but not earned ( deferred revenue\u201d).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We regularly review receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established reserves, we make judgments regarding our customers' ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of customers change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. In the event we were to determine that a customer may not be able to make required payments, we would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made. Uncollectable accounts receivable are periodically charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once final determination is made of their uncollectibility.\nDepreciation and Amortization. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment, we estimate useful lives, attrition factors and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such assets is evaluated by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flow from the assets is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The impairment test is a two-step process. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the implied value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the discounted cash flow approach, excluding interest. The impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied value.\nShare-based Compensation. The share-based compensation program consists of restricted stock units granted to employees and restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors under the Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. 2016 Incentive Plan (the \"2016 Plan\"). The Company recognizes in its financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for restricted stock based on the fair value of the equity instruments as of the grant date. In general, this value is amortized over the vesting period; for grants with a non-substantive service condition, this value is recognized immediately. Amounts are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Prior to our IPO, the Partnership and each of its subsidiaries, except Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., which we refer to as Lodging, was treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. Accordingly, income taxes on net earnings were payable by the stockholders, members or partners and are not reflected in the historical financial statements. In connection with our IPO, we became a C corporation subject to federal income taxes, which triggered the recognition of federal income tax liabilities associated with historical earnings. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information. Lodging is subject to corporate income taxes and they are provided in the financial statements based upon Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standard Codification 740 Income Taxes. As such, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or (\"FASB\"), issued Accounting Standards Update, or (\"ASU\"), No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes,\" which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The effect of the adoption is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which changes inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method (for example, inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, it requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. The ASU was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, using either a full or a modified retrospective application approach; however, in July 2015 the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year (until 2018) by issuing ASU No. 2015-14, \"Revenue From Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date.\" The Company expects to adopt this new revenue guidance utilizing the retrospective method of adoption in the first quarter of 2018, and because the Company is still evaluating the portion of its revenues that may be subject to the new leasing guidance discussed below, it is unable to quantify the impact that the new revenue standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No, 2016-2 Leases\u201d amending the current accounting for leases. Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments for all leases with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less. All other leases will fall into one of two categories: (i) a financing lease or (ii) an operating lease. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. For sale leaseback transactions, a sale will only be recognized if the criteria in the new revenue recognition standard are met. ASU 2016-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Since a portion of the Company's revenue may be subject to this new leasing guidance, it expects to adopt this updated leasing guidance at the same time its adopts the new revenue standard discussed above, utilizing the retrospective method of adoption. This new leasing guidance will also impact the Company in situations where it is the lessee, and in certain circumstances it will have a right-of-use asset and lease liability on its consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\u201d and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated, growth-oriented oilfield service company serving companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing services. Our well services division provides pressure control services, flowback services and equipment rentals. Our natural sand proppant services division sells, distributes and is capable of producing proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling. Our other energy services division currently provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of completion and production and drilling related services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.\nOn October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TUSK.\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d or like terms, when used in a historical context for periods prior to October 12, 2016 refer to the Partnership and its subsidiaries. References in this report to we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d or like terms, when used in the present tense or for periods commencing on or after October 12, 2016 refer to Mammoth Inc. and its subsidiaries. Mammoth Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the completion of the IPO and the contribution described below completed on October 12, 2016 immediately prior to the IPO. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nOn November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Company their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Lodging. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to us in exchange for shares of our common stock, and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nEach year, we evaluate qualitative and quantitative aspects of our service lines. As a result of that review as of December 31, 2016, we have split our completion and production division into pressure pumping services and well services. In addition, we renamed our remote accommodation services as other energy services. As a result, we now manage our business through five operating divisions: pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract and directional drilling services and other energy services.\nSince the dates presented below, we have conducted our operations through the following entities:\nPressure Pumping Services Division\n \u2022 Pressure Pumping-March 2012 \n \u2022 Logistics-November 2012 \n \u2022 Barracuda-October 2014 \n \u2022 Pumpdown-January 2015 \n \u2022 Mr. Inspections-January 2015 \n \u2022 Silverback-June 2016 \n \u2022 Mammoth Equipment Leasing-November 2016 \nWell Services Division\n \u2022 Redback Energy Services-October 2011 \n \u2022 Redback Coil Tubing-May 2012 \n \u2022 Mammoth Energy Services-June 2016 \nNatural Sand Proppant Services Division\n \u2022 Muskie Proppant-September 2011 \nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services Division\n \u2022 Bison Drilling-November 2010 \n \u2022 Panther Drilling-December 2012 \n \u2022 Bison Trucking-August 2013 \n \u2022 White Wing-September 2014 \nOther Energy Services Division\n \u2022 Sand Tiger-October 2007 \nIndustry Overview\nThe oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 continued into February 2016, when the closing price of oil reached a 12-year low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. The low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our products and services.\nThe reduction in demand during the first part of 2016, and the resulting oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, substantially reduced the prices we could charge our customers for our products and services, and had a negative impact on the utilization of our services. This overall trend with respect to our customers' activities and spending continued in 2016. However, oil prices have increased since the 12-year low recorded on February 11, 2016, reaching a high of $54.06 per barrel on December 28, 2016. As commodity prices have begun to recover, we have experienced an increase in activity. If near term commodity prices stabilize at current levels and recover further, we expect to continue to experience an increase in demand for our services and products, particularly in our completion and production, natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling businesses. Our other energy services revenue, which are currently only attributable to our remote accommodations business, remained stable through the fourth quarter of 2016. However, we currently project that our other energy services revenues will decrease in the first quarter of 2017 if we are unable to replace one customer that represented approximately 85% of such services during the year ended December 31, 2016 when it completes the construction phase of its project, which is currently estimated to occur in early 2017.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\nRevenue. Revenue for 2016 decreased $128.9 million, or 36%, to $231.0 million from $359.9 million for 2015. Revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue decreased $45.7 million, or 27%, to $124.3 million for 2016 from $170.0 million for 2015. The decrease in our pressure pumping services revenue was driven primarily by a decline in fleet utilization from 63%, on three active fleets, for 2015 to 50%, on two active fleets, for 2016. The division decreases also included decreases due to the suspension of our pump down services in the Woodford Shale during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division revenue decreased $18.9 million, or 65%, to $10.0 million for 2016 from $28.8 million for 2015. Our coil tubing division revenue declined as a result of a decrease in average day rates from approximately $25,000 for 2015 to approximately $19,000 for 2016. Our flowback services declined as a result of discontinuing our flowback operations in the Appalachian Basin in December 2015 combined with a decline in both pricing and utilization of such services in our other basins.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue decreased $19.0 million, or 36%, to $33.8 million for 2016, from $52.8 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average sales price per ton of sand from $103 in 2015 to $59 in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tons of sand sold from approximately 512,700 for 2015 to approximately 575,400 in 2016.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division revenue decreased $41.0 million, or 56%, from $73.0 million for 2015 to $32.0 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to our land drilling services, which accounted for $35.0 million, or 86%, of the operating division decrease. The decrease in our land drilling services was driven by a decline in average active rigs from ten for 2015 to four for 2016 as well as a decline in average day rates from approximately $17,900 to approximately $12,900 during those same years. Our directional drilling services accounted for $4.3 million, or 10%, of the operating division decrease as a result of utilization declining from 36% for 2015 to 22% for 2016. Our rig moving services accounted for $1.2 million, or 3%, of the operating division decrease primarily driven by the decline in drilling activity. Our drill pipe inspection services accounted for $0.5 million, or 1%, of the operating division decrease as a result of of this business line being discontinued in the second quarter of 2016.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division revenue, consisting of revenue derived from our remote accommodations business, decreased $4.4 million, or 13%, to $30.9 million for 2016 from $35.3 million for 2015. The decrease was a result of a decrease in revenue per room night, in Canadian dollars, from $180 for 2015 to $177 for 2016. Additionally, total room nights rented decreased from 251,233 for 2015 to 230,530 for 2016.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $102.8 million from $276.3 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2015 to $173.5 million, or 75% of total revenue, for 2016. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue decreased $44.9 million, or 34%, from $131.7 million for 2015 to $86.8 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in proppant costs, repairs and maintenance expense and labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenue, our pressure pumping services division cost of revenue was 70% and 77% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance expense and a decrease in stages completed to 2,442 from 2,963 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWell Services. Well services division cost of revenue decreased $14.6 million, or 52%, from $28.1 million for 2015 to $13.5 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to declines in labor-related costs and repairs and maintenance expense. As a percentage of revenue, our well services division cost of revenue was 135% and 98% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due increased pricing pressure.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division cost of revenue decreased $15.7 million, or 36%, from $43.9 million for 2015 to $28.2 million for 2016, primarily due to a decrease in product costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 83% for each of 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue decreased $25.7 million, or 45%, from $57.5 million for 2015 to $31.8 million for 2016, primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs and lower utilization. As a percentage of revenue, our contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue was 99% and 79% for 2016 and 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance and compensation as a percentage of revenue.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division cost of revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 13%, from $15.1 million for 2015 to $13.2 million for 2016, primarily due to declines in contracted labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 43% for each of 2016 and 2015. Average revenue per room night, in Canadian dollars, decreased from $180 for 2015 to $177 for 2016. Additionally, total room nights rented decreased from 251,233 for 2015 to 230,530 for 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses decreased $3.8 million, or 19%, to $16.7 million for 2016, from $20.5 million for 2015. The decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a $2.5 million reduction in bad debt expense, a $0.3 million reduction in compensation and benefits and reductions in travel-related charges and office and computer support expense of $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for 2016 compared to 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.5 million, or 3%, to $69.9 million for 2016 from $72.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to $26.2 million of assets that fully depreciated during 2016 in addition to impairments of $10.2 million in fixed assets during 2015 and was partially offset by placing in-service of $6.6 million of capital additions.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets in 2016 of $1.9 million, which was attributable to various fixed assets. Impairments for 2015 were $12.1 million, of which $10.2 million was attributable to various fixed assets and $1.9 million was attributable to the termination of a long-term contract.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 30%, to $3.7 million during 2016 compared to $5.2 million during 2015. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in average borrowings during 2016 and the repayment of all outstanding borrowings in October 2016 with a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other income, net, of $0.2 million for 2016 compared to other expense, net of $2.2 million for 2015. The 2016 amount included $0.7 million of gain recognition on assets disposed during the period compared to a $1.4 million loss for 2015.\nIncome Taxes. In 2015, we were treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. The income tax expense recognized was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Lodging, which provides our accommodation services in our other energy services division. For 2016, we recognized income tax expense of $53.9 million compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2015. In 2016, in connection with the IPO, we became subject to federal income taxes which triggered recognition of federal income tax liabilities associated with historical earnings (See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information). The 2016 amount included recognition of other items related to the change in classification to a C corporation resulting in total one-time effect of $53.1 million. The 2015 amount included recognition of deferred taxes recorded on income from Lodging in the U.S. related to an entity election that required us to disregard previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. We made an election on entity status in September 2015 that allowed the reversal of the deferred taxes in 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nRevenue. Revenue for 2015 increased $100.4 million, or 39%, to $359.9 million from $259.5 million for 2014. The net increase in revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division revenue increased $145.2 million, or 585%, to $170.0 million for 2015 from $24.8 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to our pressure pumping services, which were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Pressure Pumping in November 2014 and accounted for substantially all of the division increase in revenue. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in our pump down services primarily driven by a decline in utilization which saw a drop in utilization from 51% for 2014 to 21% for 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division revenue decreased $16.4 million, or 36%, to $28.8 million for 2015 from $45.2 million for 2014. The decreases in revenue from both our coil tubing and flowback services, which decreased $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Our coil tubing division revenue declined as a result of a decline in demand for these services. Our flowback services revenue declined as a result of as a result of discontinuing our flowback operations in the Appalachian Basin in December 2015 combined with a decline in both pricing and utilization of such services in our other basins.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services division revenue increased $6.5 million, or 14%, to $52.8 million for 2015, from $46.3 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our pressure pumping services.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division revenue decreased $49.2 million, or 40%, to $73.0 million for 2015, from $122.2 million for 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in drilling services revenue of $41.4 million, or 84% of the net division decrease in revenue. The decrease in drilling services revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in average active rigs from 12 in 2014 to eight in 2015 as well as a decline in average day rates from $18,900 to $17,900 during those same years. For 2015, our directional drilling services division saw a reduction of $8.1 million, or 17%, of the net division decrease in revenue. Our rig moving and drill pipe inspection service lines saw a combined increase in revenue of $0.3 million, or 1%, of the net decrease in revenue primarily driven by a full year of revenue from our drill pipe inspection service line, which began operations in September 2014.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division revenue increased $14.3 million, or 68%, to $35.3 million for 2015 from $21.0 million for 2014. The increase was a result of increased occupancy resulting from the expansion of camp capacity from 498 to 884 rooms in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as an increase in room nights from 115,258 in 2014 to 251,233 in 2015. While the room nights increased, average revenue per room night declined from $206 in 2014 to $180 in 2015.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue increased $85.2 million, or 31%, from $191.1 million, or 74% of total revenue, for 2014 to $276.3 million, or 77% of total revenue, for 2015. Cost of revenue by operating division was as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services. Pressure pumping services division cost of revenue increased $114.4 million, or 661%, from $17.3 million for 2014 to $131.7 million for 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Pressure Pumping in November 2014. The increase in cost of revenue associated with our pressure pumping services accounted for $111.1 million, or 97%, of the increase. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 77% and 71% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization in our pump down services from 51% for 2014 to 21% for 2015.\nWell Services. Well services division cost of revenue decreased $3.6 million, or 11%, from $31.7 million for 2014 to $28.1 million for 2015, primarily due a decline in demand for both our coil tubing and flowback services. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 98% and 70% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased pricing pressures from our customers on the costs for these services.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services. Natural sand proppant services cost of revenue increased $5.1 million, or 13%, from $38.8 million for 2014 to $43.9 million for 2015, primarily due to an increase in our pressure pumping services. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 83% and 84% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of labor-related costs.\nContract Land and Directional / Drilling Services. Contract land and directional drilling services division cost of revenue decreased $36.1 million, or 39%, from $93.6 million for 2014 to $57.5 million for 2015, primarily due to a decrease in labor-related costs and a decline in average active rigs from 12 in 2014 to eight in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, drilling cost of revenue was 79% and 77% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased competition for our services, which resulted in a decline in average day rates from $18,900 to $17,900 during the same periods.\nOther Energy Services. Other energy services division cost of revenue increased $5.4 million, or 56%, from $9.7 million for 2014 to $15.1 million for 2015, primarily due to increases in contracted labor-related costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 43% and 46% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to the increase in division revenue in 2015 associated with an increase in room nights from 115,258 in 2014 to 251,233 in 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses represent the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations. These expenses increased $3.5 million, or 21%, to $20.5 million for 2015, from $17.0 million for 2014. The increase in expenses was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $36.8 million, or 103%, to $72.4 million for 2015 from $35.6 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the $101.5 million in property, plant and equipment and $40.7 million in amortizing intangible assets that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC and Stingray Logistics LLC on November 24, 2014. The remainder of the year-over-year increase was\nattributable to the $111.7 million in property, plant and equipment purchased in 2014 and $26.3 million in property, plant and equipment purchased in 2015.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets in 2015 of $12.1 million, of which $10.2 million was attributable to various fixed assets and $1.9 million was attributable to the termination of a long-term contract. No impairment of long-lived assets was recorded by us in 2014.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense increased $0.6 million, or 13%, to $5.2 million for 2015, compared to $4.6 million for 2014. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increased average borrowings during 2015 due primarily to $49.8 million in debt that was assumed in our acquisition of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC and Stingray Logistics LLC on November 24, 2014. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by the repayment of $70.4 million in debt during 2015.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Non-operating charges resulted in other expense, net of $2.2 million for 2015 compared to other expense, net of $5.7 million for 2014. The 2015 amount consisted primarily of the loss on disposal of long-lived assets, compared to 2014 which included charges associated with a then proposed initial public offering that was postponed due to market conditions existing at that time.\nIncome Taxes. During 2015 and 2014, we were treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. The income tax expense recognized was primarily attributable to our subsidiary, Lodging, which provides our accommodation services. For 2015, we recognized income tax benefit of $1.6 million compared to an income tax expense of $7.5 million for 2014. The change was primarily attributable to deferred taxes recorded on income from Lodging in the U.S. for 2014 related to an entity election that required us to disregard previously recorded deferred tax liability. We made an election on entity status in September 2015 that allowed the reversal of the deferred taxes in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, one-time compensation charges associated with the IPO, equity based compensation, interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets and charges associated with the Partnership's proposed initial public offering in 2014) and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables also provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income or (loss) for each of our operating segments for the specified periods.\nConsolidated\n\nPressure Pumping Services\n\nWell Services\n\nNatural Sand Proppant Services\n\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services\n\nOther Energy Services\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund ongoing operations, including maintenance expenditures on our existing fleet and equipment, organic growth initiatives, investments and acquisitions. Since November 2014, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations in addition to our proceeds from our initial public offering. Our primary use of capital has been for investing in property and equipment used to provide our services.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our revolving credit facility was undrawn, leaving an aggregate of $146.2 million, of available borrowing capacity under this facility.\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity as of the dates indicated:\n\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.1 million, $68.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the decrease in net income. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to positive operating income generated by our pressure pumping services as well as cash generated by working capital changes. The cash generated from working capital changes was primarily attributable to the collection of receivables.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million, $24.8 million and $101.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Substantially all cash used in investing activities was used to purchase property and equipment that is utilized to provide our services.\nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures by operating division for the periods indicated:\n\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4.7 million, $(55.9) million and $103.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net repayments of $98.4 million under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of $103.1 million from the IPO. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net borrowings of $53.7 million and capital contributions of $51.8 million partially offset by $2.4 million in debt issuance costs.\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rate on Cash\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate on cash was $0.1 million, $(0.3) million and $(2.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year effect was driven primarily by a favorable (unfavorable) shift in the weakness (strength) of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for the cash held in Canadian accounts.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital totaled $57.0 million and $25.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our cash balances totaled $28.7 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 25, 2014, we entered into a $170.0 million revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Capital Markets LLC, as lead arranger, PNC Bank, National Association, as the administrative and collateral agent, and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto. Our revolving credit facility, as amended in connection with the IPO, matures on November 25, 2019. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are secured by our and our subsidiaries' assets. The maximum availability for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation prepared monthly. Concurrent with our entry into our revolving credit facility, we repaid all of our then existing subordinate debt with the initial advance under our revolving credit facility.\nInterest is payable monthly at a base rate set by the institution's commercial lending group plus an applicable margin. Additionally, at our request, outstanding balances, are permitted to be converted to LIBOR rate plus applicable margin tranches at set increments of $500,000. The LIBOR rate option allows us to select interest periods from one, two, and three or six months. The applicable margin for either the base rate or the LIBOR rate option can vary from 1.5% to 3.0%, based upon a calculation of the excess availability of the line as a percentage of the maximum credit limit.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and at February 21, 2017 our credit facility remained undrawn with availability of $142.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit.\nOur revolving credit facility contains various customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. Among the covenants are two financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio (3.0 to 1.0), and a maximum leverage ratio (4.0 to 1.0), and minimum availability ($10.0 million). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nAs a result of the decline in drilling and completion activity, we reduced our capital expenditures in 2015 and have further reduced our capital expenditures in 2016. During 2016, our capital expenditures included $7.7 million on our pressure pumping services division primarily for pressure pumping equipment, $2.7 million in our contract land and directional drilling services division primarily for upgrades to our rig fleet, $0.4 million in our other energy services division primarily for an intersection upgrade, $0.4 million in our well services division primarily for upgrades on a coil tubing unit and $0.1 million in our natural sand proppant services division for a conveyor.\nWith commodity prices beginning to increase in the second half of 2016 and then stabilizing at their current range, we have seen an increase in customer demand, particularly in our pressure pumping and natural sand proppant services divisions. We have increased our capital budget accordingly and, during 2017, we currently estimate that our aggregate capital expenditures will be approximately $120.0 million. These capital expenditures include $66.0 million in our pressure pumping services division for the acquisition of an additional 132,500 horsepower of new high pressure hydraulic pumps and related equipment, $29.0 million in our pressure pumping service division for tractors, pneumatic trailers and transload facilities to enhance our last mile solutions, $9.0 million in our contract land and directional drilling services division for an upgrade to two of our horizontal rigs and $16.0 million in our well services and other energy services divisions, primarily to maintain our coil tubing and flowback services lines and add new service offerings.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, and significant additional capital expenditures could be required to conduct our operations. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, as previously announced, we intend to actively pursue an acquisition strategy to enhance our portfolio of products and services, market positioning and/or geographic presence. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, and the number of opportunities coming to our attention has increased substantially since the IPO. We do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2017 since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted, however, we continue to evaluate opportunities, including transactions involving entities controlled by Wexford and Gulfport. Our acquisitions may be undertaken with cash, our common stock or a combination of cash, common stock and/or other consideration. In the event we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital for that or other reasons, we may do so through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, joint venture partnerships, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that this additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funds we need, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) The long-term debt excludes interest payments on each obligation. \n (2) Assumption of no long-term debt balance; future charges relate to commitment fees on credit facility. \n (3) Operating lease obligations relate to real estate, rail cars and other equipment. \n (4) The purchase commitment to a sand supplier represents our annual obligation to purchase a minimum amount of sand. \n (5) Obligations arising from capital improvements/equipment purchases. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases real estate, rail cars and other equipment under long-term operating leases with varying terms and expiration dates through 2025. Aggregate future minimum lease payments under these non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2016 are as follows:\n\nOther Commitments\nWe entered into a purchase agreement in 2014 with a sand supplier to begin January 1, 2015 and end December 31, 2016. We are subject to an annual commitment of 200,000 tons of sand. During June 2016, we paid a deposit of $0.6 million to the sand supplier to be netted against future purchases of sand under this contract and deferred the commitment until 2017. We have one additional unilateral option to extend for one additional year with a further deposit of $0.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, the future commitment for 2017 under this agreement was $2.2 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire new high pressure fracturing units and other capital equipment. The future commitments under these agreements was $18.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Subsequently, in February 2017, we ordered additional new high pressure fracturing units with nameplate capacity of 57,500 horsepower and related equipment. The aggregate cost of the February 2017 commitments was $35.2 million. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2016, we ordered $6.4 million in other equipment for our natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling service segments.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we entered into railcar lease agreements with aggregate commitments of $2.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. See Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nUse of Estimates. In preparing the financial statements, our management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for self-insurance, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and future cash flows and fair values used to assess recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenue from multiple sources within our five operating divisions. In all cases, revenue is recognized when services are performed, collection of the receivables is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable. Services are sold without warranty or the right to return. Taxes assessed on revenue transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in revenue. The specific revenue sources are outlined as follows:\nPressure Pumping Services Revenue. Pressure pumping services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each day's work based upon a completed field ticket, which includes the charges for the services performed, mobilization of the equipment to the location and the personnel involved in such services or mobilization. Additional revenue is generated through labor charges and the sale of consumable supplies that are incidental to the service being performed. The labor charges and the use of consumable supplies are reflected on completed field tickets.\nWell Services Revenue. Well services are typically provided based upon a purchase order, contract, or on a spot market basis. Services are provided on a day rate, contracted, or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Our equipment rental services are recognized upon completion of each day's work based on completed field ticket.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services Revenue. Revenue from the sale of natural sand proppant is recognized according to the terms of title transfer on the sand. For proppant sold free on board plant, revenue is recognized when the sand is shipped. For proppant sold free on board destination, revenue is recognized when the sand reaches the customer specified transload facility or when the sand is loaded into a truck for last mile delivery depending on the specific terms of each sale.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services Revenue. Contract drilling services are provided under daywork or footage contracts, and revenue is recognized as the work progresses based on the days completed or the feet drilled, as applicable. Mobilization revenue and costs for daywork and footage contracts are recognized over the days of actual drilling. Directional drilling services are provided on a day rate or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as work progresses. Proceeds from customers for the cost of oilfield downhole rental equipment that is involuntarily damaged or lost in-hole are reflected as revenues.\nOther Energy Services Revenue. Revenue from our other energy services is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Advance deposits on rooms and special events are deferred until services are provided to the customer.\nRevenues arising from claims for amounts billed in excess of the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract are recognized when billed less any allowance for uncollectibility. Revenue from such claims is only recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue, the costs for the additional services have been incurred, management believes there is a legal basis for the claim and the amount can be reliably estimated. Revenues from such claims are recorded only to the extent that contract costs relating to the claims have been incurred. Historically, we have not billed any customer for amounts not included in the original contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from contract billing or payment schedules, resulting in revenues that have been earned but not billed ( unbilled revenue\u201d) or amounts that have been billed, but not earned ( deferred revenue\u201d).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We regularly review receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established reserves, we make judgments regarding our customers' ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of customers change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. In the event we were to determine that a customer may not be able to make required payments, we would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made. Uncollectable accounts receivable are periodically charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once final determination is made of their uncollectibility.\nDepreciation and Amortization. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment, we estimate useful lives, attrition factors and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such assets is evaluated by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flow from the assets is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The impairment test is a two-step process. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. If impairment is indicated, then the implied value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the discounted cash flow approach, excluding interest. The impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied value.\nShare-based Compensation. The share-based compensation program consists of restricted stock units granted to employees and restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors under the Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. 2016 Incentive Plan (the \"2016 Plan\"). The Company recognizes in its financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for restricted stock based on the fair value of the equity instruments as of the grant date. In general, this value is amortized over the vesting period; for grants with a non-substantive service condition, this value is recognized immediately. Amounts are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Prior to our IPO, the Partnership and each of its subsidiaries, except Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., which we refer to as Lodging, was treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax and most state income tax purposes. Accordingly, income taxes on net earnings were payable by the stockholders, members or partners and are not reflected in the historical financial statements. In connection with our IPO, we became a C corporation subject to federal income taxes, which triggered the recognition of federal income tax liabilities associated with historical earnings. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information. Lodging is subject to corporate income taxes and they are provided in the financial statements based upon Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standard Codification 740 Income Taxes. As such, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or (\"FASB\"), issued Accounting Standards Update, or (\"ASU\"), No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes,\" which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The effect of the adoption is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which changes inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method (for example, inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, it requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. The ASU was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, using either a full or a modified retrospective application approach; however, in July 2015 the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year (until 2018) by issuing ASU No. 2015-14, \"Revenue From Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date.\" The Company expects to adopt this new revenue guidance utilizing the retrospective method of adoption in the first quarter of 2018, and because the Company is still evaluating the portion of its revenues that may be subject to the new leasing guidance discussed below, it is unable to quantify the impact that the new revenue standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No, 2016-2 Leases\u201d amending the current accounting for leases. Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments for all leases with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less. All other leases will fall into one of two categories: (i) a financing lease or (ii) an operating lease. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. For sale leaseback transactions, a sale will only be recognized if the criteria in the new revenue recognition standard are met. ASU 2016-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Since a portion of the Company's revenue may be subject to this new leasing guidance, it expects to adopt this updated leasing guidance at the same time its adopts the new revenue standard discussed above, utilizing the retrospective method of adoption. This new leasing guidance will also impact the Company in situations where it is the lessee, and in certain circumstances it will have a right-of-use asset and lease liability on its consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 180: <table><tr><td> </td>

across 5 divisions: pressure pumping, well services, natural sand proppant, contract land/directional drilling, and other energy services.\n\n- In Oct 2016, Mammoth completed its IPO, selling shares to the public and becoming a public C corporation. \n\nResults of Operations\n- Revenue decreased 36% from 2015 to 2016, driven by declines across all divisions due to lower oil/gas drilling and completion activity. Net loss was $88.4 million in 2016 compared to $27.2 million in 2015.\n\n- Revenue increased 39% from 2014 to 2015, driven by growth in the pressure pumping division from an acquisition. Net loss was $27.2 million in 2015 versus $2 million in 2014.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- As of Dec 2016, Mammoth had $28.7 million of cash, $146 million of revolver availability, and working capital of $57 million. This gives good liquidity.\n\n- Capital expenditures declined from $26 million in 2015 to $11 million in 2016 as activity slowed. Mammoth plans $120 million of capex in 2017 with an industry recovery.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, amortization, impairments, revenue recognition, and income taxes. \n\n- Effective in 2016, Mammoth became a C corporation and accrued one-time charges of $53 million for federal income taxes on historical earnings."}
