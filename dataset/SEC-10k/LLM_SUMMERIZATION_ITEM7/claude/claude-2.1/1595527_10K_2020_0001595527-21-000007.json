Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed REIT that invests primarily in office properties located exclusively within the five boroughs of New York City, primarily Manhattan. We have also purchased certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, and may purchase hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types also located exclusively within the five boroughs of New York City. As of December 31, 2020, we owned eight properties consisting of 1,163,061 rentable square feet acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $790.7 million.\nOn August 18, 2020, we listed shares of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. In anticipation of the listing, we implemented a series of corporate actions which resulted in the bifurcation of our common stock into Class A common stock and Class B common stock in a net reduction of 2.43 shares for every one share of common stock outstanding prior to these corporate actions, which we refer to as the Reverse Stock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts as of dates prior to August 5, 2020 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on that date. To effect the listing, and to address the potential for selling pressure that may have existed at the outset of listing, we listed only shares of Class A common stock, which represented approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock, on the NYSE when trading commenced. Our other class of outstanding stock is Class B common stock, which comprised approximately 75% of our outstanding shares of common stock at that time. The first of three equal tranches of shares of Class B common stock that were not listed on the NYSE on the listing date converted into 3,189,204 shares of Class A common stock and the shares were listed on the NYSE on December 16, 2020. Following a determination by our board of directors, the second tranche of shares of Class B common stock converted into 3,176,127 shares of Class A common stock and were listed on the NYSE on March 1, 2021. The remaining tranche of shares of Class B common stock will convert into shares of Class A common stock to be listed on the NYSE on August 13, 2021, unless earlier converted. For additional information, see Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through the OP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our Advisor manages our day-to-day business with the assistance of our Property Manager. Our Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to us. We also reimburse these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to us.\nManagement Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has created several risks and uncertainties that may impact our business, including our future results of operations and our liquidity. A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19 affecting New York City, where we and our tenants operate could have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The ultimate impact on our results of operations, our liquidity and the ability of our tenants to continue to pay us rent will depend on numerous factors including the overall length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management is unable to predict the nature and scope of any of these factors. These factors include the following, among others:\n\u2022The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all. However, we have taken proactive steps with regard to rent collections to mitigate the impact on our business (see -Management Actions\u201d below). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced several lease expirations without renewals as well as terminations, including four during the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, one of our tenants, Knotel, declared bankruptcy in early 2021. Management has already re-leased a portion of the vacant space and is working on securing additional new leases, although there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022There may be a decline in the demand for tenants to lease real estate, as well as a negative impact on rental rates. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio had an occupancy level of 87.0% (80.8% giving effect to the termination of all Knotel's leases with us in January 2021), the weighted-average remaining term of our leases was 7.2 (based on annualized straight-line rent).\n\u2022New York City, where all of our properties are located, has been among the hardest hit locations in the country and until it began its phased reopening in June 2020, which is still underway as of December 31, 2020, operated under a mandatory order under which tenants were required to cease all non-essential in-office functions. Certain restrictions\nhave since been imposed, and there may be further restrictions in the future. Our properties remain accessible to all tenants, although, even as operating restrictions expire, not all tenants have resumed operations. In addition, as New York's phased opening continues, and occupants continue to return to our properties, operating costs may begin to rise, including for services, labor and personal protective equipment and other supplies, as our property managers take appropriate actions to protect tenants and property management personnel. Some of these costs may be recoverable through reimbursement from tenants but others will be borne by us. However, despite the current restrictions and continued reopening, we expect that the mass vaccine rollout will target a return to normalcy\u201d after the summer holidays and will support an uptick in office usage and leasing trends by the end of 2021 and through 2022.\n\u2022Capital market volatility and a tightening of credit standards could negatively impact our ability to obtain debt financing. We do not have any significant debt principal repayments due until 2024.\n\u2022The negative impact of the pandemic on our results of operations and cash flows has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to comply with covenants in our loans. The impact of COVID-19 on our tenants led to early lease terminations and expirations without renewals that caused cash trap events on two of our mortgages as described further in this section.\n\u2022The potential negative impact on the health of personnel of our Advisor, particularly if a significant number of the Advisor's employees are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity.\nFor additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions and may worsen\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Advisor has responded to the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in early March 2020, the Advisor took proactive steps to prepare for and actively mitigate the inevitable disruption COVID-19 would cause, such as, enacting safety measures, both required or recommended by relevant government authorities, including remote working policies, cooperation with localized closure or curfew directives, and social distancing measures at all of our properties. Additionally, there has been no material adverse impact on our financial reporting systems or internal controls and procedures and the Advisor's ability to perform services for us. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are supplementing the historical discussion of our results of operations for the year ended 2020 with a current update on the measures we have taken to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on our business and future results of operations.\nManagement's Actions\nWe have taken several steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business. For rent collections, we have been in direct contact with our tenants since the crisis began, continuing to cultivate open dialogue and deepen the fundamental relationships that we have carefully developed through prior transactions and historic operations. Based on this approach and the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of our tenants, we believe that we have had positive results in our cash rent collections during this pandemic.\nOur portfolio is primarily comprised of office and retail tenants with 78% and 21% of fourth quarter cash rent due from office and retail tenants, respectively. We have collected 86% of fourth quarter cash rent due from our office tenants, 64% of cash rent due from our retail tenants and 82% of cash rent due across our entire portfolio, including 89% of cash rent due from our top ten tenants (based on annualized straight-line rent as of December 31, 2020). The cash rent collected across our entire portfolio was consistent with the third quarter in which we reported total portfolio original cash rent collections of 85% due for the third quarter as of October 31, 2020, which has improved to 86% of third quarter's original cash rent collected as of March 23, 2021. We also reported total portfolio original cash rent collections of 86% due for the second quarter as of October 31, 2020, which remains unchanged as of March 23, 2021. During the fourth quarter, we concluded that it was no longer probable that we would collect substantially all of the amounts due from a number of tenants due to the on-going impacts of COVID. These included most significantly Knotel, a tenant at both our 123 William Street and 9 Times Square properties, as well as several smaller tenants. Accordingly, these tenants were placed on a cash basis and all receivables were fully reserved with additional reserves of $7.4 million ($2.9 million in contract receivables and $4.5 million in straight-line rent receivables) recorded in the fourth quarter.\nThe table below presents additional information on our fourth quarter cash rent collection status and is based on available information as of March 1, 2021.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter 2020 Cash Rent Status </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter cash rent paid (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approved agreements (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agreement negotiation (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1) Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments thereafter prior to an approved agreement.\n(2) Consists of deferral agreements as well as amendments granting the tenant a rent credit for some portion of cash rent due. The rent credit is generally coupled with an extension of the lease. The terms of the lease amendments providing for rent credits differ by tenant in terms of length and amount of the credit. A deferral agreement is an executed or approved amendment to an existing lease to defer a certain portion of cash rent due. The most common arrangements represent deferral of some or all of the rent due for the second or third quarter of 2020 with such amounts to be paid in 2021.\n(3) Represents active tenant discussions where no approved agreement has yet been reached. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful and will lead to formal agreements on favorable terms, or at all. These amounts are substantially comprised of tenants that were placed on a cash basis, including Knotel which represents 6% of fourth quarter cash rent due, after concluding that it was no longer probable that substantially all amounts due would be collected. We have fully reserved for amounts due from these tenants as a reduction in revenue as of December 31, 2020.\n(4) Consists of tenants who have made a partial payment and/or tenants without active communication on a potential approved agreement. There can be no assurance that such cash rent will be collected. Includes approximately 0.25% of fourth quarter cash rent due from a tenant that was placed on cash basis during the fourth quarter for which we have fully reserved as a reduction in revenue as of December 31, 2020.\nThrough March 23, 2021, we had collected 82% of January 2021 cash rent due and 86% of February 2021 cash rent due (with the increase in February partially due to the fact that Knotel is not included in our rent collection data after January 31, 2021 when all of their leases with us terminated). Fourth quarter rent collections were particularly impacted by the Knotel bankruptcy and a lease amendment with one of our tenants that granted a rent credit of $0.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 in exchange for a 24-month lease extension. Moreover, certain tenants that have entered into agreements with us with respect to second, third or fourth quarter rents have, following the expiration of those agreements, sought to enter into new agreements further deferring or abating rent for additional periods. There can be no assurance additional tenants will not similarly seek future rent relief or that we will be able to collect the cash rent that is due in future months including the deferred 2020 rent amounts due during 2021 under deferral agreements we have entered into with our tenants. Through March 23, 2021, we had collected 25% of January 2021 cash rent due that represented 2020 cash rent that had been deferred until 2021 and 32% of February 2021 cash rent due that represented 2020 cash rent that had been deferred until 2021. We expect this trend of lower collections of amounts previously deferred may continue in future months in 2021. We expect our cash rent collections will stay at current levels and could potentially decline until the New York City economy reopens and recovers sufficiently for our tenants ability to pay rent to improve, although there can be no assurance how long this will take. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the amount of cash rent that we collect going forward cannot be determined at present.\nWe have entered into 18 approved agreements with 11 different tenants that commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020. Under approved agreements entered into during 2020, the total amount deferred was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Under approved agreements entered into during 2020, the total amounts of rent credits (i.e. abatements) was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the critical accounting policies that management believes is important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:\nImpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAs discussed above, we have taken a proactive approach to achieve mutually agreeable solutions with tenants impacted by COVID-19 and in some cases, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, we executed different types of lease amendments. These agreements include deferrals and abatements and also may include extensions to the term of the leases.\nFor accounting purposes, in accordance with ASC 842: Leases, normally a company would be required to assess a lease modification to determine if the lease modification should be treated as a separate lease and if not, modification accounting would be applied which would require a company to reassess the classification of the lease (including leases for which the prior classification under ASC 840 was retained as part of the election to apply the package of practical expedients allowed upon the adoption of ASC 842, which does not apply to leases subsequently modified). However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in\nwhich many leases are being modified, the FASB and SEC have provided relief that allows companies to make a policy election as to whether they treat COVID-19 related lease amendments as a provision included in the pre-concession arrangement, and therefore, not a lease modification, or to treat the lease amendment as a modification. In order to be considered COVID-19 related, cash flows must be substantially the same or less than those prior to the concession. For COVID-19 relief qualified changes, there are two methods to potentially account for such rent deferrals or abatements under the relief, (1) as if the changes were originally contemplated in the lease contract or (2) as if the deferred payments are variable lease payments contained in the lease contract. For all other lease changes that did not qualify for FASB relief, we would be required to apply modification accounting including assessing classification under ASC 842.\nSome, but not all of our lease modifications qualify for the FASB relief. In accordance with the relief provisions, instead of treating these qualifying leases as modifications, we have elected to treat the modifications as if previously contained in the lease and recast rents receivable prospectively (if necessary). Under that accounting, for modifications that were deferrals only, there would be no impact on overall rental revenue and for any abatement amounts that reduced total rent to be received, the impact would be recognized ratably over the remaining life of the lease.\nFor leases not qualifying for this relief, we applied modification accounting and determined that there were no changes in the current classification of its leases impacted by negotiations with its tenants.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue from tenants, which are derived primarily from lease contracts, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. As of December 31, 2020, these leases had an average remaining lease term of 7.2 years. Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires that we record a receivable for, and include in revenue from tenants, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease modification is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. Pursuant to certain of our lease agreements, tenants are required to reimburse us for certain property operating expenses (recorded in total revenue from tenants), in addition to paying base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties. Under ASC 842, we have elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line Revenue from tenants\u201d. For comparative purposes, we have also elected to reflect prior revenue and reimbursements reported under ASC 842 on a single line. For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under both ASC 842 and 840, we have reflected them on a net basis.\nIncluded in revenue from tenants for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $0.1 million of tenant reimbursement related to prior year.\nWe own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets. As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income, until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in contingent rental income is included in revenue from tenants in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rents receivable and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. Under the leasing standard adopted on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion), we are required to assess, based on credit risk, if it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments at the lease commencement date and we must continue to reassess collectability periodically thereafter based on new facts and circumstances affecting the credit risk of the tenant. In fiscal 2020, this assessment has included consideration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our tenant's ability to pay rents in accordance with their contracts. Partial reserves, or the ability to assume partial recovery are no longer permitted. If we determine that it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments (base rent and additional rent), the lease will continue to be accounted for on an accrual basis (i.e., straight-line). However, if we determine that it is not probable that it will collect virtually all of the lease payments, the lease will be accounted for on a cash basis and a full reserve would be recorded on previously accrued amounts in cases where it was subsequently concluded that collection was not probable. Cost recoveries from tenants are included in revenue from tenants in accordance with current accounting rules, on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.\nIn accordance with the lease accounting rules we record uncollectable amounts as reductions in revenue from tenants. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we reduced revenue from tenants by $8.5 million for reserves recorded during the period on receivables for which the related tenants have been put on a cash basis (see accounting policy above). There were no such reductions recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nAt the time an asset is acquired, we evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of the asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. See the Purchase Price Allocation section below for a discussion of the initial accounting for investments in real estate.\nDisposal of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. No properties were presented as discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale, most significantly that the sale is probable within one year. We evaluate probability of sale based on specific facts including whether a sales agreement is in place and the buyer has made significant non-refundable deposits. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any properties held for sale.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - ASU No. 2016-02 Leases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of our leases as lessor prior to adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019 were accounted for as operating leases and we continued to account for them as operating leases under the transition guidance. We evaluate new leases originated after the adoption date (by us or by a predecessor lessor/owner) pursuant to the new guidance where a lease for some or all of a building is classified by a lessor as a sales-type lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership reside with the tenant. This situation is met if, among other things, there is an automatic transfer of title during the lease, a bargain purchase option, the non-cancelable lease term is for more than major part of remaining economic useful life of the asset (e.g., equal to or greater than 75%), if the present value of the minimum lease payments represents substantially all (e.g., equal to or greater than 90%) of the leased property's fair value at lease inception, or if the asset so specialized in nature that it provides no alternative use to the lessor (and therefore would not provide any future value to the lessor) after the lease term. Further, such new leases would be evaluated to consider whether they would be failed sale-leaseback transactions and accounted for as financing transactions by the lessor. For the three year period ended December 31, 2020, we have no leases as a lessor that would be considered as sales-type leases or financings under sale-leaseback rules.\nWe are also the lessee under a land lease which was previously classified prior to adoption of lease accounting, and will continue to be classified, as operating leases under transition elections unless subsequently modified. These leases are reflected on the balance sheet and the rent expense is reflected on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nIn both a business combination and an asset acquisition, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as if vacant basis. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below- market leases and other identifiable assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests (in a business combination) are recorded at their estimated fair values. In allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates. In a business combination, the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is either recorded as goodwill or as a bargain purchase gain. In an asset acquisition, the difference between the acquisition price (including capitalized transaction costs) and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is allocated to the non-current assets. There were no asset acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were asset acquisitions.\nFor acquired properties with leases classified as operating leases, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nTangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Fair value estimates are also made using significant assumptions such as capitalization rates, discount rates, fair market lease rates and land values per square foot.\nIdentifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates and the value of in-place leases as applicable. Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 24 months. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nAbove-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of its existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. We did not record any intangible asset amounts related to customer relationships recorded in connection with the acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nGain on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nGains on sales of rental real estate after January 1, 2018 are not considered sales to customers and will generally be recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets ( ASC 610-20\u201d).\nGain on sales of real estate prior to January 1, 2018 are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360-20, Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20\u201d). The specific timing of a sale was measured against various criteria in and ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, depending on the circumstances, we may not record a sale or it may record a sale but may defer some or all of the gain recognition. If the criteria for full accrual are not met, we may account for the transaction by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria for the full accrual method are met. We did not have any dispositions during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the property for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If an impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, we would recognize an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss recorded would equal the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net earnings. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nThe value of customer relationship intangibles, if any, is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nAssumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.\nAbove and Below-Market Lease Amortization\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of revenue from tenants over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to revenue from tenants over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. If a tenant with a below-market rent renewal does not renew any remaining unamortized amount will be taken into income at that time.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets. The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.\nWe record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply, or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. If we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any change in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

tenant improvements and leasing commissions were incurred in the period in which the lease commenced, which may be different than the period in which these amounts are actually paid. Does not include tenant improvements and leasing commissions on new leases that are not replacement leases.\nIn addition to the comparative period-over-period discussions below, please see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and management's responses.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to 2019\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned eight properties, comprising of seven properties acquired prior to January 2019 and our 196 Orchard Street property acquired in July 2019 ( 196 Orchard Street\u201d). Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflect changes due to leasing activity and the impact of our acquisition of 196 Orchard Street properties.\nRevenue from Tenants\nRevenue from tenants decreased $7.6 million to $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to reserves of $8.5 million recorded during the period on receivables ($3.0 million of accounts receivables and $5.5 million of straight-line rent receivables) for which the related tenants (including Knotel, but also certain other tenants that continue to occupy the space they have leased from us) have have been put on a cash basis or have terminated their leases early, primarily as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the reserves recorded, $7.5 million was related to receivables from tenants that were put on a cash basis in 2020 and $1.0 million was related to receivables from tenants that terminated their leases early. Of the amount that related to receivables from tenants that were put on cash basis, $1.5 million relates to straight-line rent that would have otherwise been recorded in the fourth quarter. While we have entered into short-term leases with two of Knotel's former tenants at 123 William Street that collectively represent over 23,400 square feet and we are working to find new tenants to replace Knotel and to increase the rental income at our properties through leasing activity, there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all. There was also a decrease in reimbursable operating expenses, such as utilities, due to fewer tenants working at the properties during the period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe decreases to our year-over-year revenue from tenants were partially offset by the incremental impact of a full year of revenue from tenants in 2020 from our 196 Orchard Street acquisition (acquired in July 2019) and the write-off of below-market lease intangibles in connection with leases terminated during the current year.\nAsset and Property Management Fees to Related Parties\nWe incurred $7.6 million and $7.3 million in fees for asset and property management services to our Advisor and Property Manager for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This is primarily related to the impact of property management fees due to the Property Manager that are no longer adjusted for reimbursable expenses paid by us to third-party property managers beginning on April 1, 2019. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in property management fees due to the calculation being based on cash receipts, which decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on fees incurred to our Advisor and Property Manager.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased $1.1 million to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in condominium fees and property taxes, which were previously directly paid by certain tenants that stopped paying these obligations under their leases and we expect will continue to be paid by us while these tenants are not paying rent. In addition, the increase to our property operating expenses was impacted by the incremental effect of a full year of property operating expenses in 2020 from our 196 Orchard Street acquisition (acquired in July 2019).\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nWe incurred no acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $13,000 of acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nListing Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $1.3 million of expenses associated with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE.\nVesting and Conversion of Class B Units\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash expense of $1.2 million related to the vesting and conversion of Class B Units. The vesting conditions relating to the Class B Units were fully satisfied upon completion of the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. On the listing date, 65,498 Class B Units were converted into Class A Units, of which 52,398 held by the Advisor were subsequently redeemed for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation increased $3.8 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $86,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the recording of $3.8 million of expense related to the 2020 OPP as well as amortization related to restricted shares of common stock. Approximately $0.1 million of expense was recorded for the amortization of restricted shares of common stock. See Note 11 - Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the 2020 OPP and restricted shares of common stock.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased legal and audit fees. Legal fees increased due to legal costs associated with negotiating with our tenants as a result of COVID-19 and expenses incurred associated with the tender offer for shares of Class B common stock completed in January 2021, as well as costs associated with capital-raising and other activity related to the Listing.\nTotal reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services provided by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3.6 million, of which $1.0 million related to administrative and overhead expenses and $2.6 million were for salaries, wages, and benefits. This is compared to $3.2 million of reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services for the year ended December 31, 2019. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses and reimbursements for salaries, wages, and benefits are subject to an annual limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the annual limits on reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses on and for salaries, wages, and benefit were reached. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also received a credit of $0.4 million relating to a change in estimate for previously paid 2019 bonuses. The limit on reimbursement for salaries, wages and benefits was evaluated without regard to our 2019 bonus reimbursement from the Advisor. On a combined basis, giving effect to the credit, our reimbursements to our Advisor were approximately the same year over year. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $0.5 million to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an out-of-period charge of $0.3 million in 2020 (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and due to a higher depreciable asset base as a result of the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street completed in July 2019 and the net effect of fixed and intangible asset write-offs associated with lease terminations recorded during the current year. As a result of the termination of our leases with Knotel effective January 31, 2021 following Knotel's filing for bankruptcy earlier that month, we will write-off all related intangibles, including an estimated $1.3 million of deferred leasing costs, which will be included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.9 million to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to loans we entered into in April 2019 secured by 9 Times Square and July 2019 in connection with the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street (see Note 4 - Mortgage Notes Payable, Net to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). During the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted-average outstanding debt balance was $405.0 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our weighted average outstanding debt balance was $359.9 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%.\nOther Income\nOther income remained consistent at $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Approximately $0.7 million of the other income in 2020 is related to the recognition of income from the retention of a deposit forfeited by the buyer on the potential sale of the property commonly known as the HIT Factory\u201d under a purchase agreement which expired in April 2020. This increase was partially offset by a decline in interest income on invested cash due to a decline in rates.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the restricted cash we are required to maintain, the timing of interest payments, the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.6 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of $41.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $35.3 million, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion/amortization of below market and above market lease liabilities and assets and share-based compensation, as well as the vesting and conversion of Class B Units. Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash outflows of $7.4 million for an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, $0.3 million for a net increase in straight-line receivables and $0.5 million related to a decrease related to accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with operating activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by a $0.3 million increase related to additional deferred (prepaid rent) revenue.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million which consisted of a net loss of $21.9 million, and, after adjustments for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets and other non-cash expenses of $31.0 million, resulted in cash inflows of $9.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash outflow of $1.5 million for a decrease in rent payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates and a decrease in other liabilities of $2.1 million for a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These operating cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.0 million primarily related to unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis, payment of real estate taxes and deferred leasing costs.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.8 million related to the funding of capital expenditures relating to tenant and building improvements at 9 Times Square, 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $46.0 million related to capital expenditures of $7.7 million primarily due to building and tenant improvements at 9 Times Square, 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas and $38.3 million due to the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street in July 2019.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the redemption of fractional shares of common stock of $0.3 million and restricted shares following the Reverse Stock Split that occurred on August 5, 2020 as well as dividends paid on common stock of $0.6 million in October 2020 (see Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $55.0 million, partially offset by payments of $3.9 million relating to financing costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for cash are to fund operating and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to our properties, our debt service obligations and, subject to capital availability, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $31.0 million as compared to $39.1 million as of September 30, 2020 and $51.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Under the guarantee of certain enumerated recourse liabilities of the borrower under one of our mortgage loans, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth in excess of $175.0 million and minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of $10.0 million.\nOur principal sources of cash in recent periods have been the net cash, if any, provided by our current property operations and cash on hand consisting primarily of proceeds from financings of then-unencumbered assets. In some recent periods, including the fourth quarter and full year 2020, the net cash provided by our property operations has not alone been sufficient to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all, which has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the amount of cash we receive from our operations and therefore our ability to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements, which, beginning in October 2020, include dividends to our common stockholders. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, as described in more detail below, the operating results at 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square properties were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic leading to early lease terminations and expirations without renewals that caused cash trap events under the non-recourse mortgages for those properties to be triggered. Specifically for these properties, there were early lease terminations, expirations without renewal and a tenant bankruptcy for a significant tenant in the 9 Times Square property (Knotel). As a result, at these properties, which together represent 61% of the rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, we will not be able to use excess cash flow from the properties to fund operating expenses at our other properties and other capital requirements until the breaches have been cured.\nIn addition to the discussion below, see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and management's actions taken in response. Due to rent deferrals and the other impacts of COVID-19, as well as the terms of our leases, we anticipate we may continue to fund a portion of our operating expenses and other capital requirements with cash on hand through at least the first half of 2021. We do not have any significant debt principal repayments due until 2024, and we believe that we will have sufficient cash available to us to meet our operating cash requirements over the next year. We expect to fund our future capital needs, including for acquisitions or share repurchases, if authorized, through a combination of net cash, if any, provided by our current property operations, or the operations of properties that we may acquire in the future, proceeds from property dispositions (if any) and proceeds from our Common Stock ATM Program (as defined below) or other future equity offerings and debt financings.\nMortgage Loans\nWe have six mortgage loans secured by seven of our eight properties with an aggregate balance of $405.0 million as of December 31, 2020 with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%. We do not currently have a commitment for a corporate-level revolving credit facility or any other corporate-level indebtedness, and there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain corporate-level financing on favorable terms, or at all. Our only asset that is not serving as collateral for a mortgage is 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory, which is unoccupied and therefore unlikely to be accepted as collateral for a new mortgage loan. See -Acquisitions and Dispositions\u201d section below for further detail on this property. We do not currently anticipate incurring additional indebtedness secured by our existing properties, however, despite a tightening of the credit markets, we expect to be able to continue to use debt financing as a source of capital to the extent we acquire additional properties.\nWe do not have principal payments due on our mortgage notes payable for the year ending December 31, 2021.\nWe have been in breach of a debt service coverage provision and a reserve fund reserve provision under the non-recourse mortgage loan with $99.0 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 secured by the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property for the last two quarters. These breaches are not events of default, rather they require excess cash (after payment of operating costs, debt service and capital/tenant replacement reserves) to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants for this loan may be cured after achieving two consecutive quarters when the required debt service coverage for the property is maintained, whereupon the additional collateral will be released. Currently, we have not cured the breaches through these or any other means. We do not expect similar amounts to be trapped in future periods in the short-term as we expect there will be little to no excess cash flow at the two properties after paying property expenses, interest and capital expenditure. As of December 31, 2020, we have $2.9 million cash trapped and maintained in restricted cash associated with this event. This restricted cash is not available to be used for other corporate purposes. We can remain subject to this reserve requirement through maturity of the loan without causing an event of default under loan that could give rise to the lenders' right to accelerate the principal amount due under the loan or further penalty or ramifications.\nWe are also currently in breach of a debt service coverage and debt yield covenants under the non-recourse mortgage loan with $55.0 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 secured by the 9 Times Square property as of the year ended December 31, 2020. These breaches were caused by the January 2021 bankruptcy of one of our tenants, Knotel, a co-working company that was previously the second largest tenant in our portfolio based on annualized straight-line rent as of September 30, 2020. These breaches are not events of default, but rather require us to enter into a cash management period whereby all rents and other revenue of the property are to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants may be cured after achieving two consecutive quarters when the required debt service coverage and debt yield for the property is maintained. We may remain in breach of the covenants for up to four consecutive quarters, after which an event of default could occur that could give the lenders the right to accelerate the principal amount due under the loan and other remedies.\nWhile we have entered into short-term leases with two of Knotel's former tenants at 123 William Street that collectively represent over 23,400 square feet and we are working to find new tenants to replace Knotel and to increase the rental income at our 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square properties through leasing activity, there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all. Unless we are able to enter into new leases at both the properties on terms that allow us to cure the breach, we will be unable to access excess cash flow from either property. If we experience additional lease terminations, due to tenant bankruptcies or otherwise, it is possible that certain of the covenants on other loans may be breached and we may also become restricted from accessing excess cash flows from those properties. We were in compliance with the remaining covenants under our mortgage notes payable as of December 31, 2020.\nCommon Stock ATM Program\nOn October 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, offer, issue and sell to the public, through our sales agents, shares of Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million in an at the market\u201d equity offering program (the Common Stock ATM Program\u201d). Under SEC rules,\nas long as the aggregate market value of our outstanding Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, remains below $75.0 million, the maximum aggregate offering amount of the shares sold pursuant to the Common Stock ATM Program will be $18.7 million. Following the conversion of an additional 3,174,760 shares of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock on March 1, 2021, our public float has increased and we expect we will be able to offer and sell shares in excess of $18.7 million once we file a new prospectus supplement with the SEC. We have not yet sold any shares of Class A common stock through the Common Stock ATM Program.\nRepurchase Program\nOur board of directors has adopted a resolution authorizing consideration of share repurchases of up to $100.0 million of shares of Class A common stock over a long-term period following the listing of our Class common stock on the NYSE. Actual repurchases would be reviewed and approved by our board of directors based on management recommendations taking into consideration all information available at the specific time including our available cash resources (including the ability to borrow), market capitalization, trading price and alternative uses such as acquisitions. Repurchases would typically be made on the open market in accordance with SEC rules creating a safe harbor for issuer repurchases but may also occur in privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2020, no shares had been repurchased by us under this program. As of December 31, 2020, we also had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $31.0 million. We are also subject to a covenant under one of our mortgage loans requiring us to maintain minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of $10.0 million. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors - Our ability to fund our capital requirements will depend on, among other things, the amount of cash we are able to generate from our operations and outside sources, which may not be available on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all.\u201d\nLeasing Activity/Occupancy\nWe had an occupancy level of 87.0% across our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as compared to 89.6% as of December 31, 2019. The significant year-over-year occupancy changes were as follows:\n\u2022Occupancy at 9 Times Square decreased to 78.7% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 90.1% last year. The decrease was due to the termination or expiration of seven leases, which caused leased square footage to decrease by approximately 20,000 square feet, with no new leases commenced during the year.\n\u2022Occupancy at 123 William Street was 90.3% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 92.5% last year. The decrease was due to the termination or expiration of four leases during the year, which was offset by the commencement of a new lease in one space, and caused a net decrease in leased square footage of approximately 12,000 square feet as compared to December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, occupancy includes the leased space occupied by one of our tenants, Knotel, which is a tenant at both our 9 Times Square and 123 William Street properties. In January 2021, Knotel filed for bankruptcy and all leases were terminated effective January 31, 2020. If Knotel was not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2020, occupancy for 9 Times Square would have been 57.7%, occupancy for 123 William Street would have been 83.6% and occupancy across our portfolio would have been 80.8%. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we put certain tenants on a cash basis and fully reserved certain receivables and reflected this as a reduction in revenue from tenants during the period. For additional information on our accounting policy related to revenue recognition, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, for a discussion of overall impact on our result of operations for this and other reserves and write-offs for tenant receivables recorded in 2020 and for additional information on leasing activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Results of Operations section located in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nWe continue to focus on increasing occupancy of the portfolio by seeking replacement tenants for leases that had expired or otherwise have been terminated. We believe that certain market tenant incentives we have used and expect to continue to use, including free rent periods and tenant improvements, will support our occupancy rate and extend the average duration of our leases upon commencement of executed leases. While we do not receive cash during initial free rent periods, which has impacted and may continue to impact the net cash provided by our property operations in recent periods adversely, we believe this helps position us to negotiate longer, more attractive lease terms by having the flexibility to include such a feature.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 we funded $3.8 million of capital expenditures primarily related to tenant improvements at our 123 William Street, 9 Times Square and 1140 Avenue of the Americas properties. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.7 million were primarily related to tenant improvements at our 123 William Street, 9 Times Square, and 1140 Avenue of the Americas properties. We may invest in additional capital expenditures to further enhance the value of our properties. Additionally, many of our lease agreements with tenants include provisions for tenant improvement allowances. The amount we invest in capital expenditures during 2021, including amounts we are, or expect to be, contractually obligated to fund under new or replacement leases, will likely be less than the amount invested in\n2020. We funded our capital expenditures during 2020 from cash on hand consisting of proceeds from financings and sales of real estate investments in prior periods, and expect to fund any future capital expenditures with available cash on hand and potential future financings. The recent economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted and could continue to impact our decisions on the amount and timing of future capital expenditures.\nTender Offer\nIn December 2020, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 65,000 shares of Class B common stock for cash at a purchase price equal to $7.00 per share. In February 2021, we purchased approximately 26,236 shares of Class B common stock following the expiration of the tender offer for a total cost to us of approximately $0.2 million, including fees and expenses relating to the tender offer, which was funded with cash on hand.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe had no acquisitions or dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe also continue to evaluate our strategic alternatives for our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property, where the sole tenant terminated its lease early and vacated the space during the second quarter of 2018. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of this property for a contract price of $7.1 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the buyer terminated the transaction and we retained the security deposit of $0.7 million. There can be no assurance we will be able to find a replacement buyer or a new tenant or as to how much, if any, liquidity we will be able to generate from this property. Moreover, because the property is unoccupied, it does not generate any revenues that offset the cost of owning and maintaining the property.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis section discusses the non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our performance, including Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and Cash Net Operating Income ( Cash NOI\u201d). A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided below.\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a performance measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper and approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper\u201d). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gain and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities (including our OP) and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates are made to arrive at our proportionate share of FFO attributable to our stockholders. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nCore Funds from Operations\nBeginning in the third quarter 2020, following the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we began presenting Core FFO as a non-GAAP metric. We have presented prior periods on a comparable basis so that the metric is useful to the users of our financial statements. We believe that Core FFO is utilized by other publicly-traded REITs although Core FFO presented by us may not be comparable to Core FFO reported by other REITs that define Core FFO differently. In calculating\nCore FFO, we start with FFO, then we exclude the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our real estate operating portfolio, which is our core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating items include acquisition and transaction related costs for dead deals, debt extinguishment costs, listing related costs and expenses (including the vesting and conversion of Class B Units and cash expenses and fees which are non-recurring in nature incurred in connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE and related transactions), and non-cash equity-based compensation. We add back non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred with the early extinguishment of debt which are included in net income but are considered financing cash flows when paid in the statement of cash flows. We consider these write-offs and prepayment penalties to be capital transactions and not indicative of operations. By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction dead deal costs as well as non-operating costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nAccounting Treatment of Rent Deferrals\nThe majority of the concessions granted to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are rent deferrals or temporary rent abatements with the original lease term unchanged and collection of deferred rent deemed probable (see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information). As a result of relief granted by the FASB and the SEC related to lease modification accounting, rental revenue used to calculate Net Income, NAREIT FFO and Core FFO have not been, and we do not expect it to be, significantly impacted by these types of deferrals. For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy, including details related to the relief granted by the FASB and SEC, see Note 2 - Significant Accounting Polices to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of FFO and Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 and presents the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 on a comparable basis:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40,962) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,890) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,112) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>31,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO (as defined by NAREIT) attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,215) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, transaction and other costs </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listing expenses (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vesting and conversion of Class B Units </td> <td> </td> <td>1,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>3,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,889) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\n(1) Included in Net loss, FFO and Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 is other income of approximately $0.7 million related to the recognition of income from the retention of a deposit forfeited by the potential buyer on the potential sale of the property commonly known as the HIT Factory pursuant to a purchase agreement which expired in April 2020.\n(2) Listing expenses include financial advisory and other professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE in August 2020. These costs are non-recurring and are not part of the operations of our real estate portfolio as they were incurred only as a result of our decision to list our Class A common stock on the NYSE.\nCash Net Operating Income\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less income from investment securities and interest, plus general and administrative expenses, acquisition and transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense. In calculating Cash NOI, we also eliminate the effects of straight-lining of rent and the amortization of above- and below-market leases. Cash NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.\nWe use Cash NOI internally as a performance measure and believe Cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe Cash NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe Cash NOI is useful to investors as performance measures because, when compared across periods, Cash NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in\noccupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis. Cash NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and Cash NOI is not affected by whether the financing is at the property level or corporate level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Cash NOI presented by us may not be comparable to Cash NOI reported by other REITs that define Cash NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, Cash NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of Cash NOI for the periods presented.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40,962) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,890) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,112) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>31,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>19,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,294 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, transaction and other costs </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>1,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vesting and conversion of Class B Units </td> <td> </td> <td>1,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>3,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td>(787) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(847) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(444) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset and property management fees to related parties </td> <td> </td> <td>7,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>7,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,958 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of below- and amortization of above-market lease liabilities and assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,026) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,563) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,044) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent (revenues as lessor) </td> <td> </td> <td>(402) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,219) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,544) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line ground rent (expenses as lessee) </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash NOI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,542 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nWe are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. A tax loss for a particular year eliminates the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90% distribution requirement for that year and may minimize or eliminate the need to pay distributions in order to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in 2020 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, from a U.S. federal income tax perspective, 100% of dividends, or $0.04889 per share, represented a return of capital. The dividend declared and paid in January 2021 is a 2021 event for stockholders and the tax treatment of this dividend will be disclosed when information regarding the year ending December 31, 2021 is reported.\nOn February 27, 2018, our board of directors unanimously authorized a suspension of the distributions we pay to the holders of our common stock, effective as of March 1, 2018, and we did not pay distributions during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid distributions to common stockholders of $11.7 million, all of which were paid during the three months ended March 31, 2018, prior to suspending distributions. Of that amount, $4.2 million was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. During January and February 2018, when we were paying distributions, we funded distributions from cash on hand, representing proceeds from secured mortgages financing. In connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we announced that our board of directors intended to reinstate distributions in the form of dividends to our common stockholders in the amount of $0.40 per share of common stock per year. On October 1, 2020, we declared a dividend equal to $0.04889 per share on each share of common stock, which was paid on October 15, 2020. The dividend was calculated to cover the period from August 18, 2020, the date on which shares of Class A common stock commenced trading on the NYSE, through September 30, 2020, based on the previously-announced cash dividend rate equal to $0.40 per share per year. On January 1, 2021, we also declared a dividend equal to $0.10 per share on each share of common stock, which was paid on January 15, 2021.\nDecisions regarding the frequency and amount of any future dividends we pay on our common stock will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend policy at any time and for any reason. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on our ability to operate profitably and to generate sufficient cash flows from the operations of our existing properties and any properties we may acquire. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular basis on our common stock or any other class or series of stock we may issue in the future. Our Board previously suspended and then reinstituted dividends. There is no assurance we will continue to pay dividends. The amount of dividends payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for dividends, our financial condition, provisions in any agreement we are party to that may restrict our ability to pay dividends, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT. Provisions contained in our loan agreements may also impact our ability to pay dividends or make repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows used in operations were $13.6 million. During this period, we paid dividends of $0.6 million. These dividend payments were not funded from cash flows from operations, but rather from available cash on hand consisting of proceeds from financings and sales of real estate investments in prior periods. Funding dividends from these sources reduces the capital available for other requirements, such as capital expenditures at our existing properties, investing in new properties and payment of operating expenses.\nThe following table shows the sources for the payment of dividends to holders of common stock and distributions to holders of LTIP Units for the periods indicated:\nTable 21:

elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so that we qualify as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner but can provide no assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. A tax loss for a particular year eliminates the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90% distribution requirement for that year and may minimize or eliminate the need to pay distributions in order to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in 2020 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT in 2020.\nInflation\nMany of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nPlease see Note 9 - Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed REIT that invests primarily in office properties located exclusively within the five boroughs of New York City, primarily Manhattan. We have also purchased certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, and may purchase hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types also located exclusively within the five boroughs of New York City. As of December 31, 2020, we owned eight properties consisting of 1,163,061 rentable square feet acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $790.7 million.\nOn August 18, 2020, we listed shares of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. In anticipation of the listing, we implemented a series of corporate actions which resulted in the bifurcation of our common stock into Class A common stock and Class B common stock in a net reduction of 2.43 shares for every one share of common stock outstanding prior to these corporate actions, which we refer to as the Reverse Stock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts as of dates prior to August 5, 2020 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on that date. To effect the listing, and to address the potential for selling pressure that may have existed at the outset of listing, we listed only shares of Class A common stock, which represented approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock, on the NYSE when trading commenced. Our other class of outstanding stock is Class B common stock, which comprised approximately 75% of our outstanding shares of common stock at that time. The first of three equal tranches of shares of Class B common stock that were not listed on the NYSE on the listing date converted into 3,189,204 shares of Class A common stock and the shares were listed on the NYSE on December 16, 2020. Following a determination by our board of directors, the second tranche of shares of Class B common stock converted into 3,176,127 shares of Class A common stock and were listed on the NYSE on March 1, 2021. The remaining tranche of shares of Class B common stock will convert into shares of Class A common stock to be listed on the NYSE on August 13, 2021, unless earlier converted. For additional information, see Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through the OP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our Advisor manages our day-to-day business with the assistance of our Property Manager. Our Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to us. We also reimburse these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to us.\nManagement Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has created several risks and uncertainties that may impact our business, including our future results of operations and our liquidity. A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19 affecting New York City, where we and our tenants operate could have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The ultimate impact on our results of operations, our liquidity and the ability of our tenants to continue to pay us rent will depend on numerous factors including the overall length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management is unable to predict the nature and scope of any of these factors. These factors include the following, among others:\n\u2022The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all. However, we have taken proactive steps with regard to rent collections to mitigate the impact on our business (see -Management Actions\u201d below). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced several lease expirations without renewals as well as terminations, including four during the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, one of our tenants, Knotel, declared bankruptcy in early 2021. Management has already re-leased a portion of the vacant space and is working on securing additional new leases, although there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022There may be a decline in the demand for tenants to lease real estate, as well as a negative impact on rental rates. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio had an occupancy level of 87.0% (80.8% giving effect to the termination of all Knotel's leases with us in January 2021), the weighted-average remaining term of our leases was 7.2 (based on annualized straight-line rent).\n\u2022New York City, where all of our properties are located, has been among the hardest hit locations in the country and until it began its phased reopening in June 2020, which is still underway as of December 31, 2020, operated under a mandatory order under which tenants were required to cease all non-essential in-office functions. Certain restrictions\nhave since been imposed, and there may be further restrictions in the future. Our properties remain accessible to all tenants, although, even as operating restrictions expire, not all tenants have resumed operations. In addition, as New York's phased opening continues, and occupants continue to return to our properties, operating costs may begin to rise, including for services, labor and personal protective equipment and other supplies, as our property managers take appropriate actions to protect tenants and property management personnel. Some of these costs may be recoverable through reimbursement from tenants but others will be borne by us. However, despite the current restrictions and continued reopening, we expect that the mass vaccine rollout will target a return to normalcy\u201d after the summer holidays and will support an uptick in office usage and leasing trends by the end of 2021 and through 2022.\n\u2022Capital market volatility and a tightening of credit standards could negatively impact our ability to obtain debt financing. We do not have any significant debt principal repayments due until 2024.\n\u2022The negative impact of the pandemic on our results of operations and cash flows has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to comply with covenants in our loans. The impact of COVID-19 on our tenants led to early lease terminations and expirations without renewals that caused cash trap events on two of our mortgages as described further in this section.\n\u2022The potential negative impact on the health of personnel of our Advisor, particularly if a significant number of the Advisor's employees are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity.\nFor additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions and may worsen\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Advisor has responded to the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in early March 2020, the Advisor took proactive steps to prepare for and actively mitigate the inevitable disruption COVID-19 would cause, such as, enacting safety measures, both required or recommended by relevant government authorities, including remote working policies, cooperation with localized closure or curfew directives, and social distancing measures at all of our properties. Additionally, there has been no material adverse impact on our financial reporting systems or internal controls and procedures and the Advisor's ability to perform services for us. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are supplementing the historical discussion of our results of operations for the year ended 2020 with a current update on the measures we have taken to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on our business and future results of operations.\nManagement's Actions\nWe have taken several steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business. For rent collections, we have been in direct contact with our tenants since the crisis began, continuing to cultivate open dialogue and deepen the fundamental relationships that we have carefully developed through prior transactions and historic operations. Based on this approach and the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of our tenants, we believe that we have had positive results in our cash rent collections during this pandemic.\nOur portfolio is primarily comprised of office and retail tenants with 78% and 21% of fourth quarter cash rent due from office and retail tenants, respectively. We have collected 86% of fourth quarter cash rent due from our office tenants, 64% of cash rent due from our retail tenants and 82% of cash rent due across our entire portfolio, including 89% of cash rent due from our top ten tenants (based on annualized straight-line rent as of December 31, 2020). The cash rent collected across our entire portfolio was consistent with the third quarter in which we reported total portfolio original cash rent collections of 85% due for the third quarter as of October 31, 2020, which has improved to 86% of third quarter's original cash rent collected as of March 23, 2021. We also reported total portfolio original cash rent collections of 86% due for the second quarter as of October 31, 2020, which remains unchanged as of March 23, 2021. During the fourth quarter, we concluded that it was no longer probable that we would collect substantially all of the amounts due from a number of tenants due to the on-going impacts of COVID. These included most significantly Knotel, a tenant at both our 123 William Street and 9 Times Square properties, as well as several smaller tenants. Accordingly, these tenants were placed on a cash basis and all receivables were fully reserved with additional reserves of $7.4 million ($2.9 million in contract receivables and $4.5 million in straight-line rent receivables) recorded in the fourth quarter.\nThe table below presents additional information on our fourth quarter cash rent collection status and is based on available information as of March 1, 2021.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter 2020 Cash Rent Status </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter cash rent paid (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approved agreements (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agreement negotiation (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1) Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments thereafter prior to an approved agreement.\n(2) Consists of deferral agreements as well as amendments granting the tenant a rent credit for some portion of cash rent due. The rent credit is generally coupled with an extension of the lease. The terms of the lease amendments providing for rent credits differ by tenant in terms of length and amount of the credit. A deferral agreement is an executed or approved amendment to an existing lease to defer a certain portion of cash rent due. The most common arrangements represent deferral of some or all of the rent due for the second or third quarter of 2020 with such amounts to be paid in 2021.\n(3) Represents active tenant discussions where no approved agreement has yet been reached. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful and will lead to formal agreements on favorable terms, or at all. These amounts are substantially comprised of tenants that were placed on a cash basis, including Knotel which represents 6% of fourth quarter cash rent due, after concluding that it was no longer probable that substantially all amounts due would be collected. We have fully reserved for amounts due from these tenants as a reduction in revenue as of December 31, 2020.\n(4) Consists of tenants who have made a partial payment and/or tenants without active communication on a potential approved agreement. There can be no assurance that such cash rent will be collected. Includes approximately 0.25% of fourth quarter cash rent due from a tenant that was placed on cash basis during the fourth quarter for which we have fully reserved as a reduction in revenue as of December 31, 2020.\nThrough March 23, 2021, we had collected 82% of January 2021 cash rent due and 86% of February 2021 cash rent due (with the increase in February partially due to the fact that Knotel is not included in our rent collection data after January 31, 2021 when all of their leases with us terminated). Fourth quarter rent collections were particularly impacted by the Knotel bankruptcy and a lease amendment with one of our tenants that granted a rent credit of $0.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 in exchange for a 24-month lease extension. Moreover, certain tenants that have entered into agreements with us with respect to second, third or fourth quarter rents have, following the expiration of those agreements, sought to enter into new agreements further deferring or abating rent for additional periods. There can be no assurance additional tenants will not similarly seek future rent relief or that we will be able to collect the cash rent that is due in future months including the deferred 2020 rent amounts due during 2021 under deferral agreements we have entered into with our tenants. Through March 23, 2021, we had collected 25% of January 2021 cash rent due that represented 2020 cash rent that had been deferred until 2021 and 32% of February 2021 cash rent due that represented 2020 cash rent that had been deferred until 2021. We expect this trend of lower collections of amounts previously deferred may continue in future months in 2021. We expect our cash rent collections will stay at current levels and could potentially decline until the New York City economy reopens and recovers sufficiently for our tenants ability to pay rent to improve, although there can be no assurance how long this will take. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the amount of cash rent that we collect going forward cannot be determined at present.\nWe have entered into 18 approved agreements with 11 different tenants that commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020. Under approved agreements entered into during 2020, the total amount deferred was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Under approved agreements entered into during 2020, the total amounts of rent credits (i.e. abatements) was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the critical accounting policies that management believes is important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:\nImpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAs discussed above, we have taken a proactive approach to achieve mutually agreeable solutions with tenants impacted by COVID-19 and in some cases, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, we executed different types of lease amendments. These agreements include deferrals and abatements and also may include extensions to the term of the leases.\nFor accounting purposes, in accordance with ASC 842: Leases, normally a company would be required to assess a lease modification to determine if the lease modification should be treated as a separate lease and if not, modification accounting would be applied which would require a company to reassess the classification of the lease (including leases for which the prior classification under ASC 840 was retained as part of the election to apply the package of practical expedients allowed upon the adoption of ASC 842, which does not apply to leases subsequently modified). However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in\nwhich many leases are being modified, the FASB and SEC have provided relief that allows companies to make a policy election as to whether they treat COVID-19 related lease amendments as a provision included in the pre-concession arrangement, and therefore, not a lease modification, or to treat the lease amendment as a modification. In order to be considered COVID-19 related, cash flows must be substantially the same or less than those prior to the concession. For COVID-19 relief qualified changes, there are two methods to potentially account for such rent deferrals or abatements under the relief, (1) as if the changes were originally contemplated in the lease contract or (2) as if the deferred payments are variable lease payments contained in the lease contract. For all other lease changes that did not qualify for FASB relief, we would be required to apply modification accounting including assessing classification under ASC 842.\nSome, but not all of our lease modifications qualify for the FASB relief. In accordance with the relief provisions, instead of treating these qualifying leases as modifications, we have elected to treat the modifications as if previously contained in the lease and recast rents receivable prospectively (if necessary). Under that accounting, for modifications that were deferrals only, there would be no impact on overall rental revenue and for any abatement amounts that reduced total rent to be received, the impact would be recognized ratably over the remaining life of the lease.\nFor leases not qualifying for this relief, we applied modification accounting and determined that there were no changes in the current classification of its leases impacted by negotiations with its tenants.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue from tenants, which are derived primarily from lease contracts, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. As of December 31, 2020, these leases had an average remaining lease term of 7.2 years. Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires that we record a receivable for, and include in revenue from tenants, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease modification is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. Pursuant to certain of our lease agreements, tenants are required to reimburse us for certain property operating expenses (recorded in total revenue from tenants), in addition to paying base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties. Under ASC 842, we have elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line Revenue from tenants\u201d. For comparative purposes, we have also elected to reflect prior revenue and reimbursements reported under ASC 842 on a single line. For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under both ASC 842 and 840, we have reflected them on a net basis.\nIncluded in revenue from tenants for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $0.1 million of tenant reimbursement related to prior year.\nWe own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets. As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income, until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in contingent rental income is included in revenue from tenants in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rents receivable and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. Under the leasing standard adopted on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion), we are required to assess, based on credit risk, if it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments at the lease commencement date and we must continue to reassess collectability periodically thereafter based on new facts and circumstances affecting the credit risk of the tenant. In fiscal 2020, this assessment has included consideration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our tenant's ability to pay rents in accordance with their contracts. Partial reserves, or the ability to assume partial recovery are no longer permitted. If we determine that it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments (base rent and additional rent), the lease will continue to be accounted for on an accrual basis (i.e., straight-line). However, if we determine that it is not probable that it will collect virtually all of the lease payments, the lease will be accounted for on a cash basis and a full reserve would be recorded on previously accrued amounts in cases where it was subsequently concluded that collection was not probable. Cost recoveries from tenants are included in revenue from tenants in accordance with current accounting rules, on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.\nIn accordance with the lease accounting rules we record uncollectable amounts as reductions in revenue from tenants. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we reduced revenue from tenants by $8.5 million for reserves recorded during the period on receivables for which the related tenants have been put on a cash basis (see accounting policy above). There were no such reductions recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nAt the time an asset is acquired, we evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of the asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. See the Purchase Price Allocation section below for a discussion of the initial accounting for investments in real estate.\nDisposal of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. No properties were presented as discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale, most significantly that the sale is probable within one year. We evaluate probability of sale based on specific facts including whether a sales agreement is in place and the buyer has made significant non-refundable deposits. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any properties held for sale.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - ASU No. 2016-02 Leases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of our leases as lessor prior to adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019 were accounted for as operating leases and we continued to account for them as operating leases under the transition guidance. We evaluate new leases originated after the adoption date (by us or by a predecessor lessor/owner) pursuant to the new guidance where a lease for some or all of a building is classified by a lessor as a sales-type lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership reside with the tenant. This situation is met if, among other things, there is an automatic transfer of title during the lease, a bargain purchase option, the non-cancelable lease term is for more than major part of remaining economic useful life of the asset (e.g., equal to or greater than 75%), if the present value of the minimum lease payments represents substantially all (e.g., equal to or greater than 90%) of the leased property's fair value at lease inception, or if the asset so specialized in nature that it provides no alternative use to the lessor (and therefore would not provide any future value to the lessor) after the lease term. Further, such new leases would be evaluated to consider whether they would be failed sale-leaseback transactions and accounted for as financing transactions by the lessor. For the three year period ended December 31, 2020, we have no leases as a lessor that would be considered as sales-type leases or financings under sale-leaseback rules.\nWe are also the lessee under a land lease which was previously classified prior to adoption of lease accounting, and will continue to be classified, as operating leases under transition elections unless subsequently modified. These leases are reflected on the balance sheet and the rent expense is reflected on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nIn both a business combination and an asset acquisition, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as if vacant basis. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below- market leases and other identifiable assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests (in a business combination) are recorded at their estimated fair values. In allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates. In a business combination, the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is either recorded as goodwill or as a bargain purchase gain. In an asset acquisition, the difference between the acquisition price (including capitalized transaction costs) and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is allocated to the non-current assets. There were no asset acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were asset acquisitions.\nFor acquired properties with leases classified as operating leases, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nTangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Fair value estimates are also made using significant assumptions such as capitalization rates, discount rates, fair market lease rates and land values per square foot.\nIdentifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates and the value of in-place leases as applicable. Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 24 months. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nAbove-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of its existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. We did not record any intangible asset amounts related to customer relationships recorded in connection with the acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nGain on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nGains on sales of rental real estate after January 1, 2018 are not considered sales to customers and will generally be recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets ( ASC 610-20\u201d).\nGain on sales of real estate prior to January 1, 2018 are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360-20, Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20\u201d). The specific timing of a sale was measured against various criteria in and ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, depending on the circumstances, we may not record a sale or it may record a sale but may defer some or all of the gain recognition. If the criteria for full accrual are not met, we may account for the transaction by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria for the full accrual method are met. We did not have any dispositions during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the property for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If an impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, we would recognize an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss recorded would equal the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net earnings. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nThe value of customer relationship intangibles, if any, is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nAssumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.\nAbove and Below-Market Lease Amortization\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of revenue from tenants over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to revenue from tenants over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. If a tenant with a below-market rent renewal does not renew any remaining unamortized amount will be taken into income at that time.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets. The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.\nWe record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply, or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. If we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any change in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

tenant improvements and leasing commissions were incurred in the period in which the lease commenced, which may be different than the period in which these amounts are actually paid. Does not include tenant improvements and leasing commissions on new leases that are not replacement leases.\nIn addition to the comparative period-over-period discussions below, please see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and management's responses.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to 2019\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned eight properties, comprising of seven properties acquired prior to January 2019 and our 196 Orchard Street property acquired in July 2019 ( 196 Orchard Street\u201d). Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflect changes due to leasing activity and the impact of our acquisition of 196 Orchard Street properties.\nRevenue from Tenants\nRevenue from tenants decreased $7.6 million to $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to reserves of $8.5 million recorded during the period on receivables ($3.0 million of accounts receivables and $5.5 million of straight-line rent receivables) for which the related tenants (including Knotel, but also certain other tenants that continue to occupy the space they have leased from us) have have been put on a cash basis or have terminated their leases early, primarily as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the reserves recorded, $7.5 million was related to receivables from tenants that were put on a cash basis in 2020 and $1.0 million was related to receivables from tenants that terminated their leases early. Of the amount that related to receivables from tenants that were put on cash basis, $1.5 million relates to straight-line rent that would have otherwise been recorded in the fourth quarter. While we have entered into short-term leases with two of Knotel's former tenants at 123 William Street that collectively represent over 23,400 square feet and we are working to find new tenants to replace Knotel and to increase the rental income at our properties through leasing activity, there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all. There was also a decrease in reimbursable operating expenses, such as utilities, due to fewer tenants working at the properties during the period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe decreases to our year-over-year revenue from tenants were partially offset by the incremental impact of a full year of revenue from tenants in 2020 from our 196 Orchard Street acquisition (acquired in July 2019) and the write-off of below-market lease intangibles in connection with leases terminated during the current year.\nAsset and Property Management Fees to Related Parties\nWe incurred $7.6 million and $7.3 million in fees for asset and property management services to our Advisor and Property Manager for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This is primarily related to the impact of property management fees due to the Property Manager that are no longer adjusted for reimbursable expenses paid by us to third-party property managers beginning on April 1, 2019. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in property management fees due to the calculation being based on cash receipts, which decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on fees incurred to our Advisor and Property Manager.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased $1.1 million to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in condominium fees and property taxes, which were previously directly paid by certain tenants that stopped paying these obligations under their leases and we expect will continue to be paid by us while these tenants are not paying rent. In addition, the increase to our property operating expenses was impacted by the incremental effect of a full year of property operating expenses in 2020 from our 196 Orchard Street acquisition (acquired in July 2019).\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nWe incurred no acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $13,000 of acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nListing Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $1.3 million of expenses associated with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE.\nVesting and Conversion of Class B Units\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash expense of $1.2 million related to the vesting and conversion of Class B Units. The vesting conditions relating to the Class B Units were fully satisfied upon completion of the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. On the listing date, 65,498 Class B Units were converted into Class A Units, of which 52,398 held by the Advisor were subsequently redeemed for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation increased $3.8 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $86,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the recording of $3.8 million of expense related to the 2020 OPP as well as amortization related to restricted shares of common stock. Approximately $0.1 million of expense was recorded for the amortization of restricted shares of common stock. See Note 11 - Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the 2020 OPP and restricted shares of common stock.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased legal and audit fees. Legal fees increased due to legal costs associated with negotiating with our tenants as a result of COVID-19 and expenses incurred associated with the tender offer for shares of Class B common stock completed in January 2021, as well as costs associated with capital-raising and other activity related to the Listing.\nTotal reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services provided by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3.6 million, of which $1.0 million related to administrative and overhead expenses and $2.6 million were for salaries, wages, and benefits. This is compared to $3.2 million of reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services for the year ended December 31, 2019. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses and reimbursements for salaries, wages, and benefits are subject to an annual limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the annual limits on reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses on and for salaries, wages, and benefit were reached. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also received a credit of $0.4 million relating to a change in estimate for previously paid 2019 bonuses. The limit on reimbursement for salaries, wages and benefits was evaluated without regard to our 2019 bonus reimbursement from the Advisor. On a combined basis, giving effect to the credit, our reimbursements to our Advisor were approximately the same year over year. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $0.5 million to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an out-of-period charge of $0.3 million in 2020 (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and due to a higher depreciable asset base as a result of the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street completed in July 2019 and the net effect of fixed and intangible asset write-offs associated with lease terminations recorded during the current year. As a result of the termination of our leases with Knotel effective January 31, 2021 following Knotel's filing for bankruptcy earlier that month, we will write-off all related intangibles, including an estimated $1.3 million of deferred leasing costs, which will be included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.9 million to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to loans we entered into in April 2019 secured by 9 Times Square and July 2019 in connection with the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street (see Note 4 - Mortgage Notes Payable, Net to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). During the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted-average outstanding debt balance was $405.0 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our weighted average outstanding debt balance was $359.9 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%.\nOther Income\nOther income remained consistent at $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Approximately $0.7 million of the other income in 2020 is related to the recognition of income from the retention of a deposit forfeited by the buyer on the potential sale of the property commonly known as the HIT Factory\u201d under a purchase agreement which expired in April 2020. This increase was partially offset by a decline in interest income on invested cash due to a decline in rates.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the restricted cash we are required to maintain, the timing of interest payments, the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.6 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of $41.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $35.3 million, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion/amortization of below market and above market lease liabilities and assets and share-based compensation, as well as the vesting and conversion of Class B Units. Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash outflows of $7.4 million for an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, $0.3 million for a net increase in straight-line receivables and $0.5 million related to a decrease related to accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with operating activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by a $0.3 million increase related to additional deferred (prepaid rent) revenue.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million which consisted of a net loss of $21.9 million, and, after adjustments for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets and other non-cash expenses of $31.0 million, resulted in cash inflows of $9.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash outflow of $1.5 million for a decrease in rent payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates and a decrease in other liabilities of $2.1 million for a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These operating cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.0 million primarily related to unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis, payment of real estate taxes and deferred leasing costs.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.8 million related to the funding of capital expenditures relating to tenant and building improvements at 9 Times Square, 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $46.0 million related to capital expenditures of $7.7 million primarily due to building and tenant improvements at 9 Times Square, 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas and $38.3 million due to the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street in July 2019.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the redemption of fractional shares of common stock of $0.3 million and restricted shares following the Reverse Stock Split that occurred on August 5, 2020 as well as dividends paid on common stock of $0.6 million in October 2020 (see Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $55.0 million, partially offset by payments of $3.9 million relating to financing costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for cash are to fund operating and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to our properties, our debt service obligations and, subject to capital availability, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $31.0 million as compared to $39.1 million as of September 30, 2020 and $51.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Under the guarantee of certain enumerated recourse liabilities of the borrower under one of our mortgage loans, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth in excess of $175.0 million and minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of $10.0 million.\nOur principal sources of cash in recent periods have been the net cash, if any, provided by our current property operations and cash on hand consisting primarily of proceeds from financings of then-unencumbered assets. In some recent periods, including the fourth quarter and full year 2020, the net cash provided by our property operations has not alone been sufficient to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all, which has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the amount of cash we receive from our operations and therefore our ability to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements, which, beginning in October 2020, include dividends to our common stockholders. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, as described in more detail below, the operating results at 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square properties were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic leading to early lease terminations and expirations without renewals that caused cash trap events under the non-recourse mortgages for those properties to be triggered. Specifically for these properties, there were early lease terminations, expirations without renewal and a tenant bankruptcy for a significant tenant in the 9 Times Square property (Knotel). As a result, at these properties, which together represent 61% of the rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, we will not be able to use excess cash flow from the properties to fund operating expenses at our other properties and other capital requirements until the breaches have been cured.\nIn addition to the discussion below, see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and management's actions taken in response. Due to rent deferrals and the other impacts of COVID-19, as well as the terms of our leases, we anticipate we may continue to fund a portion of our operating expenses and other capital requirements with cash on hand through at least the first half of 2021. We do not have any significant debt principal repayments due until 2024, and we believe that we will have sufficient cash available to us to meet our operating cash requirements over the next year. We expect to fund our future capital needs, including for acquisitions or share repurchases, if authorized, through a combination of net cash, if any, provided by our current property operations, or the operations of properties that we may acquire in the future, proceeds from property dispositions (if any) and proceeds from our Common Stock ATM Program (as defined below) or other future equity offerings and debt financings.\nMortgage Loans\nWe have six mortgage loans secured by seven of our eight properties with an aggregate balance of $405.0 million as of December 31, 2020 with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%. We do not currently have a commitment for a corporate-level revolving credit facility or any other corporate-level indebtedness, and there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain corporate-level financing on favorable terms, or at all. Our only asset that is not serving as collateral for a mortgage is 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory, which is unoccupied and therefore unlikely to be accepted as collateral for a new mortgage loan. See -Acquisitions and Dispositions\u201d section below for further detail on this property. We do not currently anticipate incurring additional indebtedness secured by our existing properties, however, despite a tightening of the credit markets, we expect to be able to continue to use debt financing as a source of capital to the extent we acquire additional properties.\nWe do not have principal payments due on our mortgage notes payable for the year ending December 31, 2021.\nWe have been in breach of a debt service coverage provision and a reserve fund reserve provision under the non-recourse mortgage loan with $99.0 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 secured by the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property for the last two quarters. These breaches are not events of default, rather they require excess cash (after payment of operating costs, debt service and capital/tenant replacement reserves) to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants for this loan may be cured after achieving two consecutive quarters when the required debt service coverage for the property is maintained, whereupon the additional collateral will be released. Currently, we have not cured the breaches through these or any other means. We do not expect similar amounts to be trapped in future periods in the short-term as we expect there will be little to no excess cash flow at the two properties after paying property expenses, interest and capital expenditure. As of December 31, 2020, we have $2.9 million cash trapped and maintained in restricted cash associated with this event. This restricted cash is not available to be used for other corporate purposes. We can remain subject to this reserve requirement through maturity of the loan without causing an event of default under loan that could give rise to the lenders' right to accelerate the principal amount due under the loan or further penalty or ramifications.\nWe are also currently in breach of a debt service coverage and debt yield covenants under the non-recourse mortgage loan with $55.0 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 secured by the 9 Times Square property as of the year ended December 31, 2020. These breaches were caused by the January 2021 bankruptcy of one of our tenants, Knotel, a co-working company that was previously the second largest tenant in our portfolio based on annualized straight-line rent as of September 30, 2020. These breaches are not events of default, but rather require us to enter into a cash management period whereby all rents and other revenue of the property are to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants may be cured after achieving two consecutive quarters when the required debt service coverage and debt yield for the property is maintained. We may remain in breach of the covenants for up to four consecutive quarters, after which an event of default could occur that could give the lenders the right to accelerate the principal amount due under the loan and other remedies.\nWhile we have entered into short-term leases with two of Knotel's former tenants at 123 William Street that collectively represent over 23,400 square feet and we are working to find new tenants to replace Knotel and to increase the rental income at our 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square properties through leasing activity, there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all. Unless we are able to enter into new leases at both the properties on terms that allow us to cure the breach, we will be unable to access excess cash flow from either property. If we experience additional lease terminations, due to tenant bankruptcies or otherwise, it is possible that certain of the covenants on other loans may be breached and we may also become restricted from accessing excess cash flows from those properties. We were in compliance with the remaining covenants under our mortgage notes payable as of December 31, 2020.\nCommon Stock ATM Program\nOn October 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, offer, issue and sell to the public, through our sales agents, shares of Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million in an at the market\u201d equity offering program (the Common Stock ATM Program\u201d). Under SEC rules,\nas long as the aggregate market value of our outstanding Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, remains below $75.0 million, the maximum aggregate offering amount of the shares sold pursuant to the Common Stock ATM Program will be $18.7 million. Following the conversion of an additional 3,174,760 shares of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock on March 1, 2021, our public float has increased and we expect we will be able to offer and sell shares in excess of $18.7 million once we file a new prospectus supplement with the SEC. We have not yet sold any shares of Class A common stock through the Common Stock ATM Program.\nRepurchase Program\nOur board of directors has adopted a resolution authorizing consideration of share repurchases of up to $100.0 million of shares of Class A common stock over a long-term period following the listing of our Class common stock on the NYSE. Actual repurchases would be reviewed and approved by our board of directors based on management recommendations taking into consideration all information available at the specific time including our available cash resources (including the ability to borrow), market capitalization, trading price and alternative uses such as acquisitions. Repurchases would typically be made on the open market in accordance with SEC rules creating a safe harbor for issuer repurchases but may also occur in privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2020, no shares had been repurchased by us under this program. As of December 31, 2020, we also had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $31.0 million. We are also subject to a covenant under one of our mortgage loans requiring us to maintain minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of $10.0 million. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors - Our ability to fund our capital requirements will depend on, among other things, the amount of cash we are able to generate from our operations and outside sources, which may not be available on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all.\u201d\nLeasing Activity/Occupancy\nWe had an occupancy level of 87.0% across our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as compared to 89.6% as of December 31, 2019. The significant year-over-year occupancy changes were as follows:\n\u2022Occupancy at 9 Times Square decreased to 78.7% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 90.1% last year. The decrease was due to the termination or expiration of seven leases, which caused leased square footage to decrease by approximately 20,000 square feet, with no new leases commenced during the year.\n\u2022Occupancy at 123 William Street was 90.3% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 92.5% last year. The decrease was due to the termination or expiration of four leases during the year, which was offset by the commencement of a new lease in one space, and caused a net decrease in leased square footage of approximately 12,000 square feet as compared to December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, occupancy includes the leased space occupied by one of our tenants, Knotel, which is a tenant at both our 9 Times Square and 123 William Street properties. In January 2021, Knotel filed for bankruptcy and all leases were terminated effective January 31, 2020. If Knotel was not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2020, occupancy for 9 Times Square would have been 57.7%, occupancy for 123 William Street would have been 83.6% and occupancy across our portfolio would have been 80.8%. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we put certain tenants on a cash basis and fully reserved certain receivables and reflected this as a reduction in revenue from tenants during the period. For additional information on our accounting policy related to revenue recognition, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, for a discussion of overall impact on our result of operations for this and other reserves and write-offs for tenant receivables recorded in 2020 and for additional information on leasing activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Results of Operations section located in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nWe continue to focus on increasing occupancy of the portfolio by seeking replacement tenants for leases that had expired or otherwise have been terminated. We believe that certain market tenant incentives we have used and expect to continue to use, including free rent periods and tenant improvements, will support our occupancy rate and extend the average duration of our leases upon commencement of executed leases. While we do not receive cash during initial free rent periods, which has impacted and may continue to impact the net cash provided by our property operations in recent periods adversely, we believe this helps position us to negotiate longer, more attractive lease terms by having the flexibility to include such a feature.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 we funded $3.8 million of capital expenditures primarily related to tenant improvements at our 123 William Street, 9 Times Square and 1140 Avenue of the Americas properties. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.7 million were primarily related to tenant improvements at our 123 William Street, 9 Times Square, and 1140 Avenue of the Americas properties. We may invest in additional capital expenditures to further enhance the value of our properties. Additionally, many of our lease agreements with tenants include provisions for tenant improvement allowances. The amount we invest in capital expenditures during 2021, including amounts we are, or expect to be, contractually obligated to fund under new or replacement leases, will likely be less than the amount invested in\n2020. We funded our capital expenditures during 2020 from cash on hand consisting of proceeds from financings and sales of real estate investments in prior periods, and expect to fund any future capital expenditures with available cash on hand and potential future financings. The recent economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted and could continue to impact our decisions on the amount and timing of future capital expenditures.\nTender Offer\nIn December 2020, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 65,000 shares of Class B common stock for cash at a purchase price equal to $7.00 per share. In February 2021, we purchased approximately 26,236 shares of Class B common stock following the expiration of the tender offer for a total cost to us of approximately $0.2 million, including fees and expenses relating to the tender offer, which was funded with cash on hand.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe had no acquisitions or dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe also continue to evaluate our strategic alternatives for our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property, where the sole tenant terminated its lease early and vacated the space during the second quarter of 2018. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of this property for a contract price of $7.1 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the buyer terminated the transaction and we retained the security deposit of $0.7 million. There can be no assurance we will be able to find a replacement buyer or a new tenant or as to how much, if any, liquidity we will be able to generate from this property. Moreover, because the property is unoccupied, it does not generate any revenues that offset the cost of owning and maintaining the property.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis section discusses the non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our performance, including Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and Cash Net Operating Income ( Cash NOI\u201d). A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided below.\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a performance measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper and approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper\u201d). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gain and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities (including our OP) and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates are made to arrive at our proportionate share of FFO attributable to our stockholders. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nCore Funds from Operations\nBeginning in the third quarter 2020, following the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we began presenting Core FFO as a non-GAAP metric. We have presented prior periods on a comparable basis so that the metric is useful to the users of our financial statements. We believe that Core FFO is utilized by other publicly-traded REITs although Core FFO presented by us may not be comparable to Core FFO reported by other REITs that define Core FFO differently. In calculating\nCore FFO, we start with FFO, then we exclude the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our real estate operating portfolio, which is our core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating items include acquisition and transaction related costs for dead deals, debt extinguishment costs, listing related costs and expenses (including the vesting and conversion of Class B Units and cash expenses and fees which are non-recurring in nature incurred in connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE and related transactions), and non-cash equity-based compensation. We add back non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred with the early extinguishment of debt which are included in net income but are considered financing cash flows when paid in the statement of cash flows. We consider these write-offs and prepayment penalties to be capital transactions and not indicative of operations. By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction dead deal costs as well as non-operating costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nAccounting Treatment of Rent Deferrals\nThe majority of the concessions granted to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are rent deferrals or temporary rent abatements with the original lease term unchanged and collection of deferred rent deemed probable (see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information). As a result of relief granted by the FASB and the SEC related to lease modification accounting, rental revenue used to calculate Net Income, NAREIT FFO and Core FFO have not been, and we do not expect it to be, significantly impacted by these types of deferrals. For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy, including details related to the relief granted by the FASB and SEC, see Note 2 - Significant Accounting Polices to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of FFO and Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 and presents the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 on a comparable basis:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40,962) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,890) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,112) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>31,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO (as defined by NAREIT) attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,215) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, transaction and other costs </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listing expenses (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vesting and conversion of Class B Units </td> <td> </td> <td>1,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>3,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,889) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\n(1) Included in Net loss, FFO and Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 is other income of approximately $0.7 million related to the recognition of income from the retention of a deposit forfeited by the potential buyer on the potential sale of the property commonly known as the HIT Factory pursuant to a purchase agreement which expired in April 2020.\n(2) Listing expenses include financial advisory and other professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE in August 2020. These costs are non-recurring and are not part of the operations of our real estate portfolio as they were incurred only as a result of our decision to list our Class A common stock on the NYSE.\nCash Net Operating Income\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less income from investment securities and interest, plus general and administrative expenses, acquisition and transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense. In calculating Cash NOI, we also eliminate the effects of straight-lining of rent and the amortization of above- and below-market leases. Cash NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.\nWe use Cash NOI internally as a performance measure and believe Cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe Cash NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe Cash NOI is useful to investors as performance measures because, when compared across periods, Cash NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in\noccupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis. Cash NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and Cash NOI is not affected by whether the financing is at the property level or corporate level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Cash NOI presented by us may not be comparable to Cash NOI reported by other REITs that define Cash NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, Cash NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of Cash NOI for the periods presented.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40,962) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,890) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,112) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>31,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>19,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,294 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, transaction and other costs </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>1,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vesting and conversion of Class B Units </td> <td> </td> <td>1,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>3,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td>(787) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(847) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(444) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset and property management fees to related parties </td> <td> </td> <td>7,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>7,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,958 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of below- and amortization of above-market lease liabilities and assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,026) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,563) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,044) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent (revenues as lessor) </td> <td> </td> <td>(402) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,219) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,544) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line ground rent (expenses as lessee) </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash NOI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,542 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nWe are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. A tax loss for a particular year eliminates the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90% distribution requirement for that year and may minimize or eliminate the need to pay distributions in order to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in 2020 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, from a U.S. federal income tax perspective, 100% of dividends, or $0.04889 per share, represented a return of capital. The dividend declared and paid in January 2021 is a 2021 event for stockholders and the tax treatment of this dividend will be disclosed when information regarding the year ending December 31, 2021 is reported.\nOn February 27, 2018, our board of directors unanimously authorized a suspension of the distributions we pay to the holders of our common stock, effective as of March 1, 2018, and we did not pay distributions during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid distributions to common stockholders of $11.7 million, all of which were paid during the three months ended March 31, 2018, prior to suspending distributions. Of that amount, $4.2 million was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. During January and February 2018, when we were paying distributions, we funded distributions from cash on hand, representing proceeds from secured mortgages financing. In connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we announced that our board of directors intended to reinstate distributions in the form of dividends to our common stockholders in the amount of $0.40 per share of common stock per year. On October 1, 2020, we declared a dividend equal to $0.04889 per share on each share of common stock, which was paid on October 15, 2020. The dividend was calculated to cover the period from August 18, 2020, the date on which shares of Class A common stock commenced trading on the NYSE, through September 30, 2020, based on the previously-announced cash dividend rate equal to $0.40 per share per year. On January 1, 2021, we also declared a dividend equal to $0.10 per share on each share of common stock, which was paid on January 15, 2021.\nDecisions regarding the frequency and amount of any future dividends we pay on our common stock will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend policy at any time and for any reason. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on our ability to operate profitably and to generate sufficient cash flows from the operations of our existing properties and any properties we may acquire. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular basis on our common stock or any other class or series of stock we may issue in the future. Our Board previously suspended and then reinstituted dividends. There is no assurance we will continue to pay dividends. The amount of dividends payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for dividends, our financial condition, provisions in any agreement we are party to that may restrict our ability to pay dividends, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT. Provisions contained in our loan agreements may also impact our ability to pay dividends or make repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows used in operations were $13.6 million. During this period, we paid dividends of $0.6 million. These dividend payments were not funded from cash flows from operations, but rather from available cash on hand consisting of proceeds from financings and sales of real estate investments in prior periods. Funding dividends from these sources reduces the capital available for other requirements, such as capital expenditures at our existing properties, investing in new properties and payment of operating

elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so that we qualify as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner but can provide no assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. A tax loss for a particular year eliminates the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90% distribution requirement for that year and may minimize or eliminate the need to pay distributions in order to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in 2020 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT in 2020.\nInflation\nMany of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nPlease see Note 9 - Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed REIT that invests primarily in office properties located exclusively within the five boroughs of New York City, primarily Manhattan. We have also purchased certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, and may purchase hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types also located exclusively within the five boroughs of New York City. As of December 31, 2020, we owned eight properties consisting of 1,163,061 rentable square feet acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $790.7 million.\nOn August 18, 2020, we listed shares of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. In anticipation of the listing, we implemented a series of corporate actions which resulted in the bifurcation of our common stock into Class A common stock and Class B common stock in a net reduction of 2.43 shares for every one share of common stock outstanding prior to these corporate actions, which we refer to as the Reverse Stock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts as of dates prior to August 5, 2020 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on that date. To effect the listing, and to address the potential for selling pressure that may have existed at the outset of listing, we listed only shares of Class A common stock, which represented approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock, on the NYSE when trading commenced. Our other class of outstanding stock is Class B common stock, which comprised approximately 75% of our outstanding shares of common stock at that time. The first of three equal tranches of shares of Class B common stock that were not listed on the NYSE on the listing date converted into 3,189,204 shares of Class A common stock and the shares were listed on the NYSE on December 16, 2020. Following a determination by our board of directors, the second tranche of shares of Class B common stock converted into 3,176,127 shares of Class A common stock and were listed on the NYSE on March 1, 2021. The remaining tranche of shares of Class B common stock will convert into shares of Class A common stock to be listed on the NYSE on August 13, 2021, unless earlier converted. For additional information, see Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through the OP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our Advisor manages our day-to-day business with the assistance of our Property Manager. Our Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to us. We also reimburse these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to us.\nManagement Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has created several risks and uncertainties that may impact our business, including our future results of operations and our liquidity. A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19 affecting New York City, where we and our tenants operate could have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The ultimate impact on our results of operations, our liquidity and the ability of our tenants to continue to pay us rent will depend on numerous factors including the overall length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management is unable to predict the nature and scope of any of these factors. These factors include the following, among others:\n\u2022The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all. However, we have taken proactive steps with regard to rent collections to mitigate the impact on our business (see -Management Actions\u201d below). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced several lease expirations without renewals as well as terminations, including four during the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, one of our tenants, Knotel, declared bankruptcy in early 2021. Management has already re-leased a portion of the vacant space and is working on securing additional new leases, although there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022There may be a decline in the demand for tenants to lease real estate, as well as a negative impact on rental rates. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio had an occupancy level of 87.0% (80.8% giving effect to the termination of all Knotel's leases with us in January 2021), the weighted-average remaining term of our leases was 7.2 (based on annualized straight-line rent).\n\u2022New York City, where all of our properties are located, has been among the hardest hit locations in the country and until it began its phased reopening in June 2020, which is still underway as of December 31, 2020, operated under a mandatory order under which tenants were required to cease all non-essential in-office functions. Certain restrictions\nhave since been imposed, and there may be further restrictions in the future. Our properties remain accessible to all tenants, although, even as operating restrictions expire, not all tenants have resumed operations. In addition, as New York's phased opening continues, and occupants continue to return to our properties, operating costs may begin to rise, including for services, labor and personal protective equipment and other supplies, as our property managers take appropriate actions to protect tenants and property management personnel. Some of these costs may be recoverable through reimbursement from tenants but others will be borne by us. However, despite the current restrictions and continued reopening, we expect that the mass vaccine rollout will target a return to normalcy\u201d after the summer holidays and will support an uptick in office usage and leasing trends by the end of 2021 and through 2022.\n\u2022Capital market volatility and a tightening of credit standards could negatively impact our ability to obtain debt financing. We do not have any significant debt principal repayments due until 2024.\n\u2022The negative impact of the pandemic on our results of operations and cash flows has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to comply with covenants in our loans. The impact of COVID-19 on our tenants led to early lease terminations and expirations without renewals that caused cash trap events on two of our mortgages as described further in this section.\n\u2022The potential negative impact on the health of personnel of our Advisor, particularly if a significant number of the Advisor's employees are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity.\nFor additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions and may worsen\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Advisor has responded to the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in early March 2020, the Advisor took proactive steps to prepare for and actively mitigate the inevitable disruption COVID-19 would cause, such as, enacting safety measures, both required or recommended by relevant government authorities, including remote working policies, cooperation with localized closure or curfew directives, and social distancing measures at all of our properties. Additionally, there has been no material adverse impact on our financial reporting systems or internal controls and procedures and the Advisor's ability to perform services for us. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are supplementing the historical discussion of our results of operations for the year ended 2020 with a current update on the measures we have taken to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on our business and future results of operations.\nManagement's Actions\nWe have taken several steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business. For rent collections, we have been in direct contact with our tenants since the crisis began, continuing to cultivate open dialogue and deepen the fundamental relationships that we have carefully developed through prior transactions and historic operations. Based on this approach and the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of our tenants, we believe that we have had positive results in our cash rent collections during this pandemic.\nOur portfolio is primarily comprised of office and retail tenants with 78% and 21% of fourth quarter cash rent due from office and retail tenants, respectively. We have collected 86% of fourth quarter cash rent due from our office tenants, 64% of cash rent due from our retail tenants and 82% of cash rent due across our entire portfolio, including 89% of cash rent due from our top ten tenants (based on annualized straight-line rent as of December 31, 2020). The cash rent collected across our entire portfolio was consistent with the third quarter in which we reported total portfolio original cash rent collections of 85% due for the third quarter as of October 31, 2020, which has improved to 86% of third quarter's original cash rent collected as of March 23, 2021. We also reported total portfolio original cash rent collections of 86% due for the second quarter as of October 31, 2020, which remains unchanged as of March 23, 2021. During the fourth quarter, we concluded that it was no longer probable that we would collect substantially all of the amounts due from a number of tenants due to the on-going impacts of COVID. These included most significantly Knotel, a tenant at both our 123 William Street and 9 Times Square properties, as well as several smaller tenants. Accordingly, these tenants were placed on a cash basis and all receivables were fully reserved with additional reserves of $7.4 million ($2.9 million in contract receivables and $4.5 million in straight-line rent receivables) recorded in the fourth quarter.\nThe table below presents additional information on our fourth quarter cash rent collection status and is based on available information as of March 1, 2021.\n\n____________\n(1) Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments thereafter prior to an approved agreement.\n(2) Consists of deferral agreements as well as amendments granting the tenant a rent credit for some portion of cash rent due. The rent credit is generally coupled with an extension of the lease. The terms of the lease amendments providing for rent credits differ by tenant in terms of length and amount of the credit. A deferral agreement is an executed or approved amendment to an existing lease to defer a certain portion of cash rent due. The most common arrangements represent deferral of some or all of the rent due for the second or third quarter of 2020 with such amounts to be paid in 2021.\n(3) Represents active tenant discussions where no approved agreement has yet been reached. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful and will lead to formal agreements on favorable terms, or at all. These amounts are substantially comprised of tenants that were placed on a cash basis, including Knotel which represents 6% of fourth quarter cash rent due, after concluding that it was no longer probable that substantially all amounts due would be collected. We have fully reserved for amounts due from these tenants as a reduction in revenue as of December 31, 2020.\n(4) Consists of tenants who have made a partial payment and/or tenants without active communication on a potential approved agreement. There can be no assurance that such cash rent will be collected. Includes approximately 0.25% of fourth quarter cash rent due from a tenant that was placed on cash basis during the fourth quarter for which we have fully reserved as a reduction in revenue as of December 31, 2020.\nThrough March 23, 2021, we had collected 82% of January 2021 cash rent due and 86% of February 2021 cash rent due (with the increase in February partially due to the fact that Knotel is not included in our rent collection data after January 31, 2021 when all of their leases with us terminated). Fourth quarter rent collections were particularly impacted by the Knotel bankruptcy and a lease amendment with one of our tenants that granted a rent credit of $0.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 in exchange for a 24-month lease extension. Moreover, certain tenants that have entered into agreements with us with respect to second, third or fourth quarter rents have, following the expiration of those agreements, sought to enter into new agreements further deferring or abating rent for additional periods. There can be no assurance additional tenants will not similarly seek future rent relief or that we will be able to collect the cash rent that is due in future months including the deferred 2020 rent amounts due during 2021 under deferral agreements we have entered into with our tenants. Through March 23, 2021, we had collected 25% of January 2021 cash rent due that represented 2020 cash rent that had been deferred until 2021 and 32% of February 2021 cash rent due that represented 2020 cash rent that had been deferred until 2021. We expect this trend of lower collections of amounts previously deferred may continue in future months in 2021. We expect our cash rent collections will stay at current levels and could potentially decline until the New York City economy reopens and recovers sufficiently for our tenants ability to pay rent to improve, although there can be no assurance how long this will take. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the amount of cash rent that we collect going forward cannot be determined at present.\nWe have entered into 18 approved agreements with 11 different tenants that commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020. Under approved agreements entered into during 2020, the total amount deferred was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Under approved agreements entered into during 2020, the total amounts of rent credits (i.e. abatements) was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the critical accounting policies that management believes is important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:\nImpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAs discussed above, we have taken a proactive approach to achieve mutually agreeable solutions with tenants impacted by COVID-19 and in some cases, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, we executed different types of lease amendments. These agreements include deferrals and abatements and also may include extensions to the term of the leases.\nFor accounting purposes, in accordance with ASC 842: Leases, normally a company would be required to assess a lease modification to determine if the lease modification should be treated as a separate lease and if not, modification accounting would be applied which would require a company to reassess the classification of the lease (including leases for which the prior classification under ASC 840 was retained as part of the election to apply the package of practical expedients allowed upon the adoption of ASC 842, which does not apply to leases subsequently modified). However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in\nwhich many leases are being modified, the FASB and SEC have provided relief that allows companies to make a policy election as to whether they treat COVID-19 related lease amendments as a provision included in the pre-concession arrangement, and therefore, not a lease modification, or to treat the lease amendment as a modification. In order to be considered COVID-19 related, cash flows must be substantially the same or less than those prior to the concession. For COVID-19 relief qualified changes, there are two methods to potentially account for such rent deferrals or abatements under the relief, (1) as if the changes were originally contemplated in the lease contract or (2) as if the deferred payments are variable lease payments contained in the lease contract. For all other lease changes that did not qualify for FASB relief, we would be required to apply modification accounting including assessing classification under ASC 842.\nSome, but not all of our lease modifications qualify for the FASB relief. In accordance with the relief provisions, instead of treating these qualifying leases as modifications, we have elected to treat the modifications as if previously contained in the lease and recast rents receivable prospectively (if necessary). Under that accounting, for modifications that were deferrals only, there would be no impact on overall rental revenue and for any abatement amounts that reduced total rent to be received, the impact would be recognized ratably over the remaining life of the lease.\nFor leases not qualifying for this relief, we applied modification accounting and determined that there were no changes in the current classification of its leases impacted by negotiations with its tenants.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue from tenants, which are derived primarily from lease contracts, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. As of December 31, 2020, these leases had an average remaining lease term of 7.2 years. Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires that we record a receivable for, and include in revenue from tenants, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease modification is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. Pursuant to certain of our lease agreements, tenants are required to reimburse us for certain property operating expenses (recorded in total revenue from tenants), in addition to paying base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties. Under ASC 842, we have elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line Revenue from tenants\u201d. For comparative purposes, we have also elected to reflect prior revenue and reimbursements reported under ASC 842 on a single line. For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under both ASC 842 and 840, we have reflected them on a net basis.\nIncluded in revenue from tenants for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $0.1 million of tenant reimbursement related to prior year.\nWe own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets. As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income, until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in contingent rental income is included in revenue from tenants in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rents receivable and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. Under the leasing standard adopted on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion), we are required to assess, based on credit risk, if it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments at the lease commencement date and we must continue to reassess collectability periodically thereafter based on new facts and circumstances affecting the credit risk of the tenant. In fiscal 2020, this assessment has included consideration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our tenant's ability to pay rents in accordance with their contracts. Partial reserves, or the ability to assume partial recovery are no longer permitted. If we determine that it is probable that we will collect virtually all of the lease payments (base rent and additional rent), the lease will continue to be accounted for on an accrual basis (i.e., straight-line). However, if we determine that it is not probable that it will collect virtually all of the lease payments, the lease will be accounted for on a cash basis and a full reserve would be recorded on previously accrued amounts in cases where it was subsequently concluded that collection was not probable. Cost recoveries from tenants are included in revenue from tenants in accordance with current accounting rules, on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.\nIn accordance with the lease accounting rules we record uncollectable amounts as reductions in revenue from tenants. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we reduced revenue from tenants by $8.5 million for reserves recorded during the period on receivables for which the related tenants have been put on a cash basis (see accounting policy above). There were no such reductions recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nAt the time an asset is acquired, we evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of the asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. See the Purchase Price Allocation section below for a discussion of the initial accounting for investments in real estate.\nDisposal of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. No properties were presented as discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale, most significantly that the sale is probable within one year. We evaluate probability of sale based on specific facts including whether a sales agreement is in place and the buyer has made significant non-refundable deposits. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any properties held for sale.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - ASU No. 2016-02 Leases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of our leases as lessor prior to adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019 were accounted for as operating leases and we continued to account for them as operating leases under the transition guidance. We evaluate new leases originated after the adoption date (by us or by a predecessor lessor/owner) pursuant to the new guidance where a lease for some or all of a building is classified by a lessor as a sales-type lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership reside with the tenant. This situation is met if, among other things, there is an automatic transfer of title during the lease, a bargain purchase option, the non-cancelable lease term is for more than major part of remaining economic useful life of the asset (e.g., equal to or greater than 75%), if the present value of the minimum lease payments represents substantially all (e.g., equal to or greater than 90%) of the leased property's fair value at lease inception, or if the asset so specialized in nature that it provides no alternative use to the lessor (and therefore would not provide any future value to the lessor) after the lease term. Further, such new leases would be evaluated to consider whether they would be failed sale-leaseback transactions and accounted for as financing transactions by the lessor. For the three year period ended December 31, 2020, we have no leases as a lessor that would be considered as sales-type leases or financings under sale-leaseback rules.\nWe are also the lessee under a land lease which was previously classified prior to adoption of lease accounting, and will continue to be classified, as operating leases under transition elections unless subsequently modified. These leases are reflected on the balance sheet and the rent expense is reflected on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nIn both a business combination and an asset acquisition, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as if vacant basis. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below- market leases and other identifiable assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests (in a business combination) are recorded at their estimated fair values. In allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates. In a business combination, the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is either recorded as goodwill or as a bargain purchase gain. In an asset acquisition, the difference between the acquisition price (including capitalized transaction costs) and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is allocated to the non-current assets. There were no asset acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were asset acquisitions.\nFor acquired properties with leases classified as operating leases, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nTangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Fair value estimates are also made using significant assumptions such as capitalization rates, discount rates, fair market lease rates and land values per square foot.\nIdentifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates and the value of in-place leases as applicable. Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 24 months. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nAbove-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of its existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. We did not record any intangible asset amounts related to customer relationships recorded in connection with the acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nGain on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nGains on sales of rental real estate after January 1, 2018 are not considered sales to customers and will generally be recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets ( ASC 610-20\u201d).\nGain on sales of real estate prior to January 1, 2018 are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360-20, Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20\u201d). The specific timing of a sale was measured against various criteria in and ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, depending on the circumstances, we may not record a sale or it may record a sale but may defer some or all of the gain recognition. If the criteria for full accrual are not met, we may account for the transaction by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria for the full accrual method are met. We did not have any dispositions during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the property for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If an impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, we would recognize an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss recorded would equal the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net earnings. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nThe value of customer relationship intangibles, if any, is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nAssumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.\nAbove and Below-Market Lease Amortization\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of revenue from tenants over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to revenue from tenants over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. If a tenant with a below-market rent renewal does not renew any remaining unamortized amount will be taken into income at that time.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets. The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.\nWe record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply, or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. If we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any change in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Please see the Results of Operations\u201d section located on page 36 under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our overall portfolio occupancy was 87.0% and 89.6%, respectively. The following table is a summary of our quarterly leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n_______\n(1) Includes new and replacement (for which additional information is provided below) leases commenced during the quarter.\n(2) Represents the GAAP basis annualized straight-line rent that is recognized over the term on the respective leases, includes free rent, periodic rent increases, and excludes recoveries (see -Management's Actions\u201d above).\n(3) The weighted-average remaining lease term (years) is based on annualized straight-line rent.\n(4) Represents leases commenced for spaces that had been previously leased in the prior twelve months, including spaces that were vacant at the time of the\nlease.\n(5) Calculated as of the date of termination for terminated leases and expiration for those leases that have expired.\n(6) Presented as if tenant improvements and leasing commissions were incurred in the period in which the lease commenced, which may be different than the period in which these amounts are actually paid. Does not include tenant improvements and leasing commissions on new leases that are not replacement leases.\nIn addition to the comparative period-over-period discussions below, please see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and management's responses.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to 2019\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned eight properties, comprising of seven properties acquired prior to January 2019 and our 196 Orchard Street property acquired in July 2019 ( 196 Orchard Street\u201d). Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflect changes due to leasing activity and the impact of our acquisition of 196 Orchard Street properties.\nRevenue from Tenants\nRevenue from tenants decreased $7.6 million to $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to reserves of $8.5 million recorded during the period on receivables ($3.0 million of accounts receivables and $5.5 million of straight-line rent receivables) for which the related tenants (including Knotel, but also certain other tenants that continue to occupy the space they have leased from us) have have been put on a cash basis or have terminated their leases early, primarily as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the reserves recorded, $7.5 million was related to receivables from tenants that were put on a cash basis in 2020 and $1.0 million was related to receivables from tenants that terminated their leases early. Of the amount that related to receivables from tenants that were put on cash basis, $1.5 million relates to straight-line rent that would have otherwise been recorded in the fourth quarter. While we have entered into short-term leases with two of Knotel's former tenants at 123 William Street that collectively represent over 23,400 square feet and we are working to find new tenants to replace Knotel and to increase the rental income at our properties through leasing activity, there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all. There was also a decrease in reimbursable operating expenses, such as utilities, due to fewer tenants working at the properties during the period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe decreases to our year-over-year revenue from tenants were partially offset by the incremental impact of a full year of revenue from tenants in 2020 from our 196 Orchard Street acquisition (acquired in July 2019) and the write-off of below-market lease intangibles in connection with leases terminated during the current year.\nAsset and Property Management Fees to Related Parties\nWe incurred $7.6 million and $7.3 million in fees for asset and property management services to our Advisor and Property Manager for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This is primarily related to the impact of property management fees due to the Property Manager that are no longer adjusted for reimbursable expenses paid by us to third-party property managers beginning on April 1, 2019. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in property management fees due to the calculation being based on cash receipts, which decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on fees incurred to our Advisor and Property Manager.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased $1.1 million to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in condominium fees and property taxes, which were previously directly paid by certain tenants that stopped paying these obligations under their leases and we expect will continue to be paid by us while these tenants are not paying rent. In addition, the increase to our property operating expenses was impacted by the incremental effect of a full year of property operating expenses in 2020 from our 196 Orchard Street acquisition (acquired in July 2019).\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nWe incurred no acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $13,000 of acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nListing Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $1.3 million of expenses associated with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE.\nVesting and Conversion of Class B Units\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash expense of $1.2 million related to the vesting and conversion of Class B Units. The vesting conditions relating to the Class B Units were fully satisfied upon completion of the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. On the listing date, 65,498 Class B Units were converted into Class A Units, of which 52,398 held by the Advisor were subsequently redeemed for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation increased $3.8 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $86,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the recording of $3.8 million of expense related to the 2020 OPP as well as amortization related to restricted shares of common stock. Approximately $0.1 million of expense was recorded for the amortization of restricted shares of common stock. See Note 11 - Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the 2020 OPP and restricted shares of common stock.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased legal and audit fees. Legal fees increased due to legal costs associated with negotiating with our tenants as a result of COVID-19 and expenses incurred associated with the tender offer for shares of Class B common stock completed in January 2021, as well as costs associated with capital-raising and other activity related to the Listing.\nTotal reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services provided by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3.6 million, of which $1.0 million related to administrative and overhead expenses and $2.6 million were for salaries, wages, and benefits. This is compared to $3.2 million of reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services for the year ended December 31, 2019. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses and reimbursements for salaries, wages, and benefits are subject to an annual limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the annual limits on reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses on and for salaries, wages, and benefit were reached. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also received a credit of $0.4 million relating to a change in estimate for previously paid 2019 bonuses. The limit on reimbursement for salaries, wages and benefits was evaluated without regard to our 2019 bonus reimbursement from the Advisor. On a combined basis, giving effect to the credit, our reimbursements to our Advisor were approximately the same year over year. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $0.5 million to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an out-of-period charge of $0.3 million in 2020 (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and due to a higher depreciable asset base as a result of the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street completed in July 2019 and the net effect of fixed and intangible asset write-offs associated with lease terminations recorded during the current year. As a result of the termination of our leases with Knotel effective January 31, 2021 following Knotel's filing for bankruptcy earlier that month, we will write-off all related intangibles, including an estimated $1.3 million of deferred leasing costs, which will be included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.9 million to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to loans we entered into in April 2019 secured by 9 Times Square and July 2019 in connection with the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street (see Note 4 - Mortgage Notes Payable, Net to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). During the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted-average outstanding debt balance was $405.0 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our weighted average outstanding debt balance was $359.9 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%.\nOther Income\nOther income remained consistent at $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Approximately $0.7 million of the other income in 2020 is related to the recognition of income from the retention of a deposit forfeited by the buyer on the potential sale of the property commonly known as the HIT Factory\u201d under a purchase agreement which expired in April 2020. This increase was partially offset by a decline in interest income on invested cash due to a decline in rates.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the restricted cash we are required to maintain, the timing of interest payments, the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.6 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of $41.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $35.3 million, including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion/amortization of below market and above market lease liabilities and assets and share-based compensation, as well as the vesting and conversion of Class B Units. Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash outflows of $7.4 million for an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, $0.3 million for a net increase in straight-line receivables and $0.5 million related to a decrease related to accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with operating activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by a $0.3 million increase related to additional deferred (prepaid rent) revenue.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million which consisted of a net loss of $21.9 million, and, after adjustments for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets and other non-cash expenses of $31.0 million, resulted in cash inflows of $9.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities also included net cash outflow of $1.5 million for a decrease in rent payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates and a decrease in other liabilities of $2.1 million for a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These operating cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.0 million primarily related to unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis, payment of real estate taxes and deferred leasing costs.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.8 million related to the funding of capital expenditures relating to tenant and building improvements at 9 Times Square, 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $46.0 million related to capital expenditures of $7.7 million primarily due to building and tenant improvements at 9 Times Square, 123 William Street and 1140 Avenue of the Americas and $38.3 million due to the acquisition of 196 Orchard Street in July 2019.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the redemption of fractional shares of common stock of $0.3 million and restricted shares following the Reverse Stock Split that occurred on August 5, 2020 as well as dividends paid on common stock of $0.6 million in October 2020 (see Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $55.0 million, partially offset by payments of $3.9 million relating to financing costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for cash are to fund operating and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to our properties, our debt service obligations and, subject to capital availability, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $31.0 million as compared to $39.1 million as of September 30, 2020 and $51.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Under the guarantee of certain enumerated recourse liabilities of the borrower under one of our mortgage loans, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth in excess of $175.0 million and minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of $10.0 million.\nOur principal sources of cash in recent periods have been the net cash, if any, provided by our current property operations and cash on hand consisting primarily of proceeds from financings of then-unencumbered assets. In some recent periods, including the fourth quarter and full year 2020, the net cash provided by our property operations has not alone been sufficient to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all, which has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the amount of cash we receive from our operations and therefore our ability to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements, which, beginning in October 2020, include dividends to our common stockholders. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, as described in more detail below, the operating results at 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square properties were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic leading to early lease terminations and expirations without renewals that caused cash trap events under the non-recourse mortgages for those properties to be triggered. Specifically for these properties, there were early lease terminations, expirations without renewal and a tenant bankruptcy for a significant tenant in the 9 Times Square property (Knotel). As a result, at these properties, which together represent 61% of the rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, we will not be able to use excess cash flow from the properties to fund operating expenses at our other properties and other capital requirements until the breaches have been cured.\nIn addition to the discussion below, see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for additional information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and management's actions taken in response. Due to rent deferrals and the other impacts of COVID-19, as well as the terms of our leases, we anticipate we may continue to fund a portion of our operating expenses and other capital requirements with cash on hand through at least the first half of 2021. We do not have any significant debt principal repayments due until 2024, and we believe that we will have sufficient cash available to us to meet our operating cash requirements over the next year. We expect to fund our future capital needs, including for acquisitions or share repurchases, if authorized, through a combination of net cash, if any, provided by our current property operations, or the operations of properties that we may acquire in the future, proceeds from property dispositions (if any) and proceeds from our Common Stock ATM Program (as defined below) or other future equity offerings and debt financings.\nMortgage Loans\nWe have six mortgage loans secured by seven of our eight properties with an aggregate balance of $405.0 million as of December 31, 2020 with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.35%. We do not currently have a commitment for a corporate-level revolving credit facility or any other corporate-level indebtedness, and there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain corporate-level financing on favorable terms, or at all. Our only asset that is not serving as collateral for a mortgage is 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory, which is unoccupied and therefore unlikely to be accepted as collateral for a new mortgage loan. See -Acquisitions and Dispositions\u201d section below for further detail on this property. We do not currently anticipate incurring additional indebtedness secured by our existing properties, however, despite a tightening of the credit markets, we expect to be able to continue to use debt financing as a source of capital to the extent we acquire additional properties.\nWe do not have principal payments due on our mortgage notes payable for the year ending December 31, 2021.\nWe have been in breach of a debt service coverage provision and a reserve fund reserve provision under the non-recourse mortgage loan with $99.0 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 secured by the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property for the last two quarters. These breaches are not events of default, rather they require excess cash (after payment of operating costs, debt service and capital/tenant replacement reserves) to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants for this loan may be cured after achieving two consecutive quarters when the required debt service coverage for the property is maintained, whereupon the additional collateral will be released. Currently, we have not cured the breaches through these or any other means. We do not expect similar amounts to be trapped in future periods in the short-term as we expect there will be little to no excess cash flow at the two properties after paying property expenses, interest and capital expenditure. As of December 31, 2020, we have $2.9 million cash trapped and maintained in restricted cash associated with this event. This restricted cash is not available to be used for other corporate purposes. We can remain subject to this reserve requirement through maturity of the loan without causing an event of default under loan that could give rise to the lenders' right to accelerate the principal amount due under the loan or further penalty or ramifications.\nWe are also currently in breach of a debt service coverage and debt yield covenants under the non-recourse mortgage loan with $55.0 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 secured by the 9 Times Square property as of the year ended December 31, 2020. These breaches were caused by the January 2021 bankruptcy of one of our tenants, Knotel, a co-working company that was previously the second largest tenant in our portfolio based on annualized straight-line rent as of September 30, 2020. These breaches are not events of default, but rather require us to enter into a cash management period whereby all rents and other revenue of the property are to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants may be cured after achieving two consecutive quarters when the required debt service coverage and debt yield for the property is maintained. We may remain in breach of the covenants for up to four consecutive quarters, after which an event of default could occur that could give the lenders the right to accelerate the principal amount due under the loan and other remedies.\nWhile we have entered into short-term leases with two of Knotel's former tenants at 123 William Street that collectively represent over 23,400 square feet and we are working to find new tenants to replace Knotel and to increase the rental income at our 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square properties through leasing activity, there can be no assurance we will be able to lease all or any portion of our currently vacant space at any property on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all. Unless we are able to enter into new leases at both the properties on terms that allow us to cure the breach, we will be unable to access excess cash flow from either property. If we experience additional lease terminations, due to tenant bankruptcies or otherwise, it is possible that certain of the covenants on other loans may be breached and we may also become restricted from accessing excess cash flows from those properties. We were in compliance with the remaining covenants under our mortgage notes payable as of December 31, 2020.\nCommon Stock ATM Program\nOn October 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, offer, issue and sell to the public, through our sales agents, shares of Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million in an at the market\u201d equity offering program (the Common Stock ATM Program\u201d). Under SEC rules,\nas long as the aggregate market value of our outstanding Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, remains below $75.0 million, the maximum aggregate offering amount of the shares sold pursuant to the Common Stock ATM Program will be $18.7 million. Following the conversion of an additional 3,174,760 shares of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock on March 1, 2021, our public float has increased and we expect we will be able to offer and sell shares in excess of $18.7 million once we file a new prospectus supplement with the SEC. We have not yet sold any shares of Class A common stock through the Common Stock ATM Program.\nRepurchase Program\nOur board of directors has adopted a resolution authorizing consideration of share repurchases of up to $100.0 million of shares of Class A common stock over a long-term period following the listing of our Class common stock on the NYSE. Actual repurchases would be reviewed and approved by our board of directors based on management recommendations taking into consideration all information available at the specific time including our available cash resources (including the ability to borrow), market capitalization, trading price and alternative uses such as acquisitions. Repurchases would typically be made on the open market in accordance with SEC rules creating a safe harbor for issuer repurchases but may also occur in privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2020, no shares had been repurchased by us under this program. As of December 31, 2020, we also had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $31.0 million. We are also subject to a covenant under one of our mortgage loans requiring us to maintain minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of $10.0 million. See Item 1.A. Risk Factors - Our ability to fund our capital requirements will depend on, among other things, the amount of cash we are able to generate from our operations and outside sources, which may not be available on acceptable or favorable terms, or at all.\u201d\nLeasing Activity/Occupancy\nWe had an occupancy level of 87.0% across our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as compared to 89.6% as of December 31, 2019. The significant year-over-year occupancy changes were as follows:\n\u2022Occupancy at 9 Times Square decreased to 78.7% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 90.1% last year. The decrease was due to the termination or expiration of seven leases, which caused leased square footage to decrease by approximately 20,000 square feet, with no new leases commenced during the year.\n\u2022Occupancy at 123 William Street was 90.3% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 92.5% last year. The decrease was due to the termination or expiration of four leases during the year, which was offset by the commencement of a new lease in one space, and caused a net decrease in leased square footage of approximately 12,000 square feet as compared to December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, occupancy includes the leased space occupied by one of our tenants, Knotel, which is a tenant at both our 9 Times Square and 123 William Street properties. In January 2021, Knotel filed for bankruptcy and all leases were terminated effective January 31, 2020. If Knotel was not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2020, occupancy for 9 Times Square would have been 57.7%, occupancy for 123 William Street would have been 83.6% and occupancy across our portfolio would have been 80.8%. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we put certain tenants on a cash basis and fully reserved certain receivables and reflected this as a reduction in revenue from tenants during the period. For additional information on our accounting policy related to revenue recognition, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Polices to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, for a discussion of overall impact on our result of operations for this and other reserves and write-offs for tenant receivables recorded in 2020 and for additional information on leasing activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Results of Operations section located in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nWe continue to focus on increasing occupancy of the portfolio by seeking replacement tenants for leases that had expired or otherwise have been terminated. We believe that certain market tenant incentives we have used and expect to continue to use, including free rent periods and tenant improvements, will support our occupancy rate and extend the average duration of our leases upon commencement of executed leases. While we do not receive cash during initial free rent periods, which has impacted and may continue to impact the net cash provided by our property operations in recent periods adversely, we believe this helps position us to negotiate longer, more attractive lease terms by having the flexibility to include such a feature.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 we funded $3.8 million of capital expenditures primarily related to tenant improvements at our 123 William Street, 9 Times Square and 1140 Avenue of the Americas properties. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.7 million were primarily related to tenant improvements at our 123 William Street, 9 Times Square, and 1140 Avenue of the Americas properties. We may invest in additional capital expenditures to further enhance the value of our properties. Additionally, many of our lease agreements with tenants include provisions for tenant improvement allowances. The amount we invest in capital expenditures during 2021, including amounts we are, or expect to be, contractually obligated to fund under new or replacement leases, will likely be less than the amount invested in\n2020. We funded our capital expenditures during 2020 from cash on hand consisting of proceeds from financings and sales of real estate investments in prior periods, and expect to fund any future capital expenditures with available cash on hand and potential future financings. The recent economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted and could continue to impact our decisions on the amount and timing of future capital expenditures.\nTender Offer\nIn December 2020, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 65,000 shares of Class B common stock for cash at a purchase price equal to $7.00 per share. In February 2021, we purchased approximately 26,236 shares of Class B common stock following the expiration of the tender offer for a total cost to us of approximately $0.2 million, including fees and expenses relating to the tender offer, which was funded with cash on hand.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nWe had no acquisitions or dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe also continue to evaluate our strategic alternatives for our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property, where the sole tenant terminated its lease early and vacated the space during the second quarter of 2018. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of this property for a contract price of $7.1 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the buyer terminated the transaction and we retained the security deposit of $0.7 million. There can be no assurance we will be able to find a replacement buyer or a new tenant or as to how much, if any, liquidity we will be able to generate from this property. Moreover, because the property is unoccupied, it does not generate any revenues that offset the cost of owning and maintaining the property.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis section discusses the non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our performance, including Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and Cash Net Operating Income ( Cash NOI\u201d). A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided below.\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a performance measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper and approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper\u201d). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gain and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities (including our OP) and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates are made to arrive at our proportionate share of FFO attributable to our stockholders. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nCore Funds from Operations\nBeginning in the third quarter 2020, following the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we began presenting Core FFO as a non-GAAP metric. We have presented prior periods on a comparable basis so that the metric is useful to the users of our financial statements. We believe that Core FFO is utilized by other publicly-traded REITs although Core FFO presented by us may not be comparable to Core FFO reported by other REITs that define Core FFO differently. In calculating\nCore FFO, we start with FFO, then we exclude the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our real estate operating portfolio, which is our core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating items include acquisition and transaction related costs for dead deals, debt extinguishment costs, listing related costs and expenses (including the vesting and conversion of Class B Units and cash expenses and fees which are non-recurring in nature incurred in connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE and related transactions), and non-cash equity-based compensation. We add back non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred with the early extinguishment of debt which are included in net income but are considered financing cash flows when paid in the statement of cash flows. We consider these write-offs and prepayment penalties to be capital transactions and not indicative of operations. By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction dead deal costs as well as non-operating costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nAccounting Treatment of Rent Deferrals\nThe majority of the concessions granted to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are rent deferrals or temporary rent abatements with the original lease term unchanged and collection of deferred rent deemed probable (see the Overview - Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information). As a result of relief granted by the FASB and the SEC related to lease modification accounting, rental revenue used to calculate Net Income, NAREIT FFO and Core FFO have not been, and we do not expect it to be, significantly impacted by these types of deferrals. For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy, including details related to the relief granted by the FASB and SEC, see Note 2 - Significant Accounting Polices to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of FFO and Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 and presents the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 on a comparable basis:\n\n___________\n(1) Included in Net loss, FFO and Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 is other income of approximately $0.7 million related to the recognition of income from the retention of a deposit forfeited by the potential buyer on the potential sale of the property commonly known as the HIT Factory pursuant to a purchase agreement which expired in April 2020.\n(2) Listing expenses include financial advisory and other professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE in August 2020. These costs are non-recurring and are not part of the operations of our real estate portfolio as they were incurred only as a result of our decision to list our Class A common stock on the NYSE.\nCash Net Operating Income\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less income from investment securities and interest, plus general and administrative expenses, acquisition and transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense. In calculating Cash NOI, we also eliminate the effects of straight-lining of rent and the amortization of above- and below-market leases. Cash NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.\nWe use Cash NOI internally as a performance measure and believe Cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe Cash NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe Cash NOI is useful to investors as performance measures because, when compared across periods, Cash NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in\noccupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis. Cash NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and Cash NOI is not affected by whether the financing is at the property level or corporate level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Cash NOI presented by us may not be comparable to Cash NOI reported by other REITs that define Cash NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, Cash NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of Cash NOI for the periods presented.\n\nDividends\nWe are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. A tax loss for a particular year eliminates the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90% distribution requirement for that year and may minimize or eliminate the need to pay distributions in order to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in 2020 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, from a U.S. federal income tax perspective, 100% of dividends, or $0.04889 per share, represented a return of capital. The dividend declared and paid in January 2021 is a 2021 event for stockholders and the tax treatment of this dividend will be disclosed when information regarding the year ending December 31, 2021 is reported.\nOn February 27, 2018, our board of directors unanimously authorized a suspension of the distributions we pay to the holders of our common stock, effective as of March 1, 2018, and we did not pay distributions during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid distributions to common stockholders of $11.7 million, all of which were paid during the three months ended March 31, 2018, prior to suspending distributions. Of that amount, $4.2 million was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. During January and February 2018, when we were paying distributions, we funded distributions from cash on hand, representing proceeds from secured mortgages financing. In connection with the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we announced that our board of directors intended to reinstate distributions in the form of dividends to our common stockholders in the amount of $0.40 per share of common stock per year. On October 1, 2020, we declared a dividend equal to $0.04889 per share on each share of common stock, which was paid on October 15, 2020. The dividend was calculated to cover the period from August 18, 2020, the date on which shares of Class A common stock commenced trading on the NYSE, through September 30, 2020, based on the previously-announced cash dividend rate equal to $0.40 per share per year. On January 1, 2021, we also declared a dividend equal to $0.10 per share on each share of common stock, which was paid on January 15, 2021.\nDecisions regarding the frequency and amount of any future dividends we pay on our common stock will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend policy at any time and for any reason. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on our ability to operate profitably and to generate sufficient cash flows from the operations of our existing properties and any properties we may acquire. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular basis on our common stock or any other class or series of stock we may issue in the future. Our Board previously suspended and then reinstituted dividends. There is no assurance we will continue to pay dividends. The amount of dividends payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for dividends, our financial condition, provisions in any agreement we are party to that may restrict our ability to pay dividends, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT. Provisions contained in our loan agreements may also impact our ability to pay dividends or make repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows used in operations were $13.6 million. During this period, we paid dividends of $0.6 million. These dividend payments were not funded from cash flows from operations, but rather from available cash on hand consisting of proceeds from financings and sales of real estate investments in prior periods. Funding dividends from these sources reduces the capital available for other requirements, such as capital expenditures at our existing properties, investing in new properties and payment of operating expenses.\nThe following table shows the sources for the payment of dividends to holders of common stock and distributions to holders of LTIP Units for the periods indicated:\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\n\nElection as a REIT\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so that we qualify as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner but can provide no assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. A tax loss for a particular year eliminates the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90% distribution requirement for that year and may minimize or eliminate the need to pay distributions in order to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in 2020 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT in 2020.\nInflation\nMany of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nPlease see Note 9 - Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.", "item_7_tables": "Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the management's discussion and analysis:\n\nOverview\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has created economic uncertainty and risks including lower rent payments from tenants, declines in demand for office space, and tightening credit markets. Management has taken steps to mitigate these impacts such as rent deferrals/abatements with tenants and efforts to reduce costs.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Revenue from tenants decreased in 2020 primarily due to $8.5M in reserves on receivables from tenants put on cash basis or terminating early, largely due to COVID-19 impacts. This was partially offset by a full year of revenue from the 196 Orchard St acquisition.\n- Property operating expenses increased due to higher condo fees and property taxes. \n- Listing expenses of $1.3M were incurred related to the NYSE listing in August 2020.\n- Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $41.0M in 2020 compared to $21.9M in 2019.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Cash flows from operations were negative $13.6M in 2020. The company has not yet utilized its $250M \"at the market\" equity program.\n- The company was in breach of certain debt covenants at two properties (1140 Avenue of the Americas and 9 Times Square) due to COVID-19 impacts, requiring additional collateral to be posted.\n- Occupancy was 87.0% at December 31, 2020 compared to 89.6% at December 31, 2019.\n\nDividends\n- Dividends of $0.6M were paid in 2020 following the resumption of dividends in October 2020. Dividends were funded from available cash on hand, not operating cash flows.\n\nThe analysis also discusses inflation, related party transactions, contractual obligations, and election as a REIT."}
