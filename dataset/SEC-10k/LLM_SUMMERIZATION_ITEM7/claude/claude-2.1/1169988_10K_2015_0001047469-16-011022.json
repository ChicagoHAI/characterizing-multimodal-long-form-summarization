MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe believe we are the leading global provider of commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services for carriers. Our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global Wi-Fi networks that cover more than 1.5 million hotspots. We manage and operate an indoor DAS network, which contains 10,900 nodes. Our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners.\nWe grew revenue from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%. We grew revenue from $106.7 million in 2013 to $119.3 million in 2014, an increase of 11.8%. We generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $22.3 million in 2015 compared to $19.5 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA increased from $20.3 million in 2014 to $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0%. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nThe proliferation of smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, the internet of things (\"IoT\") and other Wi-Fi enabled devices-in conjunction with the increased consumption of high-bandwidth activities like streaming media, cloud-based applications, and online gaming and mobile apps-has created a demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet access in public places both large and small. These data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile Internet data traffic that is expected to increase nearly eightfold between 2015 and 2020, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index. We believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill, measuring recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from several sources including: (i) retail and military customers under subscription plans for month-to-month network access that automatically renew, and retail and military single-use access from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access plans, (ii) DAS customers that are telecom operators under long-term contracts for access to our DAS at our managed and operated locations, (iii) arrangements with wholesale Wi-Fi customers that provide software licensing, network access, and/or professional services fees, and (iv) display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign-in pages. Software licensed by our wholesale Wi-Fi platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is presented net of any sales and value added taxes.\nSubscription fees from retail and military customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance. We provide refunds for our retail and military services on a case-by-case basis. These amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra-revenue in the period the refunds are made. Subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue generated from retail and military single-use access is recognized when access is provided.\nRevenue generated from access to our DAS networks consists of build-out fees and recurring access fees under certain long-term contracts with telecom operators. Build-out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period, once the build-out is complete. Periodically, we install and sell Wi-Fi and DAS networks to customers where we do not have service contracts or remaining obligations beyond the installation of those networks and we recognize build-out fees for such projects as revenue when the installation work is completed and the network has been accepted by the customer. Minimum monthly access fees for usage of the DAS networks are non-cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis. These minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the telecom operator agreement. The initial term of our contracts with telecom operators generally range from five to twenty years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue from DAS network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned.\nServices provided to wholesale Wi-Fi partners generally contain several elements including: (i) a term license to use our software to access our Wi-Fi network, (ii) access fees for Wi-Fi network usage, and/or (iii) professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the Wi-Fi service. The term license, monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates. Once the term license for integration and customization are delivered, the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement. The initial term of the license agreements is generally between one to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue for Wi-Fi network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned. All elements within existing service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement.\nIn instances where the minimum monthly Wi-Fi and DAS network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement, an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected.\nWe adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (\"ASU 2009-13\"), on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements, as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under ASC 605-25, we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. We recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is generated from advertisements on our managed and operated or partner networks. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer-specific agreement. Obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of units or the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. Advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on management's estimates of revenue and operating expenses, (ii) long- term growth rates, (iii) an appropriate discount rate and (iv) an appropriate royalty rate, where applicable. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the market, with adjustments relating to any differences between the assets. The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at prices at the time of the acquisition reduced for depreciation of the asset.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We perform our impairment test annually as of December 31st. Entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If, after assessing qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we tested our goodwill for impairment using a market based approach and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. To date, we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nWe perform an impairment review of long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and/or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value. We would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), which are granted to employees and non-employees. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis, net of estimated and actual forfeitures, over the employee requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met. The grant date fair value of our stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rates are primarily affected by changes in our valuation allowances, the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits, the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. In 2014, we updated our presentation of revenue sources to differentiate our individual users based on the nature of the users-retail users who purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations or military users who purchase Internet access or IPTV services for individual use on military bases. Accordingly, we have disaggregated our subscribers between our retail and military users. We have also removed monthly churn, which was defined as the number of subscribers who canceled their subscriptions in a given month, expressed as a percentage of the average subscribers in that month, as a key performance indicator as we no longer view monthly churn as a key business metric. Our key performance indicators follow:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>308 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-military\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connects\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DAS nodes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscribers-retail and subscribers-military. This metric represents the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end.\nConnects. This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include retail and wholesale customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network.\nDAS nodes. This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of retail revenue, military revenue, DAS revenue, wholesale revenue, and advertising and other revenue. In 2014, we updated our presentation of revenue sources to provide increased visibility into the revenue streams that are the focus of our current and future operational and development efforts. Our retail revenue sources were previously differentiated based on our retail\nplan types-subscription or single-use. We believe that it is more relevant to differentiate our individual users based on the nature of the users-retail users who purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations or military users who purchase Internet access and/or IPTV services for individual use on military bases. We also previously combined our wholesale DAS and Wi-Fi revenues and we believe that it is better to disaggregate these wholesale product revenues going forward by DAS and Wi-Fi given the current development of these products.\nRetail and military. We generate revenue from sales to retail and military individuals of month-to-month network access subscriptions that automatically renew, primarily through charge card transactions. We also generate revenue from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access to retail and military individuals primarily through charge card transactions.\nDAS. We generate revenue from telecom operator partners that pay us network build-out fees, inclusive of network upgrades, and access fees for our DAS networks.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. We generate revenue from wholesale Wi-Fi partners that license our software and pay usage-based monthly network access fees to allow their customers to access our global Wi-Fi network. Usage-based network access fees may be measured in minutes, connects, megabytes or gigabytes, and in most cases are subject to minimum volume commitments. Other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us monthly fees to provide a Wi-Fi infrastructure that we install, manage and operate at their venues for their customers under a service provider arrangement.\nAdvertising and other. We generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors to our landing pages at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs and at locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, we receive revenue from partners in certain venues where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 17% and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, two groups of entities affiliated with Verizon Communications, Inc. and AT&T Inc. each accounted for 14% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe classify our costs and operating expenses as network access, network operations, development and technology, selling and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Network access costs consist primarily of payments to venues and network partners in our network. Other costs and operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for contracted labor and development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. Facilities costs are generally allocated based on headcount. Depreciation and amortization expenses associated with specifically identifiable property and equipment are allocated to the appropriate expense categories.\nNetwork access. Network access costs consist of revenue share payments to venue owners where our managed and operated hotspots are located, usage-based fees to our roaming network partners for access to their networks, depreciation of equipment related to network build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, sale of equipment, and bandwidth and other Internet connectivity expenses in our managed and operated locations.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses consist of costs for our customer service department and for our operations staff that designs, builds, monitors and maintains the network. Also\nincluded are expenses for our customer service provider that handles customer care inquiries and expenses for network operations contractors, equipment depreciation and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses consist of costs for our product development and engineering departments, developers and our information systems services staff, depreciation of our equipment and internal-use software, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs for our business development and marketing employees and executives, travel and entertainment and marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of costs for our executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, as well as legal, accounting, tax and other professional service fees. Also included are other corporate expenses such as charge card processing fees and bad debt expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of acquired venue contracts, technology and non-compete agreements.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, primarily consist of interest income and expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2013, we established a full valuation allowance as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized and we have continued to maintain the full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In 2013, income tax expense included $2.4 million of tax expense related to increases in our valuation allowance. $1.9 million of the increase relates to additional valuation allowances that were established as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are comprised of minority holdings by third parties in our subsidiaries Chicago Concourse Development Group, LLC (\"CCDG\") and Boingo Holding Participacoes Ltda. (\"BHPL\").\nWe are generally required to pay a portion of allocated net profits less capital expenditures of the preceding year to the non-controlling interest holders of CCDG. The limited liability company agreement for CCDG does not have a term. CCDG can be dissolved upon the unanimous agreement of the members, upon the sale of CCDG, upon declaration of bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the license agreement between CCDG and the City of Chicago.\nWe attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in BHPL under the terms of the limited liability company agreement in proportion to their holdings. The limited liability company agreement with BHPL does not have a term. We, by resolution of the members, may distribute profits against retained earnings or profit reserves existing on the most recent annual balance sheet or may draw up financial statements and distribute profits in shorter periods. BHPL can be dissolved by resolution of the members and as otherwise provided for by law.\nPrior to August 4, 2015, we also had a 70% ownership of Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC (\"CCG Detroit\"). On August 4, 2015, we purchased the remaining 30% ownership interest from the non-controlling interest owners for $1.2 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of the remaining interest of an entity that had already been majority-owned by the Company. The purchase resulted in a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $1.2 million representing excess purchase price over the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests. In prior years, we attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in CCG Detroit under the terms of the limited liability company agreement. CCG Detroit had generated losses, which had reduced the non-controlling owners capital account to zero in 2009, resulting in an allocation to the controlling interest holder of all operating losses and deficits created by fixed distributions to the non-controlling interest holder. The fixed distributions were terminated during September 2013 concurrent with the termination of CCG Detroit's agreement with Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nResults of Operations\nThe

in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from our increased fixed assets for our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development in those periods.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million, or 31.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods as\nwell as $1.0 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 resulting from a change in the expected service period for one of our executives, who was terminated. Under the terms of the executive's employment agreement, the executive received 12 months of accelerated vesting credit on unvested stock-based awards. Stock-based compensation expense increased $2.7 million, or 59.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods. We have shifted our stock-based compensation from stock options to RSUs, which generally vest over a specified service period. We also issue performance-based RSUs to executive personnel. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

DAS revenue increased $8.2 million, or 21.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $6.1 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, which includes a $1.0 million short-term build-out project that included the sale of equipment that was completed during 2015, and a $2.1 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. The increase in access fees resulted primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed and $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 21.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers in 2015 compared to 2014. The remaining decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $6.7 million, or 44.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in Wi-Fi build-out revenues related to a project that was completed in 2014.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $15.4 million, or 343.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in subscribers resulting from our build-out of Wi-Fi networks at military bases.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in revenues from other service agreements.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>161,257 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137,323 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense and a $3.6 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs, which is inclusive of a $0.6 million increase in costs directly related to our short-term DAS and Wi-Fi build-out projects. The increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which included a one-time $1.9 million cost incurred in 2014 to terminate one of our venue contracts, and a $0.3 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.9 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in network maintenance and connectivity expenses, a $0.4 million increase in call center costs, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in other operating expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $4.3 million, or 28.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.6 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in hardware and software maintenance and other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.3 million, or 20.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.2 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.4 million one-time charge for salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for one of our executives who was terminated, and a $0.7 million increase in other marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million, or 28.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount, a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in business licenses, taxes, and insurance, a $0.5 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $1.4 million increase in rent and other general and administrative expenses.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014. In 2015, we incurred and capitalized $0.6 million of interest expense related to our Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2015, as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate decreased to 2.2% for 2015, as compared to 3.9% in 2014.\nOur future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as our level of future taxable income, tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre-tax income. We do not expect to incur any significant income taxes until such time that we reverse our valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets upon return to sustained profitability.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased $0.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of decreased net income for a subsidiary resulting from the transition of the managed and operated venues of this subsidiary from an end-user paid to a tiered pricing model.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the $23.9 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $20.3 million increase in revenues, the $0.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0% from $20.3 million recorded in 2014. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 21.2% in 2015, up from 17.0% of revenue in 2014. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by the $2.8 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders, the $0.6 million decrease in non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-controlling interests and interest and other expense (income), net.

Retail revenue decreased $2.9 million, or 6.6%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers. Our average revenue per retail subscriber remained essentially the same in 2014 as compared to 2013. The remaining decrease was attributable to a $0.6 million decrease in retail single-use revenue resulting from the transition of certain paid managed and operated locations to a tiered or free pricing model. Retail revenue for 2014 and 2013 includes $2.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of retail single-use revenue related to venues acquired from AWG in October 2013.\nDAS. DAS revenue increased $5.6 million, or 17.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $3.3 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations and a $2.3 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators resulting primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue decreased $2.1 million, or 11.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $3.5 million decrease in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in wholesale service provider revenues resulting from increased deployments and $0.7 million in revenue from a Wi-Fi build-out project that was completed in 2014.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $3.2 million, or 256.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013 due to deployments of our Wi-Fi and IPTV networks at military bases during 2014.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue increased $8.7 million, or 70.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $9.3 million increase in the volume of advertising sales at our managed and operated locations. The increase was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in other revenues. Advertising revenue for 2014 and 2013 includes $8.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of advertising sales at the venues acquired from AWG in October 2013.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>47,245 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137,323 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>108,640 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $12.2 million, or 25.8%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. The increase is primarily attributed to a $9.2 million increase in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which includes a one-time $1.9 million cost to terminate one of our venue contracts, a $5.4 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $3.2 million increase in internet connectivity expenses. The increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues and a $2.5 million decrease in other direct costs. Other direct costs for 2014 include $0.4 million of costs related to a Wi-Fi build out project.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $7.1 million, or 38.4%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.6 million increase in depreciation expense, a $0.6 million increase in network maintenance expenses, a $0.3 million increase in travel and entertainment expenses, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, a $0.3 million increase in call center expenses, and a $0.1 million increase in rent and other expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $3.4 million, or 30.2%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $0.7 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, a $0.4 million impairment loss related to a change in the use of certain software developed for internal use, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.5 million increase in other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $2.1 million, or 15.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount and higher sales commissions related to our increased advertising sales. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 15.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $1.8 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $1.0 million increase in stock- based compensation expenses, a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in rent and facilities expenses. General and administrative expenses includes a $0.5 million impairment loss related to a venue termination agreement that resulted in the abandonment of our Wi-Fi network assets and the release of the corresponding capital lease obligations associated with those assets. General and administrative expenses also includes a $0.8 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisition of Endeka Group, Inc. (\"Endeka\") in February 2013.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $1.5 million, or 65.2%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due primarily to our acquisitions of Endeka and AWG in February 2013 and October 2013, respectively. For future years, amortization expense is expected to be $3.5 million for 2015, $3.5 million for 2016, $3.2 million for 2017, $2.4 million for 2018, $1.6 million for 2019 and $5.5 million thereafter.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, decreased $0.1 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to our lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2014 as compared to 2013 and interest expense related to our new Credit Agreement, which we entered into on November 21, 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $0.8 million, or 52.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased to 3.9% for 2014 compared to 78.7% for 2013 due primarily to the valuation allowance we established at year end in 2013.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests remained essentially unchanged in 2014, as compared to 2013.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2014 increased as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the $28.7 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $12.6 million increase in revenues and the $0.8 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $20.3 million in 2014, a decrease of 14.7% from $23.8 million recorded in 2013. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 17.0% in 2014, down from 22.3% of revenue in 2013. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was due primarily to the $15.6 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders and the $0.8 million decrease in income tax expenses. The changes were offset by a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-controlling interests and interest and other expense (income), net. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2015 consisted of $14.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $31.5 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, $3.6 million of which is reserved for our outstanding Letter of Credit Authorization agreements.\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for\nliquidity over the near term. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $103.1 million, of which $57.8 million was reimbursed through revenue for DAS build-out projects from our telecom operators.\nOn November 21, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank (the \"Lenders\"), for a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit in the initial amount of up to $46.5 million, with an option to increase the available amount to $86.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the \"Revolving Line of Credit\") and a term loan of $3.5 million (the \"Term Loan\" and together with the Revolving Line of Credit, the \"Credit Facility\"). Both the Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit mature on November 21, 2018. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan will bear, at our election, a variable interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% - 3.5% or Lender's Prime Rate plus 1.5% - 2.5% per year and we will pay a fee of 0.375% - 0.5% per year on any unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2015, $2.6 million was outstanding under the Term Loan at a rate of 3.3% and $15.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit. The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of interest and principal, amortizing fully over the four-year-term such that it is repaid in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest rates for our Credit Facility ranged from 2.67% to 3.33%. Repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representation, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, and under other specific default events including, but not limited to, non-payment or inability to pay debt, breach of cross default provisions, insolvency provisions, and change in control.\nWe are subject to customary covenants, including a minimum quarterly consolidated leverage ratio, a maximum quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and monthly liquidity minimums. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and through the date of this report. We are subject to certain non-financial covenants, and we were also in compliance with all such non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and through the date of this report. The Credit Facility provides us with significant additional flexibility and liquidity to pursue our strategic objectives for capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOn September 11, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf Registration\") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015, which permits us to offer up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In February 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to terminate the Shelf Registration and remove from registration the securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration. The Company's Board of Directors determined that having the Shelf Registration on file was no longer necessary due to the Company increasing the Revolving Line of Credit (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 hereto).\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, working capital, cash flow from operations and availability under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments, general economic trends, or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will range from $35.0 million to $40.0 million, excluding capital expenditures for DAS build-out projects, which are reimbursed through revenue from our telecom operator customers. The majority of our 2016\ncapital expenditures will be used to build out residential broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on military bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government and upgrading our Wi-Fi networks at our managed and operated venues. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We may also enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>98,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>21,207 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,671 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101,502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,199 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,403 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,068 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIn 2015, we generated $98.6 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $77.4 million from 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and a $0.7 million change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. The increases were partially offset by the $3.4 million increase in our net loss and the $0.7 million decrease in impairment losses.\nIn 2014, we generated $21.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $0.5 million from 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to a $1.9 million decrease in 2013, a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2014, and a $1.0 million impairment loss in 2014. The increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in our net loss including non-controlling interests from the prior year, a $9.0 million larger increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2014 compared to a $1.6 million decrease in 2013, a $2.0 million larger decrease in accounts payable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.1 million decrease in the change in deferred tax assets, and a $0.4 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nIn 2013, we generated $20.7 million of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of $3.9 million from 2012. The decrease was primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in our net income including non-controlling interests from the prior year and a $1.9 million decrease in excess windfall tax benefits from stock option exercises. The decreases were partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2013, a $1.6 million decrease in prepaids and other assets in 2013 compared to a $0.3 million increase in prepaids and other assets in 2012, a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2013, and a $1.2 million smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2013 compared to 2012.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2015, we used $101.5 million in investing activities, an increase of $62.3 million from 2014. This increase is primarily due to a $32.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $29.7 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2014, we used $39.2 million in investing activities, a decrease of $1.2 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2014 compared to 2013, a $19.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013, and a $0.5 million decrease in restricted cash. The decreases were partially offset by a $41.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2014 compared to 2013.\nIn 2013, we used $40.4 million in investing activities, a decrease of $22.1 million from 2012. The decrease was primarily due to $8.6 million of cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2013 compared to $41.6 million of cash used in net purchases of marketable securities in 2012. The decrease was offset by an $11.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2013 compared to 2012 and $19.5 million in net cash payments made for our acquisitions of Endeka and AWG in 2013 compared to the $3.2 million of cash payments made for our acquisition of Cloud 9 in 2012.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2015, we received $8.8 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to $0.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2014. This change is primarily due to the $11.5 million increase in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition related payments, a $0.6 million decrease in deferred financing costs, and a $0.2 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. These changes were partially offset by $1.6 million of holdback consideration payments made to the previous AWG shareholders, $1.1 million in payments to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC from the non-controlling interest owners, a $0.6 million increase in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period, and $0.9 million in repayments made on our Term Loan during 2015.\nIn 2014, we used $0.5 million in financing activities, a decrease of $10.6 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $10.9 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market in 2013 that did not recur in 2014, $2.8 million of proceeds received from our Credit Facility, net of deferred financing costs that were paid, and a $0.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in cash used to pay minimum statutory taxes related to our time-based RSUs that vested during 2014, $1.3 million of cash used to pay continent liabilities and other acquisition related consideration during 2014, and a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable.\nIn 2013, we used $11.1 million in financing activities compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 million in 2012. The change was primarily due to $6.1 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka in 2013, the $4.8 million of cash used to repurchase and retire approximately 722,000 shares of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program at an average price per share of $6.68 in 2013, and a $2.0 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2013 compared to 2012.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due By Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>2 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>4 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Venue revenue share minimums(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>43,148 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,297 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,921 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,108 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,822 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases for office space(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,955 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open purchase commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases for equipment and software(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>109,737 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,684 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,042 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,777 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Payments under exclusive long-term, non-cancellable contracts to provide wireless communications network access to venues such as airports.

In addition, our Board of Directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director.\nInflation\nInflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation may affect our future performance since we may not be able to recover the increases in our costs with similar increases in our prices.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe believe we are the leading global provider of commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services for carriers. Our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global Wi-Fi networks that cover more than 1.5 million hotspots. We manage and operate an indoor DAS network, which contains 10,900 nodes. Our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners.\nWe grew revenue from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%. We grew revenue from $106.7 million in 2013 to $119.3 million in 2014, an increase of 11.8%. We generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $22.3 million in 2015 compared to $19.5 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA increased from $20.3 million in 2014 to $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0%. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nThe proliferation of smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, the internet of things (\"IoT\") and other Wi-Fi enabled devices-in conjunction with the increased consumption of high-bandwidth activities like streaming media, cloud-based applications, and online gaming and mobile apps-has created a demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet access in public places both large and small. These data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile Internet data traffic that is expected to increase nearly eightfold between 2015 and 2020, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index. We believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill, measuring recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from several sources including: (i) retail and military customers under subscription plans for month-to-month network access that automatically renew, and retail and military single-use access from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access plans, (ii) DAS customers that are telecom operators under long-term contracts for access to our DAS at our managed and operated locations, (iii) arrangements with wholesale Wi-Fi customers that provide software licensing, network access, and/or professional services fees, and (iv) display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign-in pages. Software licensed by our wholesale Wi-Fi platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is presented net of any sales and value added taxes.\nSubscription fees from retail and military customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance. We provide refunds for our retail and military services on a case-by-case basis. These amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra-revenue in the period the refunds are made. Subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue generated from retail and military single-use access is recognized when access is provided.\nRevenue generated from access to our DAS networks consists of build-out fees and recurring access fees under certain long-term contracts with telecom operators. Build-out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period, once the build-out is complete. Periodically, we install and sell Wi-Fi and DAS networks to customers where we do not have service contracts or remaining obligations beyond the installation of those networks and we recognize build-out fees for such projects as revenue when the installation work is completed and the network has been accepted by the customer. Minimum monthly access fees for usage of the DAS networks are non-cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis. These minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the telecom operator agreement. The initial term of our contracts with telecom operators generally range from five to twenty years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue from DAS network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned.\nServices provided to wholesale Wi-Fi partners generally contain several elements including: (i) a term license to use our software to access our Wi-Fi network, (ii) access fees for Wi-Fi network usage, and/or (iii) professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the Wi-Fi service. The term license, monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates. Once the term license for integration and customization are delivered, the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement. The initial term of the license agreements is generally between one to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue for Wi-Fi network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned. All elements within existing service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement.\nIn instances where the minimum monthly Wi-Fi and DAS network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement, an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected.\nWe adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (\"ASU 2009-13\"), on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements, as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under ASC 605-25, we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. We recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is generated from advertisements on our managed and operated or partner networks. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer-specific agreement. Obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of units or the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. Advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on management's estimates of revenue and operating expenses, (ii) long- term growth rates, (iii) an appropriate discount rate and (iv) an appropriate royalty rate, where applicable. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the market, with adjustments relating to any differences between the assets. The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at prices at the time of the acquisition reduced for depreciation of the asset.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We perform our impairment test annually as of December 31st. Entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If, after assessing qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we tested our goodwill for impairment using a market based approach and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. To date, we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nWe perform an impairment review of long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and/or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value. We would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), which are granted to employees and non-employees. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis, net of estimated and actual forfeitures, over the employee requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met. The grant date fair value of our stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rates are primarily affected by changes in our valuation allowances, the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits, the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. In 2014, we updated our presentation of revenue sources to differentiate our individual users based on the nature of the users-retail users who purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations or military users who purchase Internet access or IPTV services for individual use on military bases. Accordingly, we have disaggregated our subscribers between our retail and military users. We have also removed monthly churn, which was defined as the number of subscribers who canceled their subscriptions in a given month, expressed as a percentage of the average subscribers in that month, as a key performance indicator as we no longer view monthly churn as a key business metric. Our key performance indicators follow:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>308 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-military\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connects\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DAS nodes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscribers-retail and subscribers-military. This metric represents the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end.\nConnects. This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include retail and wholesale customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network.\nDAS nodes. This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of retail revenue, military revenue, DAS revenue, wholesale revenue, and advertising and other revenue. In 2014, we updated our presentation of revenue sources to provide increased visibility into the revenue streams that are the focus of our current and future operational and development efforts. Our retail revenue sources were previously differentiated based on our retail\nplan types-subscription or single-use. We believe that it is more relevant to differentiate our individual users based on the nature of the users-retail users who purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations or military users who purchase Internet access and/or IPTV services for individual use on military bases. We also previously combined our wholesale DAS and Wi-Fi revenues and we believe that it is better to disaggregate these wholesale product revenues going forward by DAS and Wi-Fi given the current development of these products.\nRetail and military. We generate revenue from sales to retail and military individuals of month-to-month network access subscriptions that automatically renew, primarily through charge card transactions. We also generate revenue from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access to retail and military individuals primarily through charge card transactions.\nDAS. We generate revenue from telecom operator partners that pay us network build-out fees, inclusive of network upgrades, and access fees for our DAS networks.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. We generate revenue from wholesale Wi-Fi partners that license our software and pay usage-based monthly network access fees to allow their customers to access our global Wi-Fi network. Usage-based network access fees may be measured in minutes, connects, megabytes or gigabytes, and in most cases are subject to minimum volume commitments. Other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us monthly fees to provide a Wi-Fi infrastructure that we install, manage and operate at their venues for their customers under a service provider arrangement.\nAdvertising and other. We generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors to our landing pages at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs and at locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, we receive revenue from partners in certain venues where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 17% and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, two groups of entities affiliated with Verizon Communications, Inc. and AT&T Inc. each accounted for 14% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe classify our costs and operating expenses as network access, network operations, development and technology, selling and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Network access costs consist primarily of payments to venues and network partners in our network. Other costs and operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for contracted labor and development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. Facilities costs are generally allocated based on headcount. Depreciation and amortization expenses associated with specifically identifiable property and equipment are allocated to the appropriate expense categories.\nNetwork access. Network access costs consist of revenue share payments to venue owners where our managed and operated hotspots are located, usage-based fees to our roaming network partners for access to their networks, depreciation of equipment related to network build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, sale of equipment, and bandwidth and other Internet connectivity expenses in our managed and operated locations.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses consist of costs for our customer service department and for our operations staff that designs, builds, monitors and maintains the network. Also\nincluded are expenses for our customer service provider that handles customer care inquiries and expenses for network operations contractors, equipment depreciation and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses consist of costs for our product development and engineering departments, developers and our information systems services staff, depreciation of our equipment and internal-use software, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs for our business development and marketing employees and executives, travel and entertainment and marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of costs for our executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, as well as legal, accounting, tax and other professional service fees. Also included are other corporate expenses such as charge card processing fees and bad debt expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of acquired venue contracts, technology and non-compete agreements.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, primarily consist of interest income and expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2013, we established a full valuation allowance as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized and we have continued to maintain the full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In 2013, income tax expense included $2.4 million of tax expense related to increases in our valuation allowance. $1.9 million of the increase relates to additional valuation allowances that were established as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are comprised of minority holdings by third parties in our subsidiaries Chicago Concourse Development Group, LLC (\"CCDG\") and Boingo Holding Participacoes Ltda. (\"BHPL\").\nWe are generally required to pay a portion of allocated net profits less capital expenditures of the preceding year to the non-controlling interest holders of CCDG. The limited liability company agreement for CCDG does not have a term. CCDG can be dissolved upon the unanimous agreement of the members, upon the sale of CCDG, upon declaration of bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the license agreement between CCDG and the City of Chicago.\nWe attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in BHPL under the terms of the limited liability company agreement in proportion to their holdings. The limited liability company agreement with BHPL does not have a term. We, by resolution of the members, may distribute profits against retained earnings or profit reserves existing on the most recent annual balance sheet or may draw up financial statements and distribute profits in shorter periods. BHPL can be dissolved by resolution of the members and as otherwise provided for by law.\nPrior to August 4, 2015, we also had a 70% ownership of Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC (\"CCG Detroit\"). On August 4, 2015, we purchased the remaining 30% ownership interest from the non-controlling interest owners for $1.2 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of the remaining interest of an entity that had already been majority-owned by the Company. The purchase resulted in a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $1.2 million representing excess purchase price over the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests. In prior years, we attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in CCG Detroit under the terms of the limited liability company agreement. CCG Detroit had generated losses, which had reduced the non-controlling owners capital account to zero in 2009, resulting in an allocation to the controlling interest holder of all operating losses and deficits created by fixed distributions to the non-controlling interest holder. The fixed distributions were terminated during September 2013 concurrent with the termination of CCG Detroit's agreement with Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nResults of Operations\nThe

in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from our increased fixed assets for our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development in those periods.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million, or 31.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods as\nwell as $1.0 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 resulting from a change in the expected service period for one of our executives, who was terminated. Under the terms of the executive's employment agreement, the executive received 12 months of accelerated vesting credit on unvested stock-based awards. Stock-based compensation expense increased $2.7 million, or 59.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods. We have shifted our stock-based compensation from stock options to RSUs, which generally vest over a specified service period. We also issue performance-based RSUs to executive personnel. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

DAS revenue increased $8.2 million, or 21.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $6.1 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, which includes a $1.0 million short-term build-out project that included the sale of equipment that was completed during 2015, and a $2.1 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. The increase in access fees resulted primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed and $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 21.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers in 2015 compared to 2014. The remaining decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $6.7 million, or 44.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in Wi-Fi build-out revenues related to a project that was completed in 2014.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $15.4 million, or 343.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in subscribers resulting from our build-out of Wi-Fi networks at military bases.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in revenues from other service agreements.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>161,257 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137,323 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense and a $3.6 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs, which is inclusive of a $0.6 million increase in costs directly related to our short-term DAS and Wi-Fi build-out projects. The increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which included a one-time $1.9 million cost incurred in 2014 to terminate one of our venue contracts, and a $0.3 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.9 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in network maintenance and connectivity expenses, a $0.4 million increase in call center costs, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in other operating expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $4.3 million, or 28.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.6 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in hardware and software maintenance and other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.3 million, or 20.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.2 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.4 million one-time charge for salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for one of our executives who was terminated, and a $0.7 million increase in other marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million, or 28.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount, a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in business licenses, taxes, and insurance, a $0.5 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $1.4 million increase in rent and other general and administrative expenses.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014. In 2015, we incurred and capitalized $0.6 million of interest expense related to our Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2015, as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate decreased to 2.2% for 2015, as compared to 3.9% in 2014.\nOur future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as our level of future taxable income, tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre-tax income. We do not expect to incur any significant income taxes until such time that we reverse our valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets upon return to sustained profitability.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased $0.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of decreased net income for a subsidiary resulting from the transition of the managed and operated venues of this subsidiary from an end-user paid to a tiered pricing model.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the $23.9 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $20.3 million increase in revenues, the $0.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0% from $20.3 million recorded in 2014. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 21.2% in 2015, up from 17.0% of revenue in 2014. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by the $2.8 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders, the $0.6 million decrease in non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-controlling interests and interest and other expense (income), net. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nYears ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>40,336 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>43,194 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(2,858 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DAS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesale-Wi-Fi\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,052 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>119,297 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>106,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Key business metrics:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-military\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connects\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DAS nodes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Calculation of percentage change is not meaningful.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $2.9 million, or 6.6%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers. Our average revenue per retail subscriber remained essentially the same in 2014 as compared to 2013. The remaining decrease was attributable to a $0.6 million decrease in retail single-use revenue resulting from the transition of certain paid managed and operated locations to a tiered or free pricing model. Retail revenue for 2014 and 2013 includes $2.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of retail single-use revenue related to venues acquired from AWG in October 2013.\nDAS. DAS revenue increased $5.6 million, or 17.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $3.3 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations and a $2.3 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators resulting primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue decreased $2.1 million, or 11.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $3.5 million decrease in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in wholesale service provider revenues resulting from increased deployments and $0.7 million in revenue from a Wi-Fi build-out project that was completed in 2014.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $3.2 million, or 256.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013 due to deployments of our Wi-Fi and IPTV networks at military bases during 2014.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue increased $8.7 million, or 70.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $9.3 million increase in the volume of advertising sales at our managed and operated locations. The increase was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in other revenues. Advertising revenue for 2014 and 2013 includes $8.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of advertising sales at the venues acquired from AWG in October 2013.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>47,245 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137,323 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>108,640 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $12.2 million, or 25.8%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. The increase is primarily attributed to a $9.2 million increase in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which includes a one-time $1.9 million cost to terminate one of our venue contracts, a $5.4 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $3.2 million increase in internet connectivity expenses. The increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues and a $2.5 million decrease in other direct costs. Other direct costs for 2014 include $0.4 million of costs related to a Wi-Fi build out project.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $7.1 million, or 38.4%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.6 million increase in depreciation expense, a $0.6 million increase in network maintenance expenses, a $0.3 million increase in travel and entertainment expenses, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, a $0.3 million increase in call center expenses, and a $0.1 million increase in rent and other expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $3.4 million, or 30.2%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $0.7 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, a $0.4 million impairment loss related to a change in the use of certain software developed for internal use, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.5 million increase in other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $2.1 million, or 15.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount and higher sales commissions related to our increased advertising sales. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 15.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $1.8 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $1.0 million increase in stock- based compensation expenses, a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in rent and facilities expenses. General and administrative expenses includes a $0.5 million impairment loss related to a venue termination agreement that resulted in the abandonment of our Wi-Fi network assets and the release of the corresponding capital lease obligations associated with those assets. General and administrative expenses also includes a $0.8 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisition of Endeka Group, Inc. (\"Endeka\") in February 2013.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $1.5 million, or 65.2%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due primarily to our acquisitions of Endeka and AWG in February 2013 and October 2013, respectively. For future years, amortization expense is expected to be $3.5 million for 2015, $3.5 million for 2016, $3.2 million for 2017, $2.4 million for 2018, $1.6 million for 2019 and $5.5 million thereafter.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, decreased $0.1 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to our lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2014 as compared to 2013 and interest expense related to our new Credit Agreement, which we entered into on November 21, 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $0.8 million, or 52.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased to 3.9% for 2014 compared to 78.7% for 2013 due primarily to the valuation allowance we established at year end in 2013.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests remained essentially unchanged in 2014, as compared to 2013.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2014 increased as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the $28.7 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $12.6 million increase in revenues and the $0.8 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $20.3 million in 2014, a decrease of 14.7% from $23.8 million recorded in 2013. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 17.0% in 2014, down from 22.3% of revenue in 2013. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was due primarily to the $15.6 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders and the $0.8 million decrease in income tax expenses. The changes were offset by a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-controlling interests and interest and other expense (income), net. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2015 consisted of $14.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $31.5 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, $3.6 million of which is reserved for our outstanding Letter of Credit Authorization agreements.\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for\nliquidity over the near term. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $103.1 million, of which $57.8 million was reimbursed through revenue for DAS build-out projects from our telecom operators.\nOn November 21, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank (the \"Lenders\"), for a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit in the initial amount of up to $46.5 million, with an option to increase the available amount to $86.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the \"Revolving Line of Credit\") and a term loan of $3.5 million (the \"Term Loan\" and together with the Revolving Line of Credit, the \"Credit Facility\"). Both the Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit mature on November 21, 2018. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan will bear, at our election, a variable interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% - 3.5% or Lender's Prime Rate plus 1.5% - 2.5% per year and we will pay a fee of 0.375% - 0.5% per year on any unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2015, $2.6 million was outstanding under the Term Loan at a rate of 3.3% and $15.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit. The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of interest and principal, amortizing fully over the four-year-term such that it is repaid in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest rates for our Credit Facility ranged from 2.67% to 3.33%. Repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representation, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, and under other specific default events including, but not limited to, non-payment or inability to pay debt, breach of cross default provisions, insolvency provisions, and change in control.\nWe are subject to customary covenants, including a minimum quarterly consolidated leverage ratio, a maximum quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and monthly liquidity minimums. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and through the date of this report. We are subject to certain non-financial covenants, and we were also in compliance with all such non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and through the date of this report. The Credit Facility provides us with significant additional flexibility and liquidity to pursue our strategic objectives for capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOn September 11, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf Registration\") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015, which permits us to offer up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In February 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to terminate the Shelf Registration and remove from registration the securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration. The Company's Board of Directors determined that having the Shelf Registration on file was no longer necessary due to the Company increasing the Revolving Line of Credit (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 hereto).\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, working capital, cash flow from operations and availability under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments, general economic trends, or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will range from $35.0 million to $40.0 million, excluding capital expenditures for DAS build-out projects, which are reimbursed through revenue from our telecom operator customers. The majority of our 2016\ncapital expenditures will be used to build out residential broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on military bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government and upgrading our Wi-Fi networks at our managed and operated venues. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We may also enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>98,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>21,207 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,671 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101,502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,199 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,403 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,068 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIn 2015, we generated $98.6 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $77.4 million from 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and a $0.7 million change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. The increases were partially offset by the $3.4 million increase in our net loss and the $0.7 million decrease in impairment losses.\nIn 2014, we generated $21.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $0.5 million from 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to a $1.9 million decrease in 2013, a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2014, and a $1.0 million impairment loss in 2014. The increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in our net loss including non-controlling interests from the prior year, a $9.0 million larger increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2014 compared to a $1.6 million decrease in 2013, a $2.0 million larger decrease in accounts payable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.1 million decrease in the change in deferred tax assets, and a $0.4 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nIn 2013, we generated $20.7 million of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of $3.9 million from 2012. The decrease was primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in our net income including non-controlling interests from the prior year and a $1.9 million decrease in excess windfall tax benefits from stock option exercises. The decreases were partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2013, a $1.6 million decrease in prepaids and other assets in 2013 compared to a $0.3 million increase in prepaids and other assets in 2012, a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2013, and a $1.2 million smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2013 compared to 2012.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2015, we used $101.5 million in investing activities, an increase of $62.3 million from 2014. This increase is primarily due to a $32.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $29.7 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2014, we used $39.2 million in investing activities, a decrease of $1.2 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2014 compared to 2013, a $19.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013, and a $0.5 million decrease in restricted cash. The decreases were partially offset by a $41.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2014 compared to 2013.\nIn 2013, we used $40.4 million in investing activities, a decrease of $22.1 million from 2012. The decrease was primarily due to $8.6 million of cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2013 compared to $41.6 million of cash used in net purchases of marketable securities in 2012. The decrease was offset by an $11.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2013 compared to 2012 and $19.5 million in net cash payments made for our acquisitions of Endeka and AWG in 2013 compared to the $3.2 million of cash payments made for our acquisition of Cloud 9 in 2012.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2015, we received $8.8 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to $0.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2014. This change is primarily due to the $11.5 million increase in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition related payments, a $0.6 million decrease in deferred financing costs, and a $0.2 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. These changes were partially offset by $1.6 million of holdback consideration payments made to the previous AWG shareholders, $1.1 million in payments to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC from the non-controlling interest owners, a $0.6 million increase in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period, and $0.9 million in repayments made on our Term Loan during 2015.\nIn 2014, we used $0.5 million in financing activities, a decrease of $10.6 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $10.9 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market in 2013 that did not recur in 2014, $2.8 million of proceeds received from our Credit Facility, net of deferred financing costs that were paid, and a $0.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in cash used to pay minimum statutory taxes related to our time-based RSUs that vested during 2014, $1.3 million of cash used to pay continent liabilities and other acquisition related consideration during 2014, and a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable.\nIn 2013, we used $11.1 million in financing activities compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 million in 2012. The change was primarily due to $6.1 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka in 2013, the $4.8 million of cash used to repurchase and retire approximately 722,000 shares of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program at an average price per share of $6.68 in 2013, and a $2.0 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2013 compared to 2012.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due By Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>2 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>4 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Venue revenue share minimums(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>43,148 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,297 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,921 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,108 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,822 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases for office space(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,955 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open purchase commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases for equipment and software(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>109,737 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,684 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,042 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,777 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Payments under exclusive long-term, non-cancellable contracts to provide wireless communications network access to venues such as airports.

In addition, our Board of Directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director.\nInflation\nInflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation may affect our future performance since we may not be able to recover the increases in our costs with similar increases in our prices.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe believe we are the leading global provider of commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services for carriers. Our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global Wi-Fi networks that cover more than 1.5 million hotspots. We manage and operate an indoor DAS network, which contains 10,900 nodes. Our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners.\nWe grew revenue from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%. We grew revenue from $106.7 million in 2013 to $119.3 million in 2014, an increase of 11.8%. We generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $22.3 million in 2015 compared to $19.5 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA increased from $20.3 million in 2014 to $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0%. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nThe proliferation of smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, the internet of things (\"IoT\") and other Wi-Fi enabled devices-in conjunction with the increased consumption of high-bandwidth activities like streaming media, cloud-based applications, and online gaming and mobile apps-has created a demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet access in public places both large and small. These data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile Internet data traffic that is expected to increase nearly eightfold between 2015 and 2020, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index. We believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill, measuring recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from several sources including: (i) retail and military customers under subscription plans for month-to-month network access that automatically renew, and retail and military single-use access from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access plans, (ii) DAS customers that are telecom operators under long-term contracts for access to our DAS at our managed and operated locations, (iii) arrangements with wholesale Wi-Fi customers that provide software licensing, network access, and/or professional services fees, and (iv) display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign-in pages. Software licensed by our wholesale Wi-Fi platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is presented net of any sales and value added taxes.\nSubscription fees from retail and military customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance. We provide refunds for our retail and military services on a case-by-case basis. These amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra-revenue in the period the refunds are made. Subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue generated from retail and military single-use access is recognized when access is provided.\nRevenue generated from access to our DAS networks consists of build-out fees and recurring access fees under certain long-term contracts with telecom operators. Build-out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period, once the build-out is complete. Periodically, we install and sell Wi-Fi and DAS networks to customers where we do not have service contracts or remaining obligations beyond the installation of those networks and we recognize build-out fees for such projects as revenue when the installation work is completed and the network has been accepted by the customer. Minimum monthly access fees for usage of the DAS networks are non-cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis. These minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the telecom operator agreement. The initial term of our contracts with telecom operators generally range from five to twenty years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue from DAS network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned.\nServices provided to wholesale Wi-Fi partners generally contain several elements including: (i) a term license to use our software to access our Wi-Fi network, (ii) access fees for Wi-Fi network usage, and/or (iii) professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the Wi-Fi service. The term license, monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates. Once the term license for integration and customization are delivered, the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement. The initial term of the license agreements is generally between one to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue for Wi-Fi network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned. All elements within existing service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement.\nIn instances where the minimum monthly Wi-Fi and DAS network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement, an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected.\nWe adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (\"ASU 2009-13\"), on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements, as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under ASC 605-25, we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. We recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is generated from advertisements on our managed and operated or partner networks. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer-specific agreement. Obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of units or the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. Advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on management's estimates of revenue and operating expenses, (ii) long- term growth rates, (iii) an appropriate discount rate and (iv) an appropriate royalty rate, where applicable. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the market, with adjustments relating to any differences between the assets. The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at prices at the time of the acquisition reduced for depreciation of the asset.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We perform our impairment test annually as of December 31st. Entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If, after assessing qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we tested our goodwill for impairment using a market based approach and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. To date, we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nWe perform an impairment review of long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and/or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value. We would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), which are granted to employees and non-employees. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis, net of estimated and actual forfeitures, over the employee requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met. The grant date fair value of our stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rates are primarily affected by changes in our valuation allowances, the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits, the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. In 2014, we updated our presentation of revenue sources to differentiate our individual users based on the nature of the users-retail users who purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations or military users who purchase Internet access or IPTV services for individual use on military bases. Accordingly, we have disaggregated our subscribers between our retail and military users. We have also removed monthly churn, which was defined as the number of subscribers who canceled their subscriptions in a given month, expressed as a percentage of the average subscribers in that month, as a key performance indicator as we no longer view monthly churn as a key business metric. Our key performance indicators follow:\n\nSubscribers-retail and subscribers-military. This metric represents the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end.\nConnects. This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include retail and wholesale customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network.\nDAS nodes. This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of retail revenue, military revenue, DAS revenue, wholesale revenue, and advertising and other revenue. In 2014, we updated our presentation of revenue sources to provide increased visibility into the revenue streams that are the focus of our current and future operational and development efforts. Our retail revenue sources were previously differentiated based on our retail\nplan types-subscription or single-use. We believe that it is more relevant to differentiate our individual users based on the nature of the users-retail users who purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations or military users who purchase Internet access and/or IPTV services for individual use on military bases. We also previously combined our wholesale DAS and Wi-Fi revenues and we believe that it is better to disaggregate these wholesale product revenues going forward by DAS and Wi-Fi given the current development of these products.\nRetail and military. We generate revenue from sales to retail and military individuals of month-to-month network access subscriptions that automatically renew, primarily through charge card transactions. We also generate revenue from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access to retail and military individuals primarily through charge card transactions.\nDAS. We generate revenue from telecom operator partners that pay us network build-out fees, inclusive of network upgrades, and access fees for our DAS networks.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. We generate revenue from wholesale Wi-Fi partners that license our software and pay usage-based monthly network access fees to allow their customers to access our global Wi-Fi network. Usage-based network access fees may be measured in minutes, connects, megabytes or gigabytes, and in most cases are subject to minimum volume commitments. Other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us monthly fees to provide a Wi-Fi infrastructure that we install, manage and operate at their venues for their customers under a service provider arrangement.\nAdvertising and other. We generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors to our landing pages at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs and at locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, we receive revenue from partners in certain venues where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 17% and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, two groups of entities affiliated with Verizon Communications, Inc. and AT&T Inc. each accounted for 14% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe classify our costs and operating expenses as network access, network operations, development and technology, selling and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Network access costs consist primarily of payments to venues and network partners in our network. Other costs and operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for contracted labor and development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. Facilities costs are generally allocated based on headcount. Depreciation and amortization expenses associated with specifically identifiable property and equipment are allocated to the appropriate expense categories.\nNetwork access. Network access costs consist of revenue share payments to venue owners where our managed and operated hotspots are located, usage-based fees to our roaming network partners for access to their networks, depreciation of equipment related to network build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, sale of equipment, and bandwidth and other Internet connectivity expenses in our managed and operated locations.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses consist of costs for our customer service department and for our operations staff that designs, builds, monitors and maintains the network. Also\nincluded are expenses for our customer service provider that handles customer care inquiries and expenses for network operations contractors, equipment depreciation and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses consist of costs for our product development and engineering departments, developers and our information systems services staff, depreciation of our equipment and internal-use software, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs for our business development and marketing employees and executives, travel and entertainment and marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of costs for our executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, as well as legal, accounting, tax and other professional service fees. Also included are other corporate expenses such as charge card processing fees and bad debt expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of acquired venue contracts, technology and non-compete agreements.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, primarily consist of interest income and expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2013, we established a full valuation allowance as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized and we have continued to maintain the full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In 2013, income tax expense included $2.4 million of tax expense related to increases in our valuation allowance. $1.9 million of the increase relates to additional valuation allowances that were established as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are comprised of minority holdings by third parties in our subsidiaries Chicago Concourse Development Group, LLC (\"CCDG\") and Boingo Holding Participacoes Ltda. (\"BHPL\").\nWe are generally required to pay a portion of allocated net profits less capital expenditures of the preceding year to the non-controlling interest holders of CCDG. The limited liability company agreement for CCDG does not have a term. CCDG can be dissolved upon the unanimous agreement of the members, upon the sale of CCDG, upon declaration of bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the license agreement between CCDG and the City of Chicago.\nWe attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in BHPL under the terms of the limited liability company agreement in proportion to their holdings. The limited liability company agreement with BHPL does not have a term. We, by resolution of the members, may distribute profits against retained earnings or profit reserves existing on the most recent annual balance sheet or may draw up financial statements and distribute profits in shorter periods. BHPL can be dissolved by resolution of the members and as otherwise provided for by law.\nPrior to August 4, 2015, we also had a 70% ownership of Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC (\"CCG Detroit\"). On August 4, 2015, we purchased the remaining 30% ownership interest from the non-controlling interest owners for $1.2 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of the remaining interest of an entity that had already been majority-owned by the Company. The purchase resulted in a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $1.2 million representing excess purchase price over the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests. In prior years, we attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in CCG Detroit under the terms of the limited liability company agreement. CCG Detroit had generated losses, which had reduced the non-controlling owners capital account to zero in 2009, resulting in an allocation to the controlling interest holder of all operating losses and deficits created by fixed distributions to the non-controlling interest holder. The fixed distributions were terminated during September 2013 concurrent with the termination of CCG Detroit's agreement with Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the specified periods.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense increased $10.8 million, or 39.5%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, and depreciation expense increased $8.5 million, or 44.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from our increased fixed assets for our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development in those periods.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million, or 31.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods as\nwell as $1.0 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 resulting from a change in the expected service period for one of our executives, who was terminated. Under the terms of the executive's employment agreement, the executive received 12 months of accelerated vesting credit on unvested stock-based awards. Stock-based compensation expense increased $2.7 million, or 59.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods. We have shifted our stock-based compensation from stock options to RSUs, which generally vest over a specified service period. We also issue performance-based RSUs to executive personnel. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.\n\nYears ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\nDAS. DAS revenue increased $8.2 million, or 21.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $6.1 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, which includes a $1.0 million short-term build-out project that included the sale of equipment that was completed during 2015, and a $2.1 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. The increase in access fees resulted primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed and $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 21.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers in 2015 compared to 2014. The remaining decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $6.7 million, or 44.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in Wi-Fi build-out revenues related to a project that was completed in 2014.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $15.4 million, or 343.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in subscribers resulting from our build-out of Wi-Fi networks at military bases.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in revenues from other service agreements.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\n\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense and a $3.6 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs, which is inclusive of a $0.6 million increase in costs directly related to our short-term DAS and Wi-Fi build-out projects. The increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which included a one-time $1.9 million cost incurred in 2014 to terminate one of our venue contracts, and a $0.3 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.9 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in network maintenance and connectivity expenses, a $0.4 million increase in call center costs, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in other operating expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $4.3 million, or 28.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.6 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in hardware and software maintenance and other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.3 million, or 20.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.2 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.4 million one-time charge for salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for one of our executives who was terminated, and a $0.7 million increase in other marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million, or 28.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount, a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in business licenses, taxes, and insurance, a $0.5 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $1.4 million increase in rent and other general and administrative expenses.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014. In 2015, we incurred and capitalized $0.6 million of interest expense related to our Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2015, as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate decreased to 2.2% for 2015, as compared to 3.9% in 2014.\nOur future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as our level of future taxable income, tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre-tax income. We do not expect to incur any significant income taxes until such time that we reverse our valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets upon return to sustained profitability.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased $0.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of decreased net income for a subsidiary resulting from the transition of the managed and operated venues of this subsidiary from an end-user paid to a tiered pricing model.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the $23.9 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $20.3 million increase in revenues, the $0.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0% from $20.3 million recorded in 2014. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 21.2% in 2015, up from 17.0% of revenue in 2014. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by the $2.8 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders, the $0.6 million decrease in non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-controlling interests and interest and other expense (income), net. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nYears ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\n\n*Calculation of percentage change is not meaningful.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $2.9 million, or 6.6%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers. Our average revenue per retail subscriber remained essentially the same in 2014 as compared to 2013. The remaining decrease was attributable to a $0.6 million decrease in retail single-use revenue resulting from the transition of certain paid managed and operated locations to a tiered or free pricing model. Retail revenue for 2014 and 2013 includes $2.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of retail single-use revenue related to venues acquired from AWG in October 2013.\nDAS. DAS revenue increased $5.6 million, or 17.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $3.3 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations and a $2.3 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators resulting primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue decreased $2.1 million, or 11.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $3.5 million decrease in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in wholesale service provider revenues resulting from increased deployments and $0.7 million in revenue from a Wi-Fi build-out project that was completed in 2014.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $3.2 million, or 256.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013 due to deployments of our Wi-Fi and IPTV networks at military bases during 2014.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue increased $8.7 million, or 70.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $9.3 million increase in the volume of advertising sales at our managed and operated locations. The increase was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in other revenues. Advertising revenue for 2014 and 2013 includes $8.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of advertising sales at the venues acquired from AWG in October 2013.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\n\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $12.2 million, or 25.8%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. The increase is primarily attributed to a $9.2 million increase in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which includes a one-time $1.9 million cost to terminate one of our venue contracts, a $5.4 million increase in depreciation expense, and a $3.2 million increase in internet connectivity expenses. The increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues and a $2.5 million decrease in other direct costs. Other direct costs for 2014 include $0.4 million of costs related to a Wi-Fi build out project.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $7.1 million, or 38.4%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.6 million increase in depreciation expense, a $0.6 million increase in network maintenance expenses, a $0.3 million increase in travel and entertainment expenses, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, a $0.3 million increase in call center expenses, and a $0.1 million increase in rent and other expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $3.4 million, or 30.2%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $0.7 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, a $0.4 million impairment loss related to a change in the use of certain software developed for internal use, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.5 million increase in other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $2.1 million, or 15.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily resulting from increased headcount and higher sales commissions related to our increased advertising sales. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 15.9%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due to a $1.8 million increase in personnel related expenses, inclusive of a $1.0 million increase in stock- based compensation expenses, a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in rent and facilities expenses. General and administrative expenses includes a $0.5 million impairment loss related to a venue termination agreement that resulted in the abandonment of our Wi-Fi network assets and the release of the corresponding capital lease obligations associated with those assets. General and administrative expenses also includes a $0.8 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisition of Endeka Group, Inc. (\"Endeka\") in February 2013.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $1.5 million, or 65.2%, in 2014, as compared to 2013, due primarily to our acquisitions of Endeka and AWG in February 2013 and October 2013, respectively. For future years, amortization expense is expected to be $3.5 million for 2015, $3.5 million for 2016, $3.2 million for 2017, $2.4 million for 2018, $1.6 million for 2019 and $5.5 million thereafter.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, decreased $0.1 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to our lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2014 as compared to 2013 and interest expense related to our new Credit Agreement, which we entered into on November 21, 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $0.8 million, or 52.1%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased to 3.9% for 2014 compared to 78.7% for 2013 due primarily to the valuation allowance we established at year end in 2013.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests remained essentially unchanged in 2014, as compared to 2013.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2014 increased as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the $28.7 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $12.6 million increase in revenues and the $0.8 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $20.3 million in 2014, a decrease of 14.7% from $23.8 million recorded in 2013. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 17.0% in 2014, down from 22.3% of revenue in 2013. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was due primarily to the $15.6 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders and the $0.8 million decrease in income tax expenses. The changes were offset by a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-controlling interests and interest and other expense (income), net. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2015 consisted of $14.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $31.5 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, $3.6 million of which is reserved for our outstanding Letter of Credit Authorization agreements.\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for\nliquidity over the near term. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $103.1 million, of which $57.8 million was reimbursed through revenue for DAS build-out projects from our telecom operators.\nOn November 21, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank (the \"Lenders\"), for a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit in the initial amount of up to $46.5 million, with an option to increase the available amount to $86.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the \"Revolving Line of Credit\") and a term loan of $3.5 million (the \"Term Loan\" and together with the Revolving Line of Credit, the \"Credit Facility\"). Both the Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit mature on November 21, 2018. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan will bear, at our election, a variable interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% - 3.5% or Lender's Prime Rate plus 1.5% - 2.5% per year and we will pay a fee of 0.375% - 0.5% per year on any unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2015, $2.6 million was outstanding under the Term Loan at a rate of 3.3% and $15.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit. The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of interest and principal, amortizing fully over the four-year-term such that it is repaid in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest rates for our Credit Facility ranged from 2.67% to 3.33%. Repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representation, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, and under other specific default events including, but not limited to, non-payment or inability to pay debt, breach of cross default provisions, insolvency provisions, and change in control.\nWe are subject to customary covenants, including a minimum quarterly consolidated leverage ratio, a maximum quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and monthly liquidity minimums. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and through the date of this report. We are subject to certain non-financial covenants, and we were also in compliance with all such non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and through the date of this report. The Credit Facility provides us with significant additional flexibility and liquidity to pursue our strategic objectives for capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOn September 11, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf Registration\") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015, which permits us to offer up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In February 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to terminate the Shelf Registration and remove from registration the securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration. The Company's Board of Directors determined that having the Shelf Registration on file was no longer necessary due to the Company increasing the Revolving Line of Credit (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 hereto).\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, working capital, cash flow from operations and availability under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments, general economic trends, or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will range from $35.0 million to $40.0 million, excluding capital expenditures for DAS build-out projects, which are reimbursed through revenue from our telecom operator customers. The majority of our 2016\ncapital expenditures will be used to build out residential broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on military bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government and upgrading our Wi-Fi networks at our managed and operated venues. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We may also enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIn 2015, we generated $98.6 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $77.4 million from 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and a $0.7 million change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. The increases were partially offset by the $3.4 million increase in our net loss and the $0.7 million decrease in impairment losses.\nIn 2014, we generated $21.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $0.5 million from 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to a $1.9 million decrease in 2013, a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2014, and a $1.0 million impairment loss in 2014. The increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in our net loss including non-controlling interests from the prior year, a $9.0 million larger increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2014 compared to a $1.6 million decrease in 2013, a $2.0 million larger decrease in accounts payable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.1 million decrease in the change in deferred tax assets, and a $0.4 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nIn 2013, we generated $20.7 million of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of $3.9 million from 2012. The decrease was primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in our net income including non-controlling interests from the prior year and a $1.9 million decrease in excess windfall tax benefits from stock option exercises. The decreases were partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2013, a $1.6 million decrease in prepaids and other assets in 2013 compared to a $0.3 million increase in prepaids and other assets in 2012, a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2013, and a $1.2 million smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2013 compared to 2012.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2015, we used $101.5 million in investing activities, an increase of $62.3 million from 2014. This increase is primarily due to a $32.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $29.7 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2014, we used $39.2 million in investing activities, a decrease of $1.2 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2014 compared to 2013, a $19.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013, and a $0.5 million decrease in restricted cash. The decreases were partially offset by a $41.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2014 compared to 2013.\nIn 2013, we used $40.4 million in investing activities, a decrease of $22.1 million from 2012. The decrease was primarily due to $8.6 million of cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2013 compared to $41.6 million of cash used in net purchases of marketable securities in 2012. The decrease was offset by an $11.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2013 compared to 2012 and $19.5 million in net cash payments made for our acquisitions of Endeka and AWG in 2013 compared to the $3.2 million of cash payments made for our acquisition of Cloud 9 in 2012.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2015, we received $8.8 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to $0.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2014. This change is primarily due to the $11.5 million increase in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition related payments, a $0.6 million decrease in deferred financing costs, and a $0.2 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. These changes were partially offset by $1.6 million of holdback consideration payments made to the previous AWG shareholders, $1.1 million in payments to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC from the non-controlling interest owners, a $0.6 million increase in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period, and $0.9 million in repayments made on our Term Loan during 2015.\nIn 2014, we used $0.5 million in financing activities, a decrease of $10.6 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $10.9 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market in 2013 that did not recur in 2014, $2.8 million of proceeds received from our Credit Facility, net of deferred financing costs that were paid, and a $0.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in cash used to pay minimum statutory taxes related to our time-based RSUs that vested during 2014, $1.3 million of cash used to pay continent liabilities and other acquisition related consideration during 2014, and a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable.\nIn 2013, we used $11.1 million in financing activities compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 million in 2012. The change was primarily due to $6.1 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka in 2013, the $4.8 million of cash used to repurchase and retire approximately 722,000 shares of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program at an average price per share of $6.68 in 2013, and a $2.0 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2013 compared to 2012.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015:\n\n(1)Payments under exclusive long-term, non-cancellable contracts to provide wireless communications network access to venues such as airports. Expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(2)Office space under non-cancellable operating leases.\n(3)Open purchase commitments are for the purchase of property and equipment, supplies and services. They are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 as we have not received the related goods or services.\n(4)Long-term debt associated with our Credit Agreement with Bank of America N.A. Payments are based on contractual terms and intended timing of repayments of long-term debt.\n(5)Leased equipment, primarily for data communication and database software, under non-cancellable capital leases.\n(6)The unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact the effective tax rate or additional paid-in capital, if recognized (refer to Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8).\n(7)Notes payable assumed in our acquisition of Endeka in 2013.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off- balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nUnder our Audit Committee charter, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions on a quarterly basis. In addition, our Board of Directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director.\nInflation\nInflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation may affect our future performance since we may not be able to recover the increases in our costs with similar increases in our prices.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14:

Revenue grew 17% from 2014 to 2015. There was a net loss in 2015 of $22.3 million compared to $19.5 million in 2014, but Adjusted EBITDA increased 46% from 2014.\n\nRevenue \n- DAS, military, and wholesale Wi-Fi revenue grew significantly from 2014 to 2015. Retail and advertising revenue declined. Overall revenue was up 17%.\n\nExpenses\n- All expense categories increased from 2014 to 2015, with the largest increases in network operations, development and technology, general and administrative, and depreciation. Total costs and expenses increased 17.4%.\n\nLiquidity/Cash Flows\n- Positive cash flow from operations in 2015 increased significantly compared to 2014 due to changes in working capital. Cash used in investing increased due to more spending on property and equipment. Cash from financing increased due to drawing on credit facility. \n\nOutlook\n- Expects continued increasing data demands to drive revenue growth opportunities. Plans 35-40 million of capital expenditures in 2016, excluding DAS investments which are reimbursed. Believes existing sources of liquidity are sufficient for at least the next 12 months.\n\nThe report provides an overview of Boingo's financial performance, changes from 2014 to 2015, outlook for 2016, and assessment of liquidity. Key points relate to strong revenue growth but increasing costs and losses, offset by positive Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flows."}
