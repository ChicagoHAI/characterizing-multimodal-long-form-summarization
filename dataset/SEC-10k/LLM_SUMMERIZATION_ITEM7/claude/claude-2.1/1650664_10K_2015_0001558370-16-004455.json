Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with genetically defined diseases by correcting their disease-causing genes. Our mission is to translate the promise of genome editing science into a broad class of transformative genomic medicines to benefit the greatest number of patients. To this end, we are developing a proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Our product development strategy is to target genetically defined diseases with an initial focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. We are advancing over a dozen discovery research programs, including programs to address genetic, infectious, and oncologic diseases of the liver, lung, blood, eye, and muscle. Our most advanced program is designed to address a specific genetic form of retinal degeneration called Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, a disease with no available therapies or potential treatments in clinical trials in either the United States or European Union. We aim to initiate a clinical trial in this program in 2017. In May 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, to develop novel engineered T cell therapies for cancer.\nSince our inception in September 2013, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, assembling our core capabilities in genome editing, seeking to identify potential product candidates, and undertaking preclinical studies. All of our research programs are still in the preclinical or research stage of development and their risk of failure is high. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the initial public offering of our common stock, or IPO, private placements of our preferred stock, and our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. From inception through December 31, 2015, we raised an aggregate of $190.3 million to fund our operations, consisting of $163.3 million of gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock, a $25.0 million up-front payment under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, and $2.0 million of gross proceeds from an equipment loan financing.\nOn February 8, 2016, we completed our IPO and sold 6,785,000 shares of our common stock, including 885,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $16.00 per share for an aggregate offering of approximately $108.6 million. We received aggregate net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $97.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $72.9 million, $13.7 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $88.3 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we continue our current research programs and our preclinical development activities; seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; further develop our genome editing platform; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We do not expect to be profitable for the year ending December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.6 million of collaboration revenue related to our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. As of December 31, 2015, we had not received any milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. For additional information about our revenue recognition policy related to the collaboration, see the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue.\u201d\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue will be generated from our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics and any other collaborations we may enter into.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies under our research programs, which include:\nTable 314: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nemployee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical activities and in manufacturing preclinical study materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nconsultant fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfacility costs including rent, depreciation, and maintenance expenses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfees for maintaining licenses under our third-party licensing agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates we may identify and develop. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 320: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and Investigational New Drug-enabling studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestablishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nlaunching commercial sales of the product, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\neffectively competing with other therapies and treatment options;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na continued acceptable safety profile following approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nenforcing and defending intellectual property and proprietary rights and claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nachieving desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any product candidates we may develop would significantly change the costs, timing, and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nOther than in connection with our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we do not track research and development costs on a program-by-program basis as we have not yet identified a product candidate for advancement into clinical trials. We plan to track research and development costs for any individual development program when we identify a product candidate from the program that we believe we can advance into clinical trials.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development programs progress, including as we continue to support the preclinical studies for our LCA10 program as well as our other research programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development, legal, and human resource functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of any product candidates we identify and develop. These increases will include increased costs associated with the lease of a new facility for our headquarters and will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, and fees to outside consultants. We also anticipate increased expenses related to reimbursement of third-party patent-related expenses and increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs for audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. With respect to reimbursement of third-party patent-related expenses specifically, given the ongoing nature of the interference and opposition proceedings involving the patents licensed to us under our license agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard (described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d), we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses related to these proceedings during future periods will increase substantially until such interference and opposition proceedings are resolved.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of re-measurement gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the tranche rights associated with our Series A-1 preferred stock, warrant liability associated with the warrant we issued to our equipment loan lender, and the anti-dilutive protection liability associated with our issuance of common stock to certain licensors. In June 2015, upon the issuance of the final tranche of our Series A preferred stock, the tranche right liability was settled and reclassified to Series A preferred stock and the anti-dilutive protection liability was settled and reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. Therefore no further re-measurement gains or losses will be recognized related to the tranche rights or the anti-dilutive protection liability. In connection with the closing of our IPO, all of our preferred stock converted into common stock on a 2.6-for-one basis.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nAs of December 31, 2015, all of our revenue to date had been generated exclusively from our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\nTable 331: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndelivery has occurred or services have been rendered;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncollectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nDetermination of Accounting Units\nWe analyze multiple element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within our control. In assessing whether an item under a collaboration has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider whether our collaboration partner can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s), and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).\nOptions under a collaboration are considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the cost to exercise the option, the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaboration partner might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, and the likelihood the option will be exercised. When an option is considered substantive, we would not consider the option or item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated option fees are not included in allocable consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, when an option is not considered substantive, we would consider the option, including other deliverables contingent upon the exercise of the option, to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in allocable arrangement consideration. In addition, if the price of the option includes a significant incremental discount, the discount would be included as a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement.\nAllocation of Arrangement Consideration\nArrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. The applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE or TPE is available. We have only used BESP to estimate selling price, since we have not had VSOE or TPE of selling price for any units of accounting to date. Determining BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the applicable agreement and estimated costs. We validate BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used by us to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nPattern of Recognition\nWe recognize the arrangement's consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize revenue associated with licenses, license options, or the discount related to a license option upon (i) delivery of the license or (ii) the earlier of exercise or expiration of the license option, if the underlying license has standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided after delivering that license. If the license does not have standalone value, the amounts allocated to the license will be combined with the related undelivered items as a single unit of accounting.\nWe recognize the amounts associated with collaboration research and development services, joint research committees, or other services ratably over the associated period of performance. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period that we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the collaboration partner can be determined and objectively measureable performance exists, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative revenue earned determined using the straight line method or proportional performance, as applicable, as of the period end date.\nRecognition of Milestones and Royalties\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonably\nrelative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestones and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestones in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. In accordance with ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, a clinical or regulatory milestone that is considered substantive will be recognized as revenue in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive would be recognized as revenue over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue from a commercial milestone payment will be accounted for as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWe will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying contract terms, provided that the reported sales are reliably measurable, we have no remaining performance obligations, and assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe record our expenses related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nFair Value Measurements\nTranche Rights\nThe Series A preferred stock purchase agreement that we entered into provided the investors with the right, upon achievement of certain milestones, to participate in subsequent offerings of Series A preferred stock, which we refer to as tranche rights. The tranche rights meet the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as the tranche rights are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series A preferred stock. Since the Series A preferred stock was redeemable at the holder's option subject to certain limitations, the tranche rights were classified as an asset or\nliability and were initially recorded at fair value and then marked to market at each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement of the tranche rights.\nWe determined fair value utilizing the concept of Fair Value\u201d from ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, or ASC 820, which states that any fair value measurement requires that the reporting entity to determine the valuation technique(s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorized.\nThe estimated fair value of the tranche rights was determined using a probability-weighted present value model that considered the probability and timing of closing a tranche, the estimated future value of the Series A preferred stock to be issued at each closing, and the amount of the investment required at each closing. Future values were converted to present value using a discount rate appropriate for probability-adjusted cash flows. Upon the settlement of each tranche, the fair value of the tranche rights associated with that tranche was reclassified to Series A preferred stock at its then fair value and thereafter was no longer re-measured.\nWarrants\nIn conjunction with an equipment loan financing, we issued to Silicon Valley Bank a warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The fair value of the warrant at the issuance date was recorded as a reduction to face value of the debt balance and was amortized as interest expense, along with other debt issuance costs, over the term of the loan. Due to the liquidation preferences of the Series A-1 preferred stock, we recorded the warrant as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Following a reverse stock split in January 2016 and the closing of our IPO in February 2016, such warrant converted into a warrant to purchase 23,076 shares of our common stock, which Silicon Valley Bank fully exercised in February 2016 pursuant to a net exercise provision for an aggregate of 19,271 shares of our common stock.\nAnti-dilutive Protection Liability\nPursuant to agreements with licensors and in consideration for licenses received, we paid certain institutions upfront payments in cash, issued shares of common stock equal to a certain percentage of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, and granted to the institutions the right to receive future issuances of common stock to maintain their respective ownership percentages of our company through the final tranche of our Series A preferred stock financing that ultimately occurred in June 2015. The anti-dilutive protection obligation under these agreements met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument and the obligation was legally detachable and separately exercisable from the original issuance of the common stock. We concluded that the anti-dilutive protection obligation represented a liability because the anti-dilutive feature represented a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares and the monetary value of the obligation was based on something other than the fair value of the equity shares. As such, we recorded the initial value of the obligation at the issuance date as research and development expense (considered additional consideration paid to the licensors) and the liability was marked to market at each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement date.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based compensation awards to employees, including grants of restricted stock and stock options, to be recognized as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of certain subjective assumptions, including (1) the expected stock price volatility, (2) the calculation of expected term of the award, (3) the risk-free interest rate, and (4) the expected dividend yield. Because there had been no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, there is a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data. Accordingly, we base our estimates of expected volatility on\nthe historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. We calculate historical volatility based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term. We compute expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a representative group of companies with similar characteristics to us, including their stages of product development and focus on the life science industry. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term.

We expect the impact of our stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options granted to employees and non-employees to grow in future periods due to the potential increases in the value of our common stock and headcount.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock on Grant Dates\nWe historically have granted stock options and restricted stock at exercise or purchase prices not less than the fair value of our common stock. Due to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the commencement of trading of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 3, 2016 in connection with our IPO, the estimated fair values of our common stock as of the grant dates prior to our IPO were determined contemporaneously by our board of directors. Since 2014, our board of directors' determinations have involved the preparation of valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid. Following our IPO, it is no longer necessary for us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for stock options or other equity awards, as the fair value of our common stock can be determined by reference to its closing price on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of the applicable grant.\nFollowing our entry into license agreements with The Broad Institute, Inc., the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, our board of directors performed common stock valuations, with the assistance of a third-party\nvaluation specialist, as of October 31, 2014, June 1, 2015, August 4, 2015, and October 23, 2015, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $0.65, $3.23, $6.48, and $11.21 per share, respectively, as of those dates. In conducting its valuations, our board of directors considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including its best estimate of our business condition, prospects, and operating performance at each valuation date. Within the valuations performed, a range of factors, assumptions, and methodologies were used. The significant factors included:\nTable 340: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe lack of an active public market for our common and our convertible preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe prices of shares of our convertible preferred stock that we had sold to outside investors in arm's length transactions, and the rights, preferences, and privileges of that convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour results of operations and financial condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe entry into license agreements, pursuant to which we obtained rights to important intellectual property;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe material risks related to our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our common stock, such as an initial public offering, given prevailing market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor financial reporting purposes, we also performed common stock valuations retrospectively, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, as of April 16, 2015, June 1, 2015, and September 14, 2015, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $4.84, $5.91, and $8.92 per share, respectively, as of those dates. Our retrospective valuations were prepared in accordance with the guidelines in the Practice Aid following the methodologies described below.\nThere are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates have included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to complete an IPO or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss, and net loss per share applicable to common stockholders could have been significantly different.\nCommon Stock Valuation Methodologies\nOur common stock valuations were prepared using the option-pricing method, or OPM, and a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, and the OPM.\nOPM\nThe OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In this model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call\noption with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the convertible preferred stock liquidation preference is paid.\nThe OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. This model defines the securities' fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event and the estimated volatility of the equity securities. The aggregate value of the common stock derived from the OPM is then divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding to arrive at the per share value.\nWe used the OPM back-solve approach to estimate enterprise value under the OPM. The OPM back-solve approach uses the OPM to derive an implied equity value for one type of a company's equity securities from a contemporaneous sale transaction involving another type of the company's equity securities. For the OPM, we based our assumed volatility factor on the historical trading volatility of our publicly traded peer companies. At each valuation date, we determined the appropriate volatility to be used, considering such factors as our expected time to a liquidity event and our stage of development.\nTo derive the fair value of our common stock using the OPM, we calculated the proceeds to our common stockholders based on the preferences and priorities of our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We then applied a discount for lack of marketability to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market.\nOur contemporaneous common stock valuations as of October 31, 2014 and June 1, 2015 were prepared using the OPM back-solve approach.\nPWERM\nUnder the PWERM methodology, the fair value of a company's common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.\nHybrid Method\nThe hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM. In the hybrid method used by us, we considered two types of future-event scenarios: an IPO and an unspecified liquidity event. The enterprise value for the IPO scenario was determined using the guideline public company, or GPC, method under the market approach. The enterprise value for the unspecified liquidity event scenario was determined using the GPC method or the OPM back-solve approach. The relative probability of each type of future-event scenario was determined based on an analysis of market conditions at the time, including then-current IPO valuations of similarly situated companies, and our expectations as to the timing and likely prospects of the future-event scenarios.\nIn our application of the GPC method, we considered publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that recently completed IPOs as indicators of our estimated future value in an IPO. We then discounted that future value back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. We applied a discount for lack of marketability to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market.\nOur contemporaneous common stock valuations as of August 4, 2015 and October 23, 2015 and our retrospective common stock valuations as of April 16, 2015, June 1, 2015, and September 14, 2015 were prepared using the hybrid method.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollar Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,629 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,629 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,846 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,073 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,773 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,095 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,650 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,445 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,941 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,723 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,218 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense, net:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,445) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(928) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36,517) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(143) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(109) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,588) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(962) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36,626) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(72,900) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13,685) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(59,215) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and represented revenue recognized pursuant to our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics that we entered into in May 2015.

The increase was primarily related to a $0.9 million increase in our Series A preferred stock tranche right liability during 2014 resulting from mark-to-market adjustments. Additionally, interest expense increased by $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from zero for the period ended December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nFrom inception through December 31, 2015, we funded our operations primarily through proceeds from private placements of our preferred stock of $163.3 million, an up-front payment under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics of $25.0 million, and $2.0 million of gross proceeds from an equipment loan financing. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $143.2 million, which amount does not include $97.8 million in net proceeds from our IPO in February 2016.\nIn December 2015, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Editas Securities Corporation, a Delaware corporation, for the sole purpose of buying, selling, and holding securities on our behalf.\nIndebtedness\nIn May 2014, we entered into an equipment loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which permitted us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 million. We borrowed $0.5 million in July 2014, an additional $0.8 million in January 2015, and $0.7 million in July 2015. Each borrowing was payable in equal monthly principal installments over 36 months beginning after the nine-month anniversary of the funding date of each borrowing under the loans. Interest accrued under the Silicon Valley Bank agreement at an annual rate of 2.75% above the greater of the prime rate and 3.25%. In December 2015, we paid off all amounts outstanding under the loans and terminated the equipment loan agreement. In connection with the Silicon Valley Bank loans, we issued to Silicon Valley Bank a warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant had a 10 year term. Following a reverse stock split in January 2016 and the closing of our IPO in February 2016, such warrant converted into a warrant to purchase 23,076 shares of our common stock, which SVB fully exercised pursuant to a net exercise provision for an aggregate of 19,271 shares of our common stock.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, respectively (in thousands):\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPeriod from\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nSeptember 3, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Inception) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,403) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,655) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(928) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,431) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,217) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,391 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,483 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,993 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,557 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,611 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,012 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.7 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $3.3 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase of $36.5 million in non-cash expense from the mark to market of our preferred stock tranche liability, anti-dilutive protection liability, and warrant liability; an increase of $25.3 million of deferred revenue under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics during the year ended December 31, 2015; an increase of $2.7 million in accrued expenses; and an increase of $3.5 million and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and non-cash depreciation expense, respectively. These increases were partially offset by an\nincrease in net loss of $59.2 million, a decrease in cash flows attributable to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $3.6 million, and other changes that net to $0.9 million related to deferred rent, non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt and research and development expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.7 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $7.8 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the period ended December 31, 2013, partially offset by an increase in cash flows attributable to non-cash expenses of $2.0 million and an increase in cash flows attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.9 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of laboratory equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $1.1 million in cash used in investing activities was due to purchases of laboratory equipment and our facility build out.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $139.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $120.9 million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series A-2 and Series B preferred stock, net of issuance costs, in 2015, resulting in an increase in aggregate gross proceeds of $123.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and proceeds from an increase in borrowings under the equipment loan of $1.0 million. This increase was partially offset by payoff of the equipment loan of $2.1 million and the payment of deferred initial public offering costs of $1.7 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $18.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $15.5 million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series A-1 preferred stock, net of issuance costs, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $18.0 million during 2014.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we further advance our current research programs and our preclinical development activities; seek to identify product candidates and additional research programs; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we identify and develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, and distribution are not the responsibility of a collaborator. We do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize a product candidate. Furthermore, following the closing of our IPO, we have begun to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe expect that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, anticipated interest income, and anticipated research support under our collaboration agreement with Juno Therapeutics, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 367: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for the product candidates we may develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of the product candidates we may develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe success of our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 372: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwhether Juno Therapeutics exercises either or both of its options to extend the research program term under our collaboration (each of which would trigger an extension payment to us);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 374: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other medicines and technologies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, any product candidate that we identify and develop, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of genomic medicines that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 376: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating sublease commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 377: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe sublease space at 300 Third Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires in September 2016.

We have not included such potential obligations in the table above because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty. For further information regarding these agreements and amounts that could become payable in the future under these agreements, please see Item 1. Business-License Agreements.\u201d Pursuant to our license agreement with Broad and Harvard, we have paid an aggregate of $9.4 million and $1.7 million, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for reimbursement of expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications licensed to us under such license agreement, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, any opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection (described in more detail in Item 1. Business-License Agreements - The Broad Institute and President and Fellows of Harvard College License Agreement\u201d). Given the interference and opposition proceedings involving the patents licensed to us under this license agreement are ongoing (described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d), we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for these expenses during future periods will increase substantially until such interference and opposition proceedings are resolved.\nOur agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial milestones. The maximum potential milestone payments under one of our licensing agreements are approximately $5.5 million. The maximum potential milestone payments under another of our licensing agreements are approximately $0.6 million in the aggregate per licensed product.\nUnder a license agreement with certain research institutions, we may also be obligated to pay clinical and regulatory milestones of up to $14.8 million per product approved in the United States, European Union, and Japan for the treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States, as well as potential commercial milestones of up to $54.0 million. In addition, we may be obligated to pay additional clinical and regulatory milestones of up to $4.1 million per product approved in the United States and at least one jurisdiction outside the Unites States for the treatment of human disease based on certain criteria, as well as potential\ncommercial milestones of up to $36.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the treatment of a rare disease meeting certain criteria.\nWe also may be obligated to pay royalties of low single digit to low double digits as a percentage of net product sales depending on the terms of the applicable agreement.\nUnder the terms of our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Juno Therapeutics. In addition, we will receive up to $22.0 million in research support over the next five years across the three programs under our collaboration, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and we are each obligated to use diligent efforts to perform all activities for which we are responsible under the collaboration.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations, or CROs, to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company,\u201d or EGC, may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC is permitted to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (1) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (2) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC.\nInternal Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we concluded that the material weakness that was previously disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-208856), or the Registration Statement, had been remediated as of December 31, 2015. See Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Internal Controls and Procedures\u201d contained in the Registration Statement for disclosure of information about such material weakness. We determined that this material weakness had been remediated as of December 31, 2015 as a result of the corrective measures we described in the Registration Statement as having been completed.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with genetically defined diseases by correcting their disease-causing genes. Our mission is to translate the promise of genome editing science into a broad class of transformative genomic medicines to benefit the greatest number of patients. To this end, we are developing a proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Our product development strategy is to target genetically defined diseases with an initial focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. We are advancing over a dozen discovery research programs, including programs to address genetic, infectious, and oncologic diseases of the liver, lung, blood, eye, and muscle. Our most advanced program is designed to address a specific genetic form of retinal degeneration called Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, a disease with no available therapies or potential treatments in clinical trials in either the United States or European Union. We aim to initiate a clinical trial in this program in 2017. In May 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, to develop novel engineered T cell therapies for cancer.\nSince our inception in September 2013, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, assembling our core capabilities in genome editing, seeking to identify potential product candidates, and undertaking preclinical studies. All of our research programs are still in the preclinical or research stage of development and their risk of failure is high. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the initial public offering of our common stock, or IPO, private placements of our preferred stock, and our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. From inception through December 31, 2015, we raised an aggregate of $190.3 million to fund our operations, consisting of $163.3 million of gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock, a $25.0 million up-front payment under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, and $2.0 million of gross proceeds from an equipment loan financing.\nOn February 8, 2016, we completed our IPO and sold 6,785,000 shares of our common stock, including 885,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $16.00 per share for an aggregate offering of approximately $108.6 million. We received aggregate net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $97.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $72.9 million, $13.7 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $88.3 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we continue our current research programs and our preclinical development activities; seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; further develop our genome editing platform; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We do not expect to be profitable for the year ending December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.6 million of collaboration revenue related to our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. As of December 31, 2015, we had not received any milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. For additional information about our revenue recognition policy related to the collaboration, see the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue.\u201d\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue will be generated from our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics and any other collaborations we may enter into.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies under our research programs, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 costs of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf; \n \u00b7 costs of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical activities and in manufacturing preclinical study materials; \n \u00b7 consultant fees; \n \u00b7 facility costs including rent, depreciation, and maintenance expenses; and \n \u00b7 fees for maintaining licenses under our third-party licensing agreements. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates we may identify and develop. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u00b7 successful completion of preclinical studies and Investigational New Drug-enabling studies; \n \u00b7 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity; \n \u00b7 launching commercial sales of the product, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u00b7 acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors; \n \u00b7 effectively competing with other therapies and treatment options; \n \u00b7 a continued acceptable safety profile following approval; \n \u00b7 enforcing and defending intellectual property and proprietary rights and claims; and \n \u00b7 achieving desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any product candidates we may develop would significantly change the costs, timing, and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nOther than in connection with our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we do not track research and development costs on a program-by-program basis as we have not yet identified a product candidate for advancement into clinical trials. We plan to track research and development costs for any individual development program when we identify a product candidate from the program that we believe we can advance into clinical trials.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development programs progress, including as we continue to support the preclinical studies for our LCA10 program as well as our other research programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development, legal, and human resource functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of any product candidates we identify and develop. These increases will include increased costs associated with the lease of a new facility for our headquarters and will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, and fees to outside consultants. We also anticipate increased expenses related to reimbursement of third-party patent-related expenses and increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs for audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. With respect to reimbursement of third-party patent-related expenses specifically, given the ongoing nature of the interference and opposition proceedings involving the patents licensed to us under our license agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard (described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d), we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses related to these proceedings during future periods will increase substantially until such interference and opposition proceedings are resolved.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of re-measurement gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the tranche rights associated with our Series A-1 preferred stock, warrant liability associated with the warrant we issued to our equipment loan lender, and the anti-dilutive protection liability associated with our issuance of common stock to certain licensors. In June 2015, upon the issuance of the final tranche of our Series A preferred stock, the tranche right liability was settled and reclassified to Series A preferred stock and the anti-dilutive protection liability was settled and reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. Therefore no further re-measurement gains or losses will be recognized related to the tranche rights or the anti-dilutive protection liability. In connection with the closing of our IPO, all of our preferred stock converted into common stock on a 2.6-for-one basis.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nAs of December 31, 2015, all of our revenue to date had been generated exclusively from our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u00b7 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u00b7 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; \n \u00b7 the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and \n \u00b7 collectability is reasonably assured. \nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nDetermination of Accounting Units\nWe analyze multiple element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within our control. In assessing whether an item under a collaboration has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider whether our collaboration partner can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s), and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).\nOptions under a collaboration are considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the cost to exercise the option, the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaboration partner might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, and the likelihood the option will be exercised. When an option is considered substantive, we would not consider the option or item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated option fees are not included in allocable consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, when an option is not considered substantive, we would consider the option, including other deliverables contingent upon the exercise of the option, to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in allocable arrangement consideration. In addition, if the price of the option includes a significant incremental discount, the discount would be included as a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement.\nAllocation of Arrangement Consideration\nArrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. The applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE or TPE is available. We have only used BESP to estimate selling price, since we have not had VSOE or TPE of selling price for any units of accounting to date. Determining BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the applicable agreement and estimated costs. We validate BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used by us to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nPattern of Recognition\nWe recognize the arrangement's consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize revenue associated with licenses, license options, or the discount related to a license option upon (i) delivery of the license or (ii) the earlier of exercise or expiration of the license option, if the underlying license has standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided after delivering that license. If the license does not have standalone value, the amounts allocated to the license will be combined with the related undelivered items as a single unit of accounting.\nWe recognize the amounts associated with collaboration research and development services, joint research committees, or other services ratably over the associated period of performance. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period that we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the collaboration partner can be determined and objectively measureable performance exists, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative revenue earned determined using the straight line method or proportional performance, as applicable, as of the period end date.\nRecognition of Milestones and Royalties\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonably\nrelative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestones and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestones in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. In accordance with ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, a clinical or regulatory milestone that is considered substantive will be recognized as revenue in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive would be recognized as revenue over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue from a commercial milestone payment will be accounted for as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWe will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying contract terms, provided that the reported sales are reliably measurable, we have no remaining performance obligations, and assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe record our expenses related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nFair Value Measurements\nTranche Rights\nThe Series A preferred stock purchase agreement that we entered into provided the investors with the right, upon achievement of certain milestones, to participate in subsequent offerings of Series A preferred stock, which we refer to as tranche rights. The tranche rights meet the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as the tranche rights are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series A preferred stock. Since the Series A preferred stock was redeemable at the holder's option subject to certain limitations, the tranche rights were classified as an asset or\nliability and were initially recorded at fair value and then marked to market at each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement of the tranche rights.\nWe determined fair value utilizing the concept of Fair Value\u201d from ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, or ASC 820, which states that any fair value measurement requires that the reporting entity to determine the valuation technique(s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorized.\nThe estimated fair value of the tranche rights was determined using a probability-weighted present value model that considered the probability and timing of closing a tranche, the estimated future value of the Series A preferred stock to be issued at each closing, and the amount of the investment required at each closing. Future values were converted to present value using a discount rate appropriate for probability-adjusted cash flows. Upon the settlement of each tranche, the fair value of the tranche rights associated with that tranche was reclassified to Series A preferred stock at its then fair value and thereafter was no longer re-measured.\nWarrants\nIn conjunction with an equipment loan financing, we issued to Silicon Valley Bank a warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The fair value of the warrant at the issuance date was recorded as a reduction to face value of the debt balance and was amortized as interest expense, along with other debt issuance costs, over the term of the loan. Due to the liquidation preferences of the Series A-1 preferred stock, we recorded the warrant as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Following a reverse stock split in January 2016 and the closing of our IPO in February 2016, such warrant converted into a warrant to purchase 23,076 shares of our common stock, which Silicon Valley Bank fully exercised in February 2016 pursuant to a net exercise provision for an aggregate of 19,271 shares of our common stock.\nAnti-dilutive Protection Liability\nPursuant to agreements with licensors and in consideration for licenses received, we paid certain institutions upfront payments in cash, issued shares of common stock equal to a certain percentage of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, and granted to the institutions the right to receive future issuances of common stock to maintain their respective ownership percentages of our company through the final tranche of our Series A preferred stock financing that ultimately occurred in June 2015. The anti-dilutive protection obligation under these agreements met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument and the obligation was legally detachable and separately exercisable from the original issuance of the common stock. We concluded that the anti-dilutive protection obligation represented a liability because the anti-dilutive feature represented a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares and the monetary value of the obligation was based on something other than the fair value of the equity shares. As such, we recorded the initial value of the obligation at the issuance date as research and development expense (considered additional consideration paid to the licensors) and the liability was marked to market at each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement date.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based compensation awards to employees, including grants of restricted stock and stock options, to be recognized as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of certain subjective assumptions, including (1) the expected stock price volatility, (2) the calculation of expected term of the award, (3) the risk-free interest rate, and (4) the expected dividend yield. Because there had been no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, there is a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data. Accordingly, we base our estimates of expected volatility on\nthe historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. We calculate historical volatility based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term. We compute expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a representative group of companies with similar characteristics to us, including their stages of product development and focus on the life science industry. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term. We determine the risk-free interest rate based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. We use an assumed dividend yield of zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on common stock.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees were as follows:\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n87.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.25 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.25 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRisk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted to non-employees were as follows:\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n80.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n9.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRisk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense the fair value of stock-based compensation awards granted to employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the period in which the related services are received. We measure stock-based compensation awards granted to non-employees at fair value as the awards vest and recognize the resulting value as stock-based compensation expense during the period the related services are rendered. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we re-measure the unvested portion of these awards.\nWe record the expense for stock-based compensation awards subject to performance-based milestone vesting over the remaining service period when management determines that achievement of the milestone is probable. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date.\nAward Grants\nThe

various objective and subjective factors described below. \n (2) The fair value of common stock at the grant date was adjusted in connection with a retrospective fair value assessment for financial reporting purposes. \nStock-based compensation totaled approximately $3.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $9.1 million and $6.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock option awards, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 1.6 and 3.5 years, respectively. We expect the impact of our stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options granted to employees and non-employees to grow in future periods due to the potential increases in the value of our common stock and headcount.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock on Grant Dates\nWe historically have granted stock options and restricted stock at exercise or purchase prices not less than the fair value of our common stock. Due to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the commencement of trading of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 3, 2016 in connection with our IPO, the estimated fair values of our common stock as of the grant dates prior to our IPO were determined contemporaneously by our board of directors. Since 2014, our board of directors' determinations have involved the preparation of valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid. Following our IPO, it is no longer necessary for us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for stock options or other equity awards, as the fair value of our common stock can be determined by reference to its closing price on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of the applicable grant.\nFollowing our entry into license agreements with The Broad Institute, Inc., the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, our board of directors performed common stock valuations, with the assistance of a third-party\nvaluation specialist, as of October 31, 2014, June 1, 2015, August 4, 2015, and October 23, 2015, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $0.65, $3.23, $6.48, and $11.21 per share, respectively, as of those dates. In conducting its valuations, our board of directors considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including its best estimate of our business condition, prospects, and operating performance at each valuation date. Within the valuations performed, a range of factors, assumptions, and methodologies were used. The significant factors included:\n \u00b7 the lack of an active public market for our common and our convertible preferred stock; \n \u00b7 the prices of shares of our convertible preferred stock that we had sold to outside investors in arm's length transactions, and the rights, preferences, and privileges of that convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock; \n \u00b7 our results of operations and financial condition; \n \u00b7 the entry into license agreements, pursuant to which we obtained rights to important intellectual property; \n \u00b7 the material risks related to our business; \n \u00b7 our business strategy; \n \u00b7 the market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors; and \n \u00b7 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our common stock, such as an initial public offering, given prevailing market conditions. \nFor financial reporting purposes, we also performed common stock valuations retrospectively, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, as of April 16, 2015, June 1, 2015, and September 14, 2015, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $4.84, $5.91, and $8.92 per share, respectively, as of those dates. Our retrospective valuations were prepared in accordance with the guidelines in the Practice Aid following the methodologies described below.\nThere are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates have included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to complete an IPO or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss, and net loss per share applicable to common stockholders could have been significantly different.\nCommon Stock Valuation Methodologies\nOur common stock valuations were prepared using the option-pricing method, or OPM, and a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, and the OPM.\nOPM\nThe OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In this model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call\noption with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the convertible preferred stock liquidation preference is paid.\nThe OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. This model defines the securities' fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event and the estimated volatility of the equity securities. The aggregate value of the common stock derived from the OPM is then divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding to arrive at the per share value.\nWe used the OPM back-solve approach to estimate enterprise value under the OPM. The OPM back-solve approach uses the OPM to derive an implied equity value for one type of a company's equity securities from a contemporaneous sale transaction involving another type of the company's equity securities. For the OPM, we based our assumed volatility factor on the historical trading volatility of our publicly traded peer companies. At each valuation date, we determined the appropriate volatility to be used, considering such factors as our expected time to a liquidity event and our stage of development.\nTo derive the fair value of our common stock using the OPM, we calculated the proceeds to our common stockholders based on the preferences and priorities of our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We then applied a discount for lack of marketability to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market.\nOur contemporaneous common stock valuations as of October 31, 2014 and June 1, 2015 were prepared using the OPM back-solve approach.\nPWERM\nUnder the PWERM methodology, the fair value of a company's common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.\nHybrid Method\nThe hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM. In the hybrid method used by us, we considered two types of future-event scenarios: an IPO and an unspecified liquidity event. The enterprise value for the IPO scenario was determined using the guideline public company, or GPC, method under the market approach. The enterprise value for the unspecified liquidity event scenario was determined using the GPC method or the OPM back-solve approach. The relative probability of each type of future-event scenario was determined based on an analysis of market conditions at the time, including then-current IPO valuations of similarly situated companies, and our expectations as to the timing and likely prospects of the future-event scenarios.\nIn our application of the GPC method, we considered publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that recently completed IPOs as indicators of our estimated future value in an IPO. We then discounted that future value back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. We applied a discount for lack of marketability to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market.\nOur contemporaneous common stock valuations as of August 4, 2015 and October 23, 2015 and our retrospective common stock valuations as of April 16, 2015, June 1, 2015, and September 14, 2015 were prepared using the hybrid method.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollar Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,629 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,629 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,846 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,073 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,773 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,095 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,650 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,445 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,941 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,723 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,218 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense, net:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,445) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(928) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36,517) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(143) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(109) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,588) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(962) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36,626) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(72,900) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13,685) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(59,215) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and represented revenue recognized pursuant to our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics that we entered into in May 2015.

The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to 12 months of operations being included in 2014 versus four months of operations during 2013 and included the following:\n \u00b7 approximately $3.5 million in increased patent and license fees, including third-party costs to procure the application for and issuance of additional patents in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and for intellectual property matters; \n \u00b7 approximately $1.3 million in increased employee compensation costs, and $0.6 million in increased contractor and third-party consulting expenses; and \n \u00b7 approximately $0.5 million in increased facility costs, including rent, utilities, and depreciation expense. \nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $18,000 for the period ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to a $0.9 million increase in our Series A preferred stock tranche right liability during 2014 resulting from mark-to-market adjustments. Additionally, interest expense increased by $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from zero for the period ended December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nFrom inception through December 31, 2015, we funded our operations primarily through proceeds from private placements of our preferred stock of $163.3 million, an up-front payment under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics of $25.0 million, and $2.0 million of gross proceeds from an equipment loan financing. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $143.2 million, which amount does not include $97.8 million in net proceeds from our IPO in February 2016.\nIn December 2015, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Editas Securities Corporation, a Delaware corporation, for the sole purpose of buying, selling, and holding securities on our behalf.\nIndebtedness\nIn May 2014, we entered into an equipment loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which permitted us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 million. We borrowed $0.5 million in July 2014, an additional $0.8 million in January 2015, and $0.7 million in July 2015. Each borrowing was payable in equal monthly principal installments over 36 months beginning after the nine-month anniversary of the funding date of each borrowing under the loans. Interest accrued under the Silicon Valley Bank agreement at an annual rate of 2.75% above the greater of the prime rate and 3.25%. In December 2015, we paid off all amounts outstanding under the loans and terminated the equipment loan agreement. In connection with the Silicon Valley Bank loans, we issued to Silicon Valley Bank a warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant had a 10 year term. Following a reverse stock split in January 2016 and the closing of our IPO in February 2016, such warrant converted into a warrant to purchase 23,076 shares of our common stock, which SVB fully exercised pursuant to a net exercise provision for an aggregate of 19,271 shares of our common stock.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, respectively (in thousands):\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPeriod from\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nSeptember 3, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Inception) to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,403) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,655) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(928) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,431) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,217) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,391 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,483 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,993 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,557 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,611 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,012 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.7 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $3.3 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase of $36.5 million in non-cash expense from the mark to market of our preferred stock tranche liability, anti-dilutive protection liability, and warrant liability; an increase of $25.3 million of deferred revenue under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics during the year ended December 31, 2015; an increase of $2.7 million in accrued expenses; and an increase of $3.5 million and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and non-cash depreciation expense, respectively. These increases were partially offset by an\nincrease in net loss of $59.2 million, a decrease in cash flows attributable to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $3.6 million, and other changes that net to $0.9 million related to deferred rent, non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt and research and development expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.7 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $7.8 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the period ended December 31, 2013, partially offset by an increase in cash flows attributable to non-cash expenses of $2.0 million and an increase in cash flows attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.9 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of laboratory equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $1.1 million in cash used in investing activities was due to purchases of laboratory equipment and our facility build out.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $139.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $120.9 million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series A-2 and Series B preferred stock, net of issuance costs, in 2015, resulting in an increase in aggregate gross proceeds of $123.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and proceeds from an increase in borrowings under the equipment loan of $1.0 million. This increase was partially offset by payoff of the equipment loan of $2.1 million and the payment of deferred initial public offering costs of $1.7 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $18.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $15.5 million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series A-1 preferred stock, net of issuance costs, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $18.0 million during 2014.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we further advance our current research programs and our preclinical development activities; seek to identify product candidates and additional research programs; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we identify and develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, and distribution are not the responsibility of a collaborator. We do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize a product candidate. Furthermore, following the closing of our IPO, we have begun to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe expect that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, anticipated interest income, and anticipated research support under our collaboration agreement with Juno Therapeutics, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for the product candidates we may develop; \n \u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u00b7 the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of the product candidates we may develop; \n \u00b7 the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; \n \u00b7 the success of our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics; \n \u00b7 whether Juno Therapeutics exercises either or both of its options to extend the research program term under our collaboration (each of which would trigger an extension payment to us); \n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; \n \u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other medicines and technologies; and \n \u00b7 the costs of operating as a public company. \nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, any product candidate that we identify and develop, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of genomic medicines that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 376: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating sublease commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We sublease space at 300 Third Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires in September 2016. In addition, we sublease space at 675 W Kendall Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts under an operating lease that expires November 2016. \n (2) In February 2016, we entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which we intend to relocate to in the fall of 2016. Under the terms of the lease, we will lease approximately 59,783 square feet at $65.00 per square foot per year in base rent, which base rent is subject to scheduled annual increases, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and an additional rent of approximately $0.926 per square foot per year related to certain tenant improvements to the space. The contractual obligations for this lease are not reflected in the table above. The lease will continue until the end of the 84th full calendar month following the first day of the first full month immediately following the commencement of the lease. We have the option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term. \nThe table above does not include potential milestone fees, sublicense fees, royalty fees, licensing maintenance fees, and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs that we may be required to pay under agreements we have entered into with certain institutions to license intellectual property. We have not included such potential obligations in the table above because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty. For further information regarding these agreements and amounts that could become payable in the future under these agreements, please see Item 1. Business-License Agreements.\u201d Pursuant to our license agreement with Broad and Harvard, we have paid an aggregate of $9.4 million and $1.7 million, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for reimbursement of expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications licensed to us under such license agreement, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, any opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection (described in more detail in Item 1. Business-License Agreements - The Broad Institute and President and Fellows of Harvard College License Agreement\u201d). Given the interference and opposition proceedings involving the patents licensed to us under this license agreement are ongoing (described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d), we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for these expenses during future periods will increase substantially until such interference and opposition proceedings are resolved.\nOur agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial milestones. The maximum potential milestone payments under one of our licensing agreements are approximately $5.5 million. The maximum potential milestone payments under another of our licensing agreements are approximately $0.6 million in the aggregate per licensed product.\nUnder a license agreement with certain research institutions, we may also be obligated to pay clinical and regulatory milestones of up to $14.8 million per product approved in the United States, European Union, and Japan for the treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States, as well as potential commercial milestones of up to $54.0 million. In addition, we may be obligated to pay additional clinical and regulatory milestones of up to $4.1 million per product approved in the United States and at least one jurisdiction outside the Unites States for the treatment of human disease based on certain criteria, as well as potential\ncommercial milestones of up to $36.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the treatment of a rare disease meeting certain criteria.\nWe also may be obligated to pay royalties of low single digit to low double digits as a percentage of net product sales depending on the terms of the applicable agreement.\nUnder the terms of our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Juno Therapeutics. In addition, we will receive up to $22.0 million in research support over the next five years across the three programs under our collaboration, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and we are each obligated to use diligent efforts to perform all activities for which we are responsible under the collaboration.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations, or CROs, to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company,\u201d or EGC, may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC is permitted to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (1) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (2) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC.\nInternal Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we concluded that the material weakness that was previously disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-208856), or the Registration Statement, had been remediated as of December 31, 2015. See Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Internal Controls and Procedures\u201d contained in the Registration Statement for disclosure of information about such material weakness. We determined that this material weakness had been remediated as of December 31, 2015 as a result of the corrective measures we described in the Registration Statement as having been completed.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with genetically defined diseases by correcting their disease-causing genes. Our mission is to translate the promise of genome editing science into a broad class of transformative genomic medicines to benefit the greatest number of patients. To this end, we are developing a proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Our product development strategy is to target genetically defined diseases with an initial focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. We are advancing over a dozen discovery research programs, including programs to address genetic, infectious, and oncologic diseases of the liver, lung, blood, eye, and muscle. Our most advanced program is designed to address a specific genetic form of retinal degeneration called Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, a disease with no available therapies or potential treatments in clinical trials in either the United States or European Union. We aim to initiate a clinical trial in this program in 2017. In May 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, to develop novel engineered T cell therapies for cancer.\nSince our inception in September 2013, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, assembling our core capabilities in genome editing, seeking to identify potential product candidates, and undertaking preclinical studies. All of our research programs are still in the preclinical or research stage of development and their risk of failure is high. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the initial public offering of our common stock, or IPO, private placements of our preferred stock, and our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. From inception through December 31, 2015, we raised an aggregate of $190.3 million to fund our operations, consisting of $163.3 million of gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock, a $25.0 million up-front payment under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, and $2.0 million of gross proceeds from an equipment loan financing.\nOn February 8, 2016, we completed our IPO and sold 6,785,000 shares of our common stock, including 885,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $16.00 per share for an aggregate offering of approximately $108.6 million. We received aggregate net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $97.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $72.9 million, $13.7 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $88.3 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we continue our current research programs and our preclinical development activities; seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; further develop our genome editing platform; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We do not expect to be profitable for the year ending December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.6 million of collaboration revenue related to our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. As of December 31, 2015, we had not received any milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. For additional information about our revenue recognition policy related to the collaboration, see the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue.\u201d\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue will be generated from our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics and any other collaborations we may enter into.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies under our research programs, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 costs of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf; \n \u00b7 costs of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical activities and in manufacturing preclinical study materials; \n \u00b7 consultant fees; \n \u00b7 facility costs including rent, depreciation, and maintenance expenses; and \n \u00b7 fees for maintaining licenses under our third-party licensing agreements. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates we may identify and develop. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u00b7 successful completion of preclinical studies and Investigational New Drug-enabling studies; \n \u00b7 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity; \n \u00b7 launching commercial sales of the product, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u00b7 acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors; \n \u00b7 effectively competing with other therapies and treatment options; \n \u00b7 a continued acceptable safety profile following approval; \n \u00b7 enforcing and defending intellectual property and proprietary rights and claims; and \n \u00b7 achieving desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any product candidates we may develop would significantly change the costs, timing, and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nOther than in connection with our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we do not track research and development costs on a program-by-program basis as we have not yet identified a product candidate for advancement into clinical trials. We plan to track research and development costs for any individual development program when we identify a product candidate from the program that we believe we can advance into clinical trials.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development programs progress, including as we continue to support the preclinical studies for our LCA10 program as well as our other research programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development, legal, and human resource functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of any product candidates we identify and develop. These increases will include increased costs associated with the lease of a new facility for our headquarters and will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, and fees to outside consultants. We also anticipate increased expenses related to reimbursement of third-party patent-related expenses and increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs for audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. With respect to reimbursement of third-party patent-related expenses specifically, given the ongoing nature of the interference and opposition proceedings involving the patents licensed to us under our license agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard (described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d), we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses related to these proceedings during future periods will increase substantially until such interference and opposition proceedings are resolved.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of re-measurement gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the tranche rights associated with our Series A-1 preferred stock, warrant liability associated with the warrant we issued to our equipment loan lender, and the anti-dilutive protection liability associated with our issuance of common stock to certain licensors. In June 2015, upon the issuance of the final tranche of our Series A preferred stock, the tranche right liability was settled and reclassified to Series A preferred stock and the anti-dilutive protection liability was settled and reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. Therefore no further re-measurement gains or losses will be recognized related to the tranche rights or the anti-dilutive protection liability. In connection with the closing of our IPO, all of our preferred stock converted into common stock on a 2.6-for-one basis.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nAs of December 31, 2015, all of our revenue to date had been generated exclusively from our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u00b7 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u00b7 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; \n \u00b7 the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and \n \u00b7 collectability is reasonably assured. \nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nDetermination of Accounting Units\nWe analyze multiple element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within our control. In assessing whether an item under a collaboration has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider whether our collaboration partner can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s), and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).\nOptions under a collaboration are considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the cost to exercise the option, the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaboration partner might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, and the likelihood the option will be exercised. When an option is considered substantive, we would not consider the option or item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated option fees are not included in allocable consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, when an option is not considered substantive, we would consider the option, including other deliverables contingent upon the exercise of the option, to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in allocable arrangement consideration. In addition, if the price of the option includes a significant incremental discount, the discount would be included as a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement.\nAllocation of Arrangement Consideration\nArrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. The applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE or TPE is available. We have only used BESP to estimate selling price, since we have not had VSOE or TPE of selling price for any units of accounting to date. Determining BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the applicable agreement and estimated costs. We validate BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used by us to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nPattern of Recognition\nWe recognize the arrangement's consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize revenue associated with licenses, license options, or the discount related to a license option upon (i) delivery of the license or (ii) the earlier of exercise or expiration of the license option, if the underlying license has standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided after delivering that license. If the license does not have standalone value, the amounts allocated to the license will be combined with the related undelivered items as a single unit of accounting.\nWe recognize the amounts associated with collaboration research and development services, joint research committees, or other services ratably over the associated period of performance. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period that we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the collaboration partner can be determined and objectively measureable performance exists, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative revenue earned determined using the straight line method or proportional performance, as applicable, as of the period end date.\nRecognition of Milestones and Royalties\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonably\nrelative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestones and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestones in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. In accordance with ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, a clinical or regulatory milestone that is considered substantive will be recognized as revenue in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive would be recognized as revenue over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue from a commercial milestone payment will be accounted for as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWe will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying contract terms, provided that the reported sales are reliably measurable, we have no remaining performance obligations, and assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe record our expenses related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nFair Value Measurements\nTranche Rights\nThe Series A preferred stock purchase agreement that we entered into provided the investors with the right, upon achievement of certain milestones, to participate in subsequent offerings of Series A preferred stock, which we refer to as tranche rights. The tranche rights meet the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as the tranche rights are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series A preferred stock. Since the Series A preferred stock was redeemable at the holder's option subject to certain limitations, the tranche rights were classified as an asset or\nliability and were initially recorded at fair value and then marked to market at each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement of the tranche rights.\nWe determined fair value utilizing the concept of Fair Value\u201d from ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, or ASC 820, which states that any fair value measurement requires that the reporting entity to determine the valuation technique(s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorized.\nThe estimated fair value of the tranche rights was determined using a probability-weighted present value model that considered the probability and timing of closing a tranche, the estimated future value of the Series A preferred stock to be issued at each closing, and the amount of the investment required at each closing. Future values were converted to present value using a discount rate appropriate for probability-adjusted cash flows. Upon the settlement of each tranche, the fair value of the tranche rights associated with that tranche was reclassified to Series A preferred stock at its then fair value and thereafter was no longer re-measured.\nWarrants\nIn conjunction with an equipment loan financing, we issued to Silicon Valley Bank a warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The fair value of the warrant at the issuance date was recorded as a reduction to face value of the debt balance and was amortized as interest expense, along with other debt issuance costs, over the term of the loan. Due to the liquidation preferences of the Series A-1 preferred stock, we recorded the warrant as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Following a reverse stock split in January 2016 and the closing of our IPO in February 2016, such warrant converted into a warrant to purchase 23,076 shares of our common stock, which Silicon Valley Bank fully exercised in February 2016 pursuant to a net exercise provision for an aggregate of 19,271 shares of our common stock.\nAnti-dilutive Protection Liability\nPursuant to agreements with licensors and in consideration for licenses received, we paid certain institutions upfront payments in cash, issued shares of common stock equal to a certain percentage of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, and granted to the institutions the right to receive future issuances of common stock to maintain their respective ownership percentages of our company through the final tranche of our Series A preferred stock financing that ultimately occurred in June 2015. The anti-dilutive protection obligation under these agreements met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument and the obligation was legally detachable and separately exercisable from the original issuance of the common stock. We concluded that the anti-dilutive protection obligation represented a liability because the anti-dilutive feature represented a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares and the monetary value of the obligation was based on something other than the fair value of the equity shares. As such, we recorded the initial value of the obligation at the issuance date as research and development expense (considered additional consideration paid to the licensors) and the liability was marked to market at each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement date.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based compensation awards to employees, including grants of restricted stock and stock options, to be recognized as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of certain subjective assumptions, including (1) the expected stock price volatility, (2) the calculation of expected term of the award, (3) the risk-free interest rate, and (4) the expected dividend yield. Because there had been no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, there is a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data. Accordingly, we base our estimates of expected volatility on\nthe historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. We calculate historical volatility based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term. We compute expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a representative group of companies with similar characteristics to us, including their stages of product development and focus on the life science industry. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term. We determine the risk-free interest rate based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. We use an assumed dividend yield of zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on common stock.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees were as follows:\n\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted to non-employees were as follows:\n\nWe expense the fair value of stock-based compensation awards granted to employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the period in which the related services are received. We measure stock-based compensation awards granted to non-employees at fair value as the awards vest and recognize the resulting value as stock-based compensation expense during the period the related services are rendered. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we re-measure the unvested portion of these awards.\nWe record the expense for stock-based compensation awards subject to performance-based milestone vesting over the remaining service period when management determines that achievement of the milestone is probable. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date.\nAward Grants\nThe following table summarizes by grant date the number of shares of restricted common stock and common stock subject to options granted between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, the per share purchase or exercise prices, the fair value of the common stock on the dates of grant, and the estimated fair value per share utilized to calculate stock-based compensation expense.\n\n (1) Represents the determination by our board of directors of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, taking into consideration the various objective and subjective factors described below. \n (2) The fair value of common stock at the grant date was adjusted in connection with a retrospective fair value assessment for financial reporting purposes. \nStock-based compensation totaled approximately $3.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $9.1 million and $6.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock option awards, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 1.6 and 3.5 years, respectively. We expect the impact of our stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options granted to employees and non-employees to grow in future periods due to the potential increases in the value of our common stock and headcount.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock on Grant Dates\nWe historically have granted stock options and restricted stock at exercise or purchase prices not less than the fair value of our common stock. Due to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the commencement of trading of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 3, 2016 in connection with our IPO, the estimated fair values of our common stock as of the grant dates prior to our IPO were determined contemporaneously by our board of directors. Since 2014, our board of directors' determinations have involved the preparation of valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid. Following our IPO, it is no longer necessary for us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for stock options or other equity awards, as the fair value of our common stock can be determined by reference to its closing price on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of the applicable grant.\nFollowing our entry into license agreements with The Broad Institute, Inc., the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, our board of directors performed common stock valuations, with the assistance of a third-party\nvaluation specialist, as of October 31, 2014, June 1, 2015, August 4, 2015, and October 23, 2015, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $0.65, $3.23, $6.48, and $11.21 per share, respectively, as of those dates. In conducting its valuations, our board of directors considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including its best estimate of our business condition, prospects, and operating performance at each valuation date. Within the valuations performed, a range of factors, assumptions, and methodologies were used. The significant factors included:\n \u00b7 the lack of an active public market for our common and our convertible preferred stock; \n \u00b7 the prices of shares of our convertible preferred stock that we had sold to outside investors in arm's length transactions, and the rights, preferences, and privileges of that convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock; \n \u00b7 our results of operations and financial condition; \n \u00b7 the entry into license agreements, pursuant to which we obtained rights to important intellectual property; \n \u00b7 the material risks related to our business; \n \u00b7 our business strategy; \n \u00b7 the market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors; and \n \u00b7 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our common stock, such as an initial public offering, given prevailing market conditions. \nFor financial reporting purposes, we also performed common stock valuations retrospectively, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, as of April 16, 2015, June 1, 2015, and September 14, 2015, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $4.84, $5.91, and $8.92 per share, respectively, as of those dates. Our retrospective valuations were prepared in accordance with the guidelines in the Practice Aid following the methodologies described below.\nThere are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates have included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to complete an IPO or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss, and net loss per share applicable to common stockholders could have been significantly different.\nCommon Stock Valuation Methodologies\nOur common stock valuations were prepared using the option-pricing method, or OPM, and a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, and the OPM.\nOPM\nThe OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In this model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call\noption with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the convertible preferred stock liquidation preference is paid.\nThe OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. This model defines the securities' fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event and the estimated volatility of the equity securities. The aggregate value of the common stock derived from the OPM is then divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding to arrive at the per share value.\nWe used the OPM back-solve approach to estimate enterprise value under the OPM. The OPM back-solve approach uses the OPM to derive an implied equity value for one type of a company's equity securities from a contemporaneous sale transaction involving another type of the company's equity securities. For the OPM, we based our assumed volatility factor on the historical trading volatility of our publicly traded peer companies. At each valuation date, we determined the appropriate volatility to be used, considering such factors as our expected time to a liquidity event and our stage of development.\nTo derive the fair value of our common stock using the OPM, we calculated the proceeds to our common stockholders based on the preferences and priorities of our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We then applied a discount for lack of marketability to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market.\nOur contemporaneous common stock valuations as of October 31, 2014 and June 1, 2015 were prepared using the OPM back-solve approach.\nPWERM\nUnder the PWERM methodology, the fair value of a company's common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.\nHybrid Method\nThe hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM. In the hybrid method used by us, we considered two types of future-event scenarios: an IPO and an unspecified liquidity event. The enterprise value for the IPO scenario was determined using the guideline public company, or GPC, method under the market approach. The enterprise value for the unspecified liquidity event scenario was determined using the GPC method or the OPM back-solve approach. The relative probability of each type of future-event scenario was determined based on an analysis of market conditions at the time, including then-current IPO valuations of similarly situated companies, and our expectations as to the timing and likely prospects of the future-event scenarios.\nIn our application of the GPC method, we considered publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that recently completed IPOs as indicators of our estimated future value in an IPO. We then discounted that future value back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. We applied a discount for lack of marketability to the common stock to account for the lack of access to an active public market.\nOur contemporaneous common stock valuations as of August 4, 2015 and October 23, 2015 and our retrospective common stock valuations as of April 16, 2015, June 1, 2015, and September 14, 2015 were prepared using the hybrid method.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and represented revenue recognized pursuant to our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics that we entered into in May 2015. We did not recognize any collaboration revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $13.8 million, to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to:\n \u00b7 approximately $6.3 million in increased research and development employee and contractor compensation costs; \n \u00b7 approximately $3.4 million in increased license fees and expenses due to sublicense payments that were triggered in the year ended December 31, 2015 under agreements with licensors as a result of our entry into our collaboration agreement with Juno Therapeutics; \n \u00b7 approximately $3.1 million in increased process and platform development costs; \n \u00b7 approximately $0.8 million in increased facilities costs, including rent, utilities, and depreciation expense; and \n \u00b7 approximately $0.2 million in increased other expenses. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $10.5 million, to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to:\n \u00b7 approximately $6.2 million in increased patent-related fees, including third-party costs to procure the application for and issuance of additional patents in the United States and other jurisdictions; and \n \u00b7 approximately $2.3 million in increased contractor consulting fees, $1.8 million in increased employee compensation cost, and $0.2 million in other general and administrative expenses. \nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily related to a $35.6 million increase in our Series A preferred stock tranche right liability resulting from mark-to-market adjustments attributable to an increase in the fair value of our Series A preferred stock during 2015. The tranche right liability was settled in June 2015.\nThe increase in other expense, net was also attributable to a $1.6 million mark-to-market adjustment recorded in June 2015 for the anti-dilution protection liability related to our issuance of common stock to our licensors. The anti-dilution liability was settled in June 2015.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 and Period Ended 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nCollaboration Revenue\nWe did not earn any collaboration revenue in either year ended December 31, 2014 or the period ended December 31, 2013.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expense increased by $4.6 million, to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2013. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to:\n \u00b7 approximately $1.1 million in increased license fees; \n \u00b7 approximately $1.1 million in increased employee compensation expense and $0.4 million in increased contractor and third-party consulting expenses; \n \u00b7 approximately $1.0 million in increased facilities costs including rent, utilities, and depreciation expense; and \n \u00b7 approximately $0.9 million in increased laboratory expenses. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $6.4 million, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.2 million for the period ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to 12 months of operations being included in 2014 versus four months of operations during 2013 and included the following:\n \u00b7 approximately $3.5 million in increased patent and license fees, including third-party costs to procure the application for and issuance of additional patents in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and for intellectual property matters; \n \u00b7 approximately $1.3 million in increased employee compensation costs, and $0.6 million in increased contractor and third-party consulting expenses; and \n \u00b7 approximately $0.5 million in increased facility costs, including rent, utilities, and depreciation expense. \nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $18,000 for the period ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to a $0.9 million increase in our Series A preferred stock tranche right liability during 2014 resulting from mark-to-market adjustments. Additionally, interest expense increased by $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from zero for the period ended December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nFrom inception through December 31, 2015, we funded our operations primarily through proceeds from private placements of our preferred stock of $163.3 million, an up-front payment under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics of $25.0 million, and $2.0 million of gross proceeds from an equipment loan financing. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $143.2 million, which amount does not include $97.8 million in net proceeds from our IPO in February 2016.\nIn December 2015, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Editas Securities Corporation, a Delaware corporation, for the sole purpose of buying, selling, and holding securities on our behalf.\nIndebtedness\nIn May 2014, we entered into an equipment loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which permitted us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 million. We borrowed $0.5 million in July 2014, an additional $0.8 million in January 2015, and $0.7 million in July 2015. Each borrowing was payable in equal monthly principal installments over 36 months beginning after the nine-month anniversary of the funding date of each borrowing under the loans. Interest accrued under the Silicon Valley Bank agreement at an annual rate of 2.75% above the greater of the prime rate and 3.25%. In December 2015, we paid off all amounts outstanding under the loans and terminated the equipment loan agreement. In connection with the Silicon Valley Bank loans, we issued to Silicon Valley Bank a warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant had a 10 year term. Following a reverse stock split in January 2016 and the closing of our IPO in February 2016, such warrant converted into a warrant to purchase 23,076 shares of our common stock, which SVB fully exercised pursuant to a net exercise provision for an aggregate of 19,271 shares of our common stock.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period ended December 31, 2013, respectively (in thousands):\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.7 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $3.3 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase of $36.5 million in non-cash expense from the mark to market of our preferred stock tranche liability, anti-dilutive protection liability, and warrant liability; an increase of $25.3 million of deferred revenue under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics during the year ended December 31, 2015; an increase of $2.7 million in accrued expenses; and an increase of $3.5 million and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and non-cash depreciation expense, respectively. These increases were partially offset by an\nincrease in net loss of $59.2 million, a decrease in cash flows attributable to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $3.6 million, and other changes that net to $0.9 million related to deferred rent, non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt and research and development expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.7 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $7.8 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the period ended December 31, 2013, partially offset by an increase in cash flows attributable to non-cash expenses of $2.0 million and an increase in cash flows attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.9 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of laboratory equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $1.1 million in cash used in investing activities was due to purchases of laboratory equipment and our facility build out.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $139.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $120.9 million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series A-2 and Series B preferred stock, net of issuance costs, in 2015, resulting in an increase in aggregate gross proceeds of $123.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and proceeds from an increase in borrowings under the equipment loan of $1.0 million. This increase was partially offset by payoff of the equipment loan of $2.1 million and the payment of deferred initial public offering costs of $1.7 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $18.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $15.5 million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of Series A-1 preferred stock, net of issuance costs, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $18.0 million during 2014.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we further advance our current research programs and our preclinical development activities; seek to identify product candidates and additional research programs; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we identify and develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, and distribution are not the responsibility of a collaborator. We do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize a product candidate. Furthermore, following the closing of our IPO, we have begun to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe expect that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, anticipated interest income, and anticipated research support under our collaboration agreement with Juno Therapeutics, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for the product candidates we may develop; \n \u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u00b7 the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of the product candidates we may develop; \n \u00b7 the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; \n \u00b7 the success of our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics; \n \u00b7 whether Juno Therapeutics exercises either or both of its options to extend the research program term under our collaboration (each of which would trigger an extension payment to us); \n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; \n \u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other medicines and technologies; and \n \u00b7 the costs of operating as a public company. \nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, any product candidate that we identify and develop, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of genomic medicines that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n (1) We sublease space at 300 Third Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires in September 2016. In addition, we sublease space at 675 W Kendall Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts under an operating lease that expires November 2016. \n (2) In February 2016, we entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which we intend to relocate to in the fall of 2016. Under the terms of the lease, we will lease approximately 59,783 square feet at $65.00 per square foot per year in base rent, which base rent is subject to scheduled annual increases, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and an additional rent of approximately $0.926 per square foot per year related to certain tenant improvements to the space. The contractual obligations for this lease are not reflected in the table above. The lease will continue until the end of the 84th full calendar month following the first day of the first full month immediately following the commencement of the lease. We have the option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term. \nThe table above does not include potential milestone fees, sublicense fees, royalty fees, licensing maintenance fees, and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs that we may be required to pay under agreements we have entered into with certain institutions to license intellectual property. We have not included such potential obligations in the table above because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty. For further information regarding these agreements and amounts that could become payable in the future under these agreements, please see Item 1. Business-License Agreements.\u201d Pursuant to our license agreement with Broad and Harvard, we have paid an aggregate of $9.4 million and $1.7 million, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for reimbursement of expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications licensed to us under such license agreement, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, any opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection (described in more detail in Item 1. Business-License Agreements - The Broad Institute and President and Fellows of Harvard College License Agreement\u201d). Given the interference and opposition proceedings involving the patents licensed to us under this license agreement are ongoing (described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d), we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for these expenses during future periods will increase substantially until such interference and opposition proceedings are resolved.\nOur agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial milestones. The maximum potential milestone payments under one of our licensing agreements are approximately $5.5 million. The maximum potential milestone payments under another of our licensing agreements are approximately $0.6 million in the aggregate per licensed product.\nUnder a license agreement with certain research institutions, we may also be obligated to pay clinical and regulatory milestones of up to $14.8 million per product approved in the United States, European Union, and Japan for the treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States, as well as potential commercial milestones of up to $54.0 million. In addition, we may be obligated to pay additional clinical and regulatory milestones of up to $4.1 million per product approved in the United States and at least one jurisdiction outside the Unites States for the treatment of human disease based on certain criteria, as well as potential\ncommercial milestones of up to $36.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the treatment of a rare disease meeting certain criteria.\nWe also may be obligated to pay royalties of low single digit to low double digits as a percentage of net product sales depending on the terms of the applicable agreement.\nUnder the terms of our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Juno Therapeutics. In addition, we will receive up to $22.0 million in research support over the next five years across the three programs under our collaboration, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and we are each obligated to use diligent efforts to perform all activities for which we are responsible under the collaboration.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations, or CROs, to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company,\u201d or EGC, may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC is permitted to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (1) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (2) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC.\nInternal Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we concluded that the material weakness that was previously disclosed in our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-208856), or the Registration Statement, had been remediated as of December 31, 2015. See Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Internal Controls and Procedures\u201d contained in the Registration Statement for disclosure of information about such material weakness. We determined that this material weakness had been remediated as of December 31, 2015 as a result of the corrective measures we described in the Registration Statement as having been completed.",

genome editing company focused on treating diseases by correcting disease-causing genes. They have a proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing platform and are targeting genetic illnesses where there are no treatments. \n- They have not generated any product revenue and have funded operations through equity financings, an upfront payment from their collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, and an equipment loan.\n- They incurred significant operating losses of $72.9M in 2015 and expect to continue incurring losses given the early stage of research programs.\n\nRevenue\n- Recognized $1.6M in collaboration revenue in 2015 from the Juno deal. No revenue prior to 2015.\n\nExpenses \n- R&D expenses increased to $18.8M in 2015 from $5.1M in 2014, primarily due to increased staffing, licensing fees triggered by the Juno deal, platform development costs, and facilities costs.  \n- G&A expenses increased to $18.1M in 2015 from $7.7M in 2014, largely due to patent-related legal fees and employee compensation costs.\n\nCash Flows\n- Used $5.4M in operating activities in 2015 compared to $8.7M in 2014, partly due to increased non-cash expenses and deferred revenue.\n- Provided $139.4M from financing activities in 2015, mostly from preferred stock issuances. \n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Had $143.2M in cash at December 31, 2015, not including $97.8M in net IPO proceeds received in Feb 2016.\n- Expect existing cash resources will fund at least 24 months of operations."}
