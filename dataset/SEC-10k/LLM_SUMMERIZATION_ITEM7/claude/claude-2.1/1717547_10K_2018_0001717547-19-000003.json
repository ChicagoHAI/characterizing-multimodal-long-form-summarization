Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes, Risk Factors,\u201d Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Business\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction\nWe are a CRE credit REIT focused on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net leased properties predominantly in the United States. CRE debt investments include senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. CRE debt securities primarily consist of CMBS (including B-pieces\u201d of a CMBS securitization pool) or CRE CLOs (collateralized by pools of CRE debt investments). Net leased properties consist of CRE properties with long-term leases to tenants on a net-lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance capital expenditures and real estate taxes.\nWe were organized in the state of Maryland on August 23, 2017. On September 15, 2017, Colony Capital, a publicly traded REIT listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CLNY,\u201d made an initial capital contribution of $1,000 to us. We intend to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. We conduct all of our activities and hold substantially all of our assets and liabilities through our operating subsidiary, Credit RE Operating Company, LLC (the OP\u201d). At December 31, 2018, we owned 97.6% of the OP, as its sole managing member. The remaining 2.4% is owned primarily by our affiliate as noncontrolling interests.\nWe are externally managed by a subsidiary of Colony Capital, a NYSE-listed global real estate and investment management firm with over $22 billion of total consolidated assets and over $43 billion of assets under management. As of December 31, 2018, Colony Capital owned approximately 37% of our common equity on a fully diluted basis, evidencing a strong alignment of interests between Colony Capital and our other stockholders.\nCombination\nOn January 31, 2018, the Combination among the CLNY Contributed Portfolio, NorthStar I, and NorthStar II was completed in an all-stock exchange.\nThe Combination created a prominent publicly traded CRE credit REIT. Our senior executives include Kevin P. Traenkle as the Chief Executive Officer and Neale W. Redington as the Chief Financial Officer. Our board of directors consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.\nRefer to Note 3, Business Combinations\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for further information related to the Combination.\nSignificant Developments\nDuring 2018 and through February 26, 2019, significant developments affecting our business and results of operations included the following:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed the Combination of the CLNY Contributed Portfolio, NorthStar I and NorthStar II on January 31, 2018 in an all-stock transaction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Publicly listed on the NYSE under the ticker CLNC\u201d on February 1, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Added to U.S. Small-cap Russell 2000 Index, effective June 25, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2018 gross capital allocation of over $2.0 billion through 37 new investments, including the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Originated 13 senior mortgage loans with a total commitment of $868.7 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Originated one mezzanine loan and one preferred equity investment with total commitments of $76.0 million as well as the upsize of an existing mezzanine loan investment by $43.1 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Acquired at par a preferred equity investment totaling $89.1 million and a mezzanine loan totaling $20.0 million from affiliates of our Manager;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Entered into two joint ventures with affiliates of our Manager to invest in two separate development projects in Dublin, Ireland for a total commitment of $231.7 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Purchased two net lease portfolios for a total of $618.9 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Purchased 14 CMBS investments with an aggregate face value of $72.6 million at a 19.2% discount;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Secured a $400.0 million corporate revolving credit facility with five relationship banks, and subsequently:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Upsized the revolving credit facility from $400.0 million to $525.0 million in December 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Completed an amendment that allows for the ability to borrow in foreign currencies, and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>On February 4, 2019, increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $35.0 million to $560.0 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased master repurchase facility by $1.0 billion from $1.1 billion to $2.1 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recorded $113.9 million of provision for loan losses on eleven loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recorded impairments of operating real estate of $31.8 million, $29.4 million of which resulted from reductions in the estimated holding periods, rent reductions, tenant vacancies of properties;

Our net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of purchase discounts, varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment rates on our CRE loans, prepayment speeds and the ability of our borrowers to make scheduled interest payments. Interest rates and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, credit-worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results also may be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by us or that are included in our CMBS. Our net property operating income depends on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of our real estate equity investments, lease currently available space and continue to attract new tenants.\nChanges in fair value of our assets\nIt is our business strategy to hold our target assets as long-term investments. As a result, we do not expect that changes in the market value of the assets will normally impact our operating results. However, at least on a quarterly basis, we assess both our ability and intent to continue to hold such assets as long-term investments. As part of this process, we monitor our target assets for other-than-temporary\u201d impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our assets could result in our recognizing an impairment charge or realizing losses upon the sale of such securities.\nChanges in market interest rates\nWith respect to our proposed business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the value of fixed-rate investments to decrease;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and CMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to increase.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the value of the fixed-rate assets in our portfolio to increase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and CMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Credit risk\nOne objective of our strategy is to minimize credit losses. However, we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target assets. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses and by deploying a comprehensive review and asset selection process and by careful ongoing\nmonitoring of acquired assets. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nSize of investment portfolio\nThe size of our portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of our commercial mortgage loans, other commercial real estate-related debt investments and the other assets we own, is also a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we earn increases. However, a larger portfolio may result in increased expenses to the extent that we incur additional interest expense to finance our assets.\nMarket conditions\nWe believe that market conditions impact our operating results and will cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and risk profiles of our business change. In addition, changes in government programs could impact our ability to acquire our target assets. Except as set forth above, we are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and real estate, generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition of real estate-related assets, other than those referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of the Combination, comparisons of our period to period financial information as set forth herein may not be meaningful. The historical financial information included herein as of any date, or for any periods, on or prior to January 31, 2018, represents the pre-merger financial information of the CLNY Investment Entities, our accounting predecessor, on a stand-alone basis. The CLNY Investment Entities represent only a portion of our business following the Combination and therefore do not represent the results of operations we would have had for any period prior to the Combination. As of February 1, 2018, our results of operations reflect our operation following the Combination of our accounting predecessor, the CLNY Investment Entities, and NorthStar I and NorthStar II. The results of operations of NorthStar I and NorthStar II are incorporated into ours effective from February 1, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for years ended December

increased by $11.4 million to $151.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase of $80.4 million related to the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II loans, preferred equity, and CMBS and an increase of $26.4 million related to originations and acquisitions in 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $83.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities and the repayment of loan investments, as well as a decrease of $11.5 million due to placing the four NY hospitality loans on non-accrual status.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $26.1 million to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $28.1 million increase as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II, a $7.6 million increase related to borrowings on our master repurchase and CMBS credit facilities in 2018, and a $5.5 million increase related to the revolving credit facility entered into on February 1, 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $16.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities and the repayment of securitization bonds payable.\nInterest income on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nInterest income on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to our investment in the subordinate tranches of the consolidated securitization trusts acquired as a result of the Combination.\nProperty and other income\nProperty operating income\nProperty operating income increased by $154.6 million to $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $120.7 million, two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $18.0 million and the two real estate properties acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $14.9 million.\nExpenses\nManagement fee expense\nManagement fee expense represents fees paid to our Manager in accordance with the Management Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management fee expense was $43.2 million. We entered into the Management Agreement on January 31, 2018 and therefore did not incur any management fee expenses prior to this date.\nProperty operating expense\nProperty operating expense increased by $65.6 million to $73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $49.4 million and the two real estate properties acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $11.7 million.\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense represents costs such as professional fees associated with new investments and transactions. Transaction, investment and servicing expense increased by $34.2 million to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $31.9 million of transaction costs associated with the Combination.\nInterest expense on real estate\nInterest expense on real estate increased by $38.3 million to $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $30.7 million and the two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $7.4 million.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $81.8 million to $91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $72.4 million, the two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $8.2 million and the two hotels acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $2.2 million.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses increased by $113.4 million to $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to provisions for loan losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 on our four NY hospitality loans of $53.8 million, four loans collateralized with 28 office, retail, multifamily and industrial properties of $36.8 million, two loans collateralized by retail properties of $15.0 million and one loan collateralized by a retail property of $8.8 million. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Loans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment, net\u201d for further detail.\nImpairment of operating real estate\nImpairment of operating real estate of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to certain retail and student housing properties in our operating real estate portfolio, as well as the multi-tenant office portfolio sold in October 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, Real Estate, net\u201d and Note 15, Fair Value\u201d for further detail.\nAdministrative expense\nAdministrative expense increased by $14.0 million to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to additional reimbursable expenses allocated to us by our Manager as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II in the Combination. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, Related Party Arrangements,\u201d for further information on reimbursement of expenses.\nOther income (loss)\nUnrealized gain on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an unrealized gain on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $5.0 million which represents the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities of the securitization trusts consolidated as a result of our investment in the subordinate tranches of these securitization trusts acquired in the Combination.\nRealized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a realized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $3.4 million which represents a loss incurred from lower than expected future cash flows on a subordinate tranche of a securitization trust.\nOther loss, net\nOther loss, net increased by $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an unrealized loss on non-designated interest rate contracts of $6.0 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain on non-designated foreign exchange contracts of $2.8 million.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures decreased by $0.9 million to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a net loss of $33.5 million related to our PE Investments. This is partially offset by an increase of $20.3 million related to equity method investments acquired as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II, an increase of $8.1 million related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures originated in 2018 and an increase of $5.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $34.9 million to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a tax valuation adjustment recorded in 2018 following an analysis that determined it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset related to its PE Investments will not be realized. This conclusion was reached following the gross $55.2 million unrealized loss recorded during the year on PE Investments, in addition to future income projections. We are currently exploring the potential disposition of our PE Investments.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income\nInterest income decreased by $0.3 million to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income from the loan portfolio existing prior to the tri-party merger among Colony Capital, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance ( NRF\u201d), which closed on January 10, 2017 (the CLNY Merger\u201d) decreased $15.2 million primarily due to loan sales and repayments, which more than offset the $14.6 million of incremental interest income from $177.2 million of loans receivable acquired from NRF through the CLNY Merger and additional interest income from draws on development loans in 2017.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased by $5.0 million to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the payoff of warehouse facilities in 2017 with proceeds from sales of loan and paydown of securitization bonds through resolutions of underlying loans, partially offset by interest expense incurred on a secured financing transaction in 2017.\nProperty and other income\nProperty operating income, property operating expense and depreciation and amortization\nThese amounts increased significantly in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of Colony Capital's acquisition of 13 net lease properties from NRF through the CLNY Merger totaling $205.4 million. Prior to the CLNY Merger, the CLNY Investment Entities did not hold any real estate except for two properties comprised of two medical office buildings acquired through foreclosure in October 2015 and sold in March 2017 and a hotel acquired through foreclosure in January 2017.\nOther income\nOther income increased by $0.3 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher recovery of expenses from borrowers and other recoveries from resolution of our loan investments.\nExpenses\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense represents costs such as professional fees associated with new investments and transactions. Transaction, investment and servicing expense increased by $0.8 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased legal costs incurred in connection with the sales of loans in 2017.\nInterest expense on real estate\nInterest expense on real estate was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the CLNY Merger as compared, to the year ended December 31, 2016, when we did not hold any mortgage notes.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses decreased by $2.9 million to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Provision for loan loss in 2017 was attributed to a mortgage loan that went into maturity default in November 2017, while the provision for loan loss in 2016 was attributed to a decrease in collateral value of a mortgage loan secured by a hotel which was subsequently foreclosed in January 2017.\nAdministrative expense\nAdministrative expense decreased by $2.8 million to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to the Combination, administrative expenses primarily consisted of corporate-level costs that are either incurred specifically on behalf of the CLNY Investment Entities or an allocation of costs estimated to be applicable to the CLNY Investment Entities, largely based on the relative assets under management of the CLNY Investment Entities to the total assets under management of Colony Capital. The allocated administrative cost was $12.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017, as compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects a combination of a lower percentage of costs allocated to the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the CLNY Merger which increased Colony Capital's total assets under management and synergies from the CLNY Merger which resulted in overall cost savings to Colony Capital.\nOther income (loss)\nOther loss, net\nOther loss, net increased by $0.3 million to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to an unrealized loss on non-designated interest rate contracts.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures increased by $8.6 million to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $7.2 million increase in 2017 driven by additional draws and sales of land under development by one of the equity method investees and a $1.4 million increase due to net earnings from two private real estate funds acquired through the CLNY Merger.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $0.7 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from investments in private real estate funds acquired in the CLNY Merger.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures\nCore Earnings\nWe present Core Earnings, which is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure of our performance. We believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This supplemental financial measure helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and U.S GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current portfolio and operations. We also use Core Earnings to determine the incentive fees we pay to our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 11, Related Party Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In addition, we believe that our investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of us and our peers, and as such, we believe that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to our investors.\nWe define Core Earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders (or, without duplication, the owners of the common equity of our direct subsidiaries, such as our OP) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the expenses incurred in connection with our formation, (iii) the incentive fee, (iv) acquisition costs from successful acquisitions, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the current quarter, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, (vii) one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and (viii) certain material non-cash income or expense items that in the judgment of management should not be included in Core Earnings. For clauses (vii) and (viii), such exclusions shall only be applied after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. Core Earnings reflects adjustments to U.S. GAAP net income to exclude impairment of real estate and provision for loan losses. Such impairment and losses may ultimately be realized, in part or full, upon a sale or monetization of the related investments and such realized losses would be reflected in Core Earnings.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net income or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar non-GAAP supplemental financial measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders to Core Earnings attributable to our common stockholders and noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership (dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(168,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized loss:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of operating real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unrealized loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization and impairment previously adjusted for Core Earnings (loss) on real estate sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments related to noncontrolling interests in investment entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings attributable to Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. common stockholders and noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings per share(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of common shares and OP units(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We calculate core earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, based on a weighted-average number of common shares and OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries).

Following January 31, 2018, we assume approximately 131.0 million of shares of Class A common stock, Class B-3 common stock and OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries) were outstanding. This results in a weighted average share count for the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately 123.8 million shares.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary liquidity needs include commitments to repay borrowings, finance our assets and operations, meet future funding obligations, make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase our shares and fund other general business needs. We use significant cash to make additional investments, repay the principal of and interest on our borrowings and pay other financing costs, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations, which includes making payments to our Manager in accordance with the management agreement.\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities and cash generated from asset sales and investment maturities. However, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our Investment Company Act exclusion, we may use a number of sources to finance our business, including bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), master repurchase facilities and securitizations, as described below. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, we have access to liquidity through public offerings of debt and equity securities. We also expect to invest in a number of our assets through co-investments with other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of our Manager and/or other third parties, which may allow us to pool capital to access larger transactions and diversify investment exposure.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe have a multi-pronged financing strategy that includes an up to $560 million secured revolving credit facility, up to approximately $2.1 billion in secured revolving repurchase facilities, non-recourse securitization financing, commercial mortgages and other asset-level financing structures. In addition, we may use other forms of financing, including additional warehouse facilities, public and private secured and unsecured debt issuances and equity or equity-related securities issuances by us or our subsidiaries. We may also finance a portion of our investments through the syndication of one or more interests in a whole loan or securitization. We will seek to match the nature and duration of the financing with the underlying asset's cash flow, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate.\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio\nThe following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio:\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents (i) total outstanding secured debt less cash to (ii) total equity, in each case, at period end.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following table presents our total sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Table 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sources of Corporate Liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Bank credit facility availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total sources of corporate liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPotential Sources of Liquidity\nBank Credit Facilities\nWe use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our business. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates.\nOn February 1, 2018, the OP (together with certain subsidiaries of the OP from time to time party thereto as borrowers, collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the Bank Credit Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the several lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to provide a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million. On December 17, 2018, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments was increased to $525.0 million. On February 4, 2019, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments was increased to $560.0 million.\nAdvances under the Bank Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the applicable Borrower's election, either a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.25%, or a base rate determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin of 1.25%. An unused commitment fee at a rate of 0.25% or 0.35%, per annum, depending on the amount of facility utilization, applies to un-utilized borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Facility. Amounts owing under the Bank Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings with respect to which a LIBOR rate election is in effect.\nThe maximum amount available for borrowing at any time under the Bank Credit Facility is limited to a borrowing base valuation of certain investment assets, with the valuation of such investment assets generally determined according to a percentage of adjusted net book value. As of the date hereof, the borrowing base valuation is sufficient to support the outstanding borrowings. The Bank Credit Facility will mature on February 1, 2022, unless the OP elects to exercise the extension options for up to two (2) additional terms of six (6) months each, subject to the terms and conditions in the Bank Credit Facility, resulting in a latest maturity date of February 1, 2023.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Bank Credit Facility are guaranteed by substantially all material wholly owned subsidiaries of the OP pursuant to a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement with the OP and certain subsidiaries of the OP in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d) and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a pledge of substantially all equity interests owned by the Borrowers and the guarantors, as well as by a security interest in deposit accounts of the Borrowers and the Guarantors (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) in which the proceeds of investment asset distributions are maintained.\nThe Bank Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, the obligation of the Company to maintain REIT status and be listed on the NYSE, and limitations on debt, liens and restricted payments. In addition, the Bank Credit Facility includes the following financial covenants applicable to the OP and its consolidated subsidiaries: (a) consolidated tangible net worth of the OP must be greater than or equal to the sum of (i) $2.105 billion and (ii) 50% of the proceeds received by the OP from any offering of its common equity and of the proceeds from any offering by the Company of its common equity to the extent such proceeds are contributed to the OP, excluding any such proceeds that are contributed to the OP within ninety (90) days of receipt and applied to acquire capital stock of the OP; (b) the OP's earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, and amortization plus lease expenses to fixed charges for any period of four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters must be not less than 1.50 to 1.00; (c) the OP's interest coverage ratio must be not less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (d) the OP's ratio of\nconsolidated total debt to consolidated total assets must be not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The Bank Credit Facility also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants or representations, cross default to material indebtedness or material judgment defaults, bankruptcy matters involving any Borrower or any Guarantor and certain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default will limit the ability of the OP and its subsidiaries to make distributions and may result in the termination of the credit facility, acceleration of repayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to the collateral.\nMaster Repurchase Facilities and CMBS Credit Facilities\nCurrently, our primary source of financing is our master repurchase facilities, which we use to finance the origination of senior loans, and CMBS credit facilities, which we use to finance the purchase of securities. Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans, participations and securities that we own in an amount generally equal to (i) the market value of such loans, participations and/or securities multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we sell our loans, participations and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans, participations and securities and pay interest to the lender under the master repurchase agreement. We intend to maintain formal relationships with multiple counterparties to obtain master repurchase financing on favorable terms.\nThe following table presents a summary of our master repurchase facilities as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum Facility Size\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Final Maturity (Years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Interest Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Master Repurchase Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Master Repurchase Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>880,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMBS Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CMBS Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> LIBOR + 2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,765,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,365,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The maturity dates on CMBS Credit Facilities are dependent upon asset type and will typically range from one to two months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Securitizations\nWe may seek to utilize non-recourse long-term securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans, especially loan originations, to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our REIT qualification and exclusion from the Investment Company Act in order to generate cash for funding new investments. This would involve conveying a pool of assets to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which would issue one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes would be secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we would receive the cash proceeds on the sale of non-recourse notes and a 100% interest in the equity of the issuing entity. The securitization of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because any equity interest we retain in the issuing entity would be subordinate to the notes issued to investors and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a securitized pool of assets before the owners of the notes experience any losses.\nOther potential sources of financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including secured and unsecured forms of borrowing and selective wind-down and dispositions of assets. We may also seek to raise equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(467,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>487,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(551,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(319,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash inflows from operating activities are generated primarily through interest received from loans receivable and securities, property operating income from our real estate portfolio, and distributions of earnings received from unconsolidated ventures. This is partially offset by payment of interest expenses for credit facilities and mortgage payable, and operating expenses supporting our various lines of business, including property management and operations, loan servicing and workout of loans in default, investment transaction costs, as well as general administrative costs.\nOur operating activities generated cash flows of $100.7 million, $107.0 million and $88.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of transaction costs paid in connection with the Combination offset by additional cash inflows related to the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of additional cash inflows generated by properties acquired in the CLNY Merger.\nWe believe cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities include cash outlays for acquisition of real estate, disbursements on new and/or existing loans, and contributions to unconsolidated ventures, which are partially offset by repayments and sales of loan receivables, distributions of capital received from unconsolidated ventures, proceeds from sale of real estate, as well as proceeds from maturity or sale of securities.\nInvesting activities in 2018 used net cash outflow of $467.7 million, resulting from acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $919.5 million, acquisition of and additions to real estate, related intangibles and leasing commissions of $415.1 million, investment in unconsolidated ventures of $239.7 million, acquisition of real estate securities, available for sale of $58.7 million, and deposit on investments of $29.4 million, partially offset by repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $626.6 million, cash received in the Combination of $328.5 million, proceeds from sale of real estate of $167.9 million, and distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated ventures of $98.5 million.\nInvesting activities in 2017 generated net cash inflow of $439.3 million, resulting from repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $537.5 million, distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated ventures of $55.1 million, cash received in excess of accretion on purchased credit impaired loans of $52.4 million, proceeds from sale of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $17.5 million and proceeds from sale of real estate of $8.9 million, partially offset by acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $200.2 million and investment in unconsolidated ventures of $16.3 million.\nInvesting activities in 2016 generated net cash inflow of $199.4 million, resulting from repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $357.0 million, proceeds from sale of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $141.5 million and cash received in excess of accretion on purchased credit impaired loans of $18.1 million, partially offset by acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $257.6 million and investment in unconsolidated ventures of $21.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe finance our investing activities largely through borrowings secured by our investments along with capital from third party or affiliated coinvestors. We also have the ability to raise capital in the public markets through issuances of common stock, as well as draw upon our corporate credit facility, to finance our investing and operating activities. Accordingly, we incur cash outlays for payments on third party debt, dividends to our common stockholders as well as distributions to our noncontrolling interests.\nFinancing activities in 2018 generated net cash inflow of $487.5 million, resulting from borrowings from credit facilities in the amount of $1.7 billion and borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $246.4 million, partially offset by repayment of credit facilities in the amount of $999.3 million, distributions paid on common stock in the amount of $189.8 million, repayment of securitization bonds in the amount of $108.2 million, and repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $141.8 million.\nFinancing activities in 2017 used net cash outflow of $551.7 million, resulting from repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $342.9 million, distributions paid to CLNY owners in the amount of $299.3 million and distribution paid to noncontrolling interest in the amount of $113.0 million, partially offset by contributions from CLNY owners in the amount of $81.5 million, borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $72.2 million and contributions from noncontrolling interest in the amount of $50.5 million.\nFinancing activities in 2016 used net cash outflow of $319.7 million, resulting from repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $407.3 million, distributions paid to CLNY owners in the amount of $122.1 million and distribution paid to noncontrolling interest in the amount of $77.8 million, partially offset by contributions from CLNY owners in the amount of $113.0 million, contributions from noncontrolling interest in the amount of $95.6 million and borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $81.1 million.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies of the Company\nThe following table sets forth the known contractual obligations of the Company on an undiscounted basis.

We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nUnderwriting, Asset and Risk Management\nOur Manager closely monitors our portfolio and actively manages risks associated with, among other things, our assets and interest rates. Prior to investing in any particular asset, our Manager's underwriting team, in conjunction with third party providers, undertakes a rigorous asset-level due diligence process, involving intensive data collection and analysis, to ensure that we\nunderstand fully the state of the market and the risk-reward profile of the asset. Prior to making a final investment decision, our Manager focuses on portfolio diversification to determine whether a target asset will cause our portfolio to be too heavily concentrated with, or cause too much risk exposure to, any one borrower, real estate sector, geographic region, source of cash flow for payment or other geopolitical issues. If our Manager determines that a proposed acquisition presents excessive concentration risk, it may determine not to acquire an otherwise attractive asset.\nFor each asset that we acquire, our Manager's asset management team engages in active management of the asset, the intensity of which depends on the attendant risks. The asset manager works collaboratively with the underwriting team to formulate a strategic plan for the particular asset, which includes evaluating the underlying collateral and updating valuation assumptions to reflect changes in the real estate market and the general economy. This plan also generally outlines several strategies for the asset to extract the maximum amount of value from each asset under a variety of market conditions. Such strategies may vary depending on the type of asset, the availability of refinancing options, recourse and maturity, but may include, among others, the restructuring of non-performing or sub-performing loans, the negotiation of discounted pay-offs or other modification of the terms governing a loan, and the foreclosure and management of assets underlying non-performing loans in order to reposition them for profitable disposition. Our Manager and its affiliates will continuously track the progress of an asset against the original business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to own the asset do not outweigh the associated rewards. Under these circumstances, certain assets will require intensified asset management in order to achieve optimal value realization.\nOur Manager's asset management team engages in a proactive and comprehensive on-going review of the credit quality of each asset it manages. In particular for debt investments, on at least an annual basis, the asset management team will evaluate the financial wherewithal of individual borrowers to meet contractual obligations as well as review the financial stability of the assets securing such debt investments. Further, there is ongoing review of borrower covenant compliance including the ability of borrowers to meet certain negotiated debt service coverage ratios and debt yield tests. For equity investments, the asset management team, with the assistance of third party property managers, monitors and reviews key metrics such as occupancy, same store sales, tenant payment rates, property budgets and capital expenditures. If through this analysis of credit quality, the asset management team encounters declines in credit not in accord with the original business plan, the team evaluates the risks and determine what changes, if any, are required to the business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to hold the investment do not outweigh the associated rewards.\nIn addition, the audit committee of our board of directors, in consultation with management, periodically reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including key risks to which we are subject, including credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases at our multifamily and student housing properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our multifamily and student housing properties.\nRefer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nCertain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nWe consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest by first considering if an entity meets the definition of a VIE for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, or if we have the power to control an entity through a majority of voting interest or through other arrangements.\nVariable Interest Entities-A VIE is an entity that either (i) lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; (ii) whose equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest; or (iii) is established with non-substantive voting rights. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE through (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. We also consider interests held by our related parties, including de facto agents. We assess whether we are members of a related party group that collectively meets the power and benefits criteria and, if so, whether we are most closely associated with the VIE. In performing the related party analysis, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: the amount and characteristics of their investment relative to the related party; our ability and the related party's ability to control or significantly influence key decisions of the VIE including consideration of involvement by de facto agents; the obligation or likelihood for us or the related party to fund operating losses of the VIE; and the similarity and significance of the VIE's business to our activities and to those of the related party. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE, and whether we are the primary beneficiary, may involve significant judgment, including the determination of which activities most significantly affect the entities' performance, and estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of assets held by the VIE.\nVoting Interest Entities-Unlike VIEs, voting interest entities have sufficient equity to finance their activities and equity investors exhibit the characteristics of a controlling financial interest through their voting rights. We consolidate such entities when we have the power to control these entities through ownership of a majority of the entities' voting interests or through other arrangements.\nAt each reporting period, we reassess whether changes in facts and circumstances cause a change in the status of an entity as a VIE or voting interest entity, and/or a change in our consolidation assessment. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively. An entity may be consolidated as a result of this reassessment, in which case, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest in the entity are recorded at fair value upon initial consolidation. Any existing equity interest we hold in the entity prior to us obtaining control will be remeasured at fair value, which may result in a gain or loss recognized upon initial consolidation. However, if the consolidation represents an asset acquisition of a voting interest entity, our existing interest in the acquired assets, if any, is not remeasured to fair value but continues to be carried at historical cost. We may also deconsolidate a subsidiary as a result of this reassessment, which may result in a gain or loss recognized upon deconsolidation depending on the carrying values of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of any interests retained.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is based on an exit price, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to estimated fair values are made to appropriately reflect counterparty credit risk as well as our own credit-worthiness.\nThe estimated fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are categorized into a three-tier hierarchy, prioritized based on the level of transparency in inputs used in the valuation techniques, as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in non-active markets, or valuation techniques utilizing inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable data directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3-At least one assumption or input is unobservable and it is significant to the fair value measurement, requiring significant management judgment or estimate.\nWhere the inputs used to measure the fair value of a financial instrument fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the financial instrument is categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe evaluate each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business. If substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. If not, for an acquisition to be considered a business, it would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e., there is a continuation of revenue before and after the transaction). A substantive process is not ancillary or minor, cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay or is otherwise considered unique or scarce. To qualify as a business without outputs, the acquired assets would require an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to perform a substantive process.\nNet cash paid to acquire a business or assets is classified as investing activities on the accompanying statements of cash flows.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity, net of fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require significant estimates and assumptions.\nFor acquisitions that are not deemed to be businesses, the assets acquired are recognized based on their cost to us as the acquirer, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the carrying amount of the assets acquired. The cost of assets acquired in a group is allocated to individual assets within the group based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill. Transaction costs related to acquisition of assets are included in the cost basis of the assets acquired.\nThe acquisitions of NorthStar I and NorthStar II were each accounted for under the acquisition method for a business combination. See Note 3, Business Combinations\u201d, to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nLoans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment\nWe originate and purchase loans and preferred equity held for investment. The accounting framework for loans receivable depends on our strategy whether to hold or sell the loan, whether the loan was credit-impaired at the time of acquisition, or whether the lending arrangement is an Acquisition, Development and Construction ( ADC\u201d) loan.\nLoans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment\nLoans and preferred equity that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment. Originated loans and preferred equity are recorded at amortized cost, or outstanding unpaid principal balance plus exit fees less net deferred loan fees. Net deferred loan fees include unamortized origination and other fees charged to the borrower less direct incremental loan origination costs incurred by us. Purchased loans are recorded at amortized cost, or unpaid principal balance plus purchase premium or less unamortized discount. Costs to purchase loans and preferred equity are expensed as incurred.\nInterest Income-Interest income is recognized based upon contractual interest rate and unpaid principal balance of the loans. Net deferred loan fees on originated loans are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest income over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method. Premium or discount on purchased loans are amortized as adjustments to interest income over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method. For revolving loans, net deferred loan fees, premium or discount are amortized to interest income using the straight-line method. When a loan is prepaid, prepayment fees and any excess of proceeds over the carrying amount of the loan are recognized as additional interest income.\nNonaccrual-Accrual of interest income is suspended on nonaccrual loans and preferred equity investments. Loans and preferred equity that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, are generally considered nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual. Interest receivable is reversed against interest income when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collected is recognized on a cash basis by crediting income when received; or if ultimate collectability of loan and preferred equity principal is uncertain, interest collected is recognized using a cost recovery method by applying interest collected as a reduction to loan and preferred equity carrying value. Loans and preferred equity investments may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest are current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest are reasonably assured.\nImpairment and Allowance for Loan Losses-On a periodic basis, we analyze the extent and effect of any credit migration from underwriting and the initial investment review associated with the performance of a loan and preferred equity investment and/or value of its underlying collateral, financial and operating capability of the borrower or sponsor, as well as amount and status of any senior loan, where applicable. Specifically, operating results of collateral properties and any cash reserves are analyzed and\nused to assess whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover debt service requirements currently and into the future, ability of the borrower to refinance the loan or preferred equity investment, liquidation value of collateral properties, and financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors, as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the collateral properties. Such analysis is performed at least quarterly, or more often as needed when impairment indicators are present. During the year of 2018, we recorded a $113.9 million provision for loan loss. See Note 4, Loans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment, net\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nLoans and preferred equity investments are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with contractual terms of the loans and preferred equity investments, including consideration of underlying collateral value. Allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in loans and preferred equity held for investment at balance sheet date. Changes in allowance for loan and preferred equity losses are recorded in the provision for loan losses on the statement of operations. Allowance for loan losses generally exclude interest receivable as accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan or preferred equity investment is placed on nonaccrual status. Allowance for loan losses is generally measured as the difference between the carrying value of the loan or preferred equity investment and either the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan or preferred equity investment or an observable market price for the loan or preferred equity investment. Subsequent changes in impairment are recorded as adjustments to the provision for loan losses. Loans and preferred equity investments are charged off against allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. A loan or preferred equity investment is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan or preferred equity investment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and preferred equity investments are written down to the fair value of the collateral less disposal cost, first through a charge-off against allowance for loan losses, if any, then recorded as impairment loss.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring-A loan with contractual terms modified in a manner that grants concession to the borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a TDR. Concessions could include term extensions, payment deferrals, interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance, or other actions designed to maximize our collection on the loan. As a TDR is generally considered to be an impaired loan, it is measured for impairment based on our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans that we intend to sell or liquidate in the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value less disposal cost, with valuation changes recognized as impairment loss. Loans held for sale are not subject to allowance for loan losses. Net deferred loan origination fees and loan purchase premiums or discounts are deferred and capitalized as part of the carrying value of the held for sale loan until the loan is sold and are therefore included in the periodic valuation adjustments based on lower of cost or fair value less disposal cost.\nADC Arrangements\nWe provide loans to third party developers for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under an ADC arrangement, we participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or other use of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each ADC arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. ADC arrangements with characteristics implying loan classification are presented as loans held for investment and result in the recognition of interest income. ADC arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are presented as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and are accounted for using the equity method. The classification of each ADC arrangement as either loan receivable or real estate joint venture involves significant judgment and relies on various factors, including market conditions, amount and timing of expected residual profits, credit enhancements in the form of guaranties, estimated fair value of the collateral, and significance of borrower equity in the project, among others. The classification of ADC arrangements is performed at inception, and periodically reassessed when significant changes occur in the circumstances or conditions described above.\nOperating real estate\nReal estate acquisitions-Real estate acquired in acquisitions that are deemed to be business combinations is recorded at the fair values of the acquired components at the time of acquisition, allocated among land, buildings, improvements, equipment and lease-related tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including foregone leasing costs, in-place lease values and above-or below-market lease values. Real estate acquired in acquisitions that are deemed to be asset acquisitions is recorded at the total value of consideration transferred, including transaction costs, allocated to the acquired components based upon relative fair value. The estimated fair value of acquired land is derived from recent comparable sales of land and listings within the same local region based on available market data. The estimated fair value of acquired buildings and building improvements is derived from comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis using market-based assumptions, or replacement cost, as appropriate. The fair value of site and tenant improvements is estimated based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nReal estate held for investment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nCosts Capitalized or Expensed-Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while expenditures for significant renovations that improve or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation-Real estate held for investment, other than land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Term\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building (fee interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19 to 48 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building leasehold interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lesser of remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lesser of the useful life or remaining life of the building\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6 to 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lesser of the useful life or remaining term of the lease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 to 8 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nImpairment-We evaluate our real estate held for investment for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate real estate for impairment generally on an individual property basis. If an impairment indicator exists, we evaluate the undiscounted future net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the property, including any estimated proceeds from the eventual disposition of the property. If multiple outcomes are under consideration, we may apply a probability-weighted approach to the impairment analysis. Based upon the analysis, if the carrying value of a property exceeds its undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property. In evaluating and/or measuring impairment, we consider, among other things, current and estimated future cash flows associated with each property, market information for each sub-market, including, where applicable, competition levels, foreclosure levels, leasing trends, occupancy trends, lease or room rates, and the market prices of similar properties recently sold or currently being offered for sale, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. Another key consideration in this assessment is our assumption about the highest and best use of our real estate investments and our intent and ability to hold them for a reasonable period that would allow for the recovery of their carrying values. If such assumptions change and we shorten its expected hold period, this may result in the recognition of impairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $31.8 million impairment loss on our operating real estate portfolio. See Note 7, Real Estate, net\u201d and Note 15, Fair Value,\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nReal estate held for sale\nClassification as held for sale-Real estate is classified as held for sale in the period when (i) management approves a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms, (iii) a program is initiated to locate a buyer and actively market the asset for sale at a reasonable price, and (iv) completion of the sale is probable within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal cost, with any write-down to fair value less disposal cost recorded as an impairment loss. For any increase in fair value less disposal cost subsequent to classification as held for sale, the impairment loss may be reversed, but only up to the amount of cumulative loss previously recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell the real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been continuously classified as held for investment, and (ii) its estimated fair value at the time we decide not to sell.\nReal estate sales-We evaluate if real estate sale transactions qualify for recognition under the full accrual method, considering whether, among other criteria, the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay, any receivable due to us is not subject to future subordination, we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold real estate. At the time the sale is consummated, a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between the sale price less disposal cost and the carrying value of the real estate.\nForeclosed properties\nWe receive foreclosed properties in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. Foreclosed properties are recognized, generally, at the time the real estate is received at foreclosure sale or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties are initially measured at fair value. Deficiencies compared to the carrying value of the loan, after reversing any previously recognized loss provision on the loan, are recorded as impairment loss. We periodically evaluate foreclosed properties for subsequent decrease in fair value, which is recorded as additional impairment loss. Fair value of foreclosed properties is generally based on third party appraisals, broker price opinions, comparable sales or a combination thereof.\nReal Estate Securities\nWe classify our CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. However, we have elected the fair value option for the assets and liabilities of our investments in securitization financing entities ( Investing VIEs\u201d), and as a result, any unrealized gains (losses) on the consolidated Investing VIEs are recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, we held subordinate tranches of three securitization trusts, which represent our retained interest in the securitization trusts, which we consolidate under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 6, Real Estate Securities, Available for Sale\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nInterest Income-Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security. Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income.\nImpairment-CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) as any change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trust, net as losses occur.\nCRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly. Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses. The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow. The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any OTTI recorded on our CRE securities.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using one of (i) equity method where applicable; (ii) fair value option if elected; (iii) fair value through earnings if fair value is readily determinable, including election of NAV practical expedient where applicable; or (iv) for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the measurement alternative to measure at cost adjusted for any impairment and observable price changes, as applicable.\nFair value changes of equity method investments under the fair value option are recorded in earnings from investments in unconsolidated ventures. Fair value changes of other equity investments, including adjustments for observable price changes under the measurement alternative, are recorded in other gain (loss).\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments under the equity method of accounting if they have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an entity, but do not have a controlling financial interest. The equity method investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for capital contributions, distributions and our share of the entity's net income or loss as well as other comprehensive income or loss. Our share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in an entity if the governing documents prescribe a substantive non-proportionate earnings allocation formula or a preferred return to certain investors. For certain equity method investments, we record our proportionate share of income on a one to three month lag. Distributions of operating profits from equity method investments are reported as operating activities, while distributions in excess of operating profits while distributions in excess of operating profits are reported as investing activities in the statement of cash flows under the cumulative earnings approach.\nAt December 31, 2018, our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of investments in PE Investments, senior loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity held in joint ventures, as well as ADC loan arrangements accounted for as equity method investments. At December 31, 2017, our investments in unconsolidated ventures consisted of investments in PE Investments and ADC loan arrangements accounted for as equity method investments.\nImpairment\nEvaluation of impairment applies to equity method investments and equity investments under the measurement alternative. If indicators of impairment exist, we will first estimate the fair value of its investment. In assessing fair value, we generally consider, among others, the estimated enterprise value of the investee or fair value of the investee's underlying net assets, including net cash flows to be generated by the investee as applicable.\nFor investments under the measurement alternative, if carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, an impairment is deemed to have occurred.\nFor equity method investments, further consideration is made if a decrease in value of the investment is other-than-temporary to determine if impairment loss should be recognized. Assessment of other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") involves management judgment, including, but not limited to, consideration of the investee's financial condition, operating results, business prospects and creditworthiness, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery of its carrying value, or a significant and prolonged decline in traded price of the investee's equity security. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that we may not fully recover the carrying value of its investment, then the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.\nInvestments that are other-than-temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value. Impairment loss is recorded in earnings from investments in unconsolidated ventures for equity method investments and in other gain (loss) for investments under the measurement alternative.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nSale accounting for transfers of financial assets is limited to the transfer of an entire financial asset, a group of financial assets in their entirety, or a component of a financial asset that meets the definition of a participating interest by having characteristics that are similar to the original financial asset.\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. If we have any continuing involvement, rights or obligations with the transferred financial asset (outside of standard representations and warranties), sale accounting would require that the transfer meets the following conditions: (1) the transferred asset has been legally isolated; (2) the transferee has the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred asset; and (3) we do not maintain effective control over the transferred asset through an agreement that provides for (a) both an entitlement and an obligation by us to repurchase or redeem the asset before its maturity, (b) our unilateral ability to reclaim the asset and a more than trivial benefit attributable to that ability, or (c) the transferee requiring us to repurchase the asset at a price so favorable to the transferee that it is probable the repurchase will occur.\nIf the criteria for sale accounting are met, the transferred financial asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized upon sale, taking into account any retained interests. Transfers of financial assets that do not meet the criteria for sale are accounted for as financing transactions.\nRecent Accounting Updates\nRecent accounting updates are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Annual Report Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes, Risk Factors,\u201d Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Business\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction\nWe are a CRE credit REIT focused on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net leased properties predominantly in the United States. CRE debt investments include senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. CRE debt securities primarily consist of CMBS (including B-pieces\u201d of a CMBS securitization pool) or CRE CLOs (collateralized by pools of CRE debt investments). Net leased properties consist of CRE properties with long-term leases to tenants on a net-lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance capital expenditures and real estate taxes.\nWe were organized in the state of Maryland on August 23, 2017. On September 15, 2017, Colony Capital, a publicly traded REIT listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CLNY,\u201d made an initial capital contribution of $1,000 to us. We intend to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. We conduct all of our activities and hold substantially all of our assets and liabilities through our operating subsidiary, Credit RE Operating Company, LLC (the OP\u201d). At December 31, 2018, we owned 97.6% of the OP, as its sole managing member. The remaining 2.4% is owned primarily by our affiliate as noncontrolling interests.\nWe are externally managed by a subsidiary of Colony Capital, a NYSE-listed global real estate and investment management firm with over $22 billion of total consolidated assets and over $43 billion of assets under management. As of December 31, 2018, Colony Capital owned approximately 37% of our common equity on a fully diluted basis, evidencing a strong alignment of interests between Colony Capital and our other stockholders.\nCombination\nOn January 31, 2018, the Combination among the CLNY Contributed Portfolio, NorthStar I, and NorthStar II was completed in an all-stock exchange.\nThe Combination created a prominent publicly traded CRE credit REIT. Our senior executives include Kevin P. Traenkle as the Chief Executive Officer and Neale W. Redington as the Chief Financial Officer. Our board of directors consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.\nRefer to Note 3, Business Combinations\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for further information related to the Combination.\nSignificant Developments\nDuring 2018 and through February 26, 2019, significant developments affecting our business and results of operations included the following:\n \u2022 Completed the Combination of the CLNY Contributed Portfolio, NorthStar I and NorthStar II on January 31, 2018 in an all-stock transaction; \n \u2022 Publicly listed on the NYSE under the ticker CLNC\u201d on February 1, 2018; \n \u2022 Added to U.S. Small-cap Russell 2000 Index, effective June 25, 2018; \n \u2022 2018 gross capital allocation of over $2.0 billion through 37 new investments, including the following: \n \u25e6 Originated 13 senior mortgage loans with a total commitment of $868.7 million; \n \u25e6 Originated one mezzanine loan and one preferred equity investment with total commitments of $76.0 million as well as the upsize of an existing mezzanine loan investment by $43.1 million; \n \u25e6 Acquired at par a preferred equity investment totaling $89.1 million and a mezzanine loan totaling $20.0 million from affiliates of our Manager; \n \u25e6 Entered into two joint ventures with affiliates of our Manager to invest in two separate development projects in Dublin, Ireland for a total commitment of $231.7 million; \n \u25e6 Purchased two net lease portfolios for a total of $618.9 million; \n \u25e6 Purchased 14 CMBS investments with an aggregate face value of $72.6 million at a 19.2% discount; \n \u2022 Secured a $400.0 million corporate revolving credit facility with five relationship banks, and subsequently: \n \u25e6 Upsized the revolving credit facility from $400.0 million to $525.0 million in December 2018; \n \u25e6 Completed an amendment that allows for the ability to borrow in foreign currencies, and; \n \u25e6 On February 4, 2019, increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $35.0 million to $560.0 million; \n \u2022 Increased master repurchase facility by $1.0 billion from $1.1 billion to $2.1 billion; \n \u2022 Recorded $113.9 million of provision for loan losses on eleven loans; \n \u2022 Recorded impairments of operating real estate of $31.8 million, $29.4 million of which resulted from reductions in the estimated holding periods, rent reductions, tenant vacancies of properties; the remaining $2.4 million was the result of the sale of a $177.0 million multi-tenant office portfolio in October 2018; \n \u2022 Declared and paid a monthly dividend of $0.145 per share of Class A common stock and Class B-3 common stock from February through December, representing an annualized dividend of $1.74 per share; \n \u2022 On February 1, 2019, converted all Class B-3 common stock to Class A common stock; and \n \u2022 Subsequent to December 31, 2018, declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of Class A common stock for January and February, as well as Class B common stock for January. \nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nOverview\nOur results of operations are affected by a number of factors and depend primarily on, among other things, the ability of the borrowers of our assets to service our debt as it is due and payable, the ability of our tenants to pay rent and other amounts due under their leases, our ability to actively and effectively service any sub-performing and non-performing loans and other assets we may have from time to time in our portfolio, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities, net leased properties and our other assets, and the level of our net operating income. Our net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of purchase discounts, varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment rates on our CRE loans, prepayment speeds and the ability of our borrowers to make scheduled interest payments. Interest rates and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, credit-worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results also may be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by us or that are included in our CMBS. Our net property operating income depends on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of our real estate equity investments, lease currently available space and continue to attract new tenants.\nChanges in fair value of our assets\nIt is our business strategy to hold our target assets as long-term investments. As a result, we do not expect that changes in the market value of the assets will normally impact our operating results. However, at least on a quarterly basis, we assess both our ability and intent to continue to hold such assets as long-term investments. As part of this process, we monitor our target assets for other-than-temporary\u201d impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our assets could result in our recognizing an impairment charge or realizing losses upon the sale of such securities.\nChanges in market interest rates\nWith respect to our proposed business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the value of fixed-rate investments to decrease; \n \u2022 prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and CMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; \n \u2022 to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to increase.  Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the value of the fixed-rate assets in our portfolio to increase; \n \u2022 prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and CMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; \n \u2022 to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease.  Credit risk\nOne objective of our strategy is to minimize credit losses. However, we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target assets. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses and by deploying a comprehensive review and asset selection process and by careful ongoing\nmonitoring of acquired assets. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nSize of investment portfolio\nThe size of our portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of our commercial mortgage loans, other commercial real estate-related debt investments and the other assets we own, is also a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we earn increases. However, a larger portfolio may result in increased expenses to the extent that we incur additional interest expense to finance our assets.\nMarket conditions\nWe believe that market conditions impact our operating results and will cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and risk profiles of our business change. In addition, changes in government programs could impact our ability to acquire our target assets. Except as set forth above, we are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and real estate, generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition of real estate-related assets, other than those referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of the Combination, comparisons of our period to period financial information as set forth herein may not be meaningful. The historical financial information included herein as of any date, or for any periods, on or prior to January 31, 2018, represents the pre-merger financial information of the CLNY Investment Entities, our accounting predecessor, on a stand-alone basis. The CLNY Investment Entities represent only a portion of our business following the Combination and therefore do not represent the results of operations we would have had for any period prior to the Combination. As of February 1, 2018, our results of operations reflect our operation following the Combination of our accounting predecessor, the CLNY Investment Entities, and NorthStar I and NorthStar II.

increased by $11.4 million to $151.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase of $80.4 million related to the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II loans, preferred equity, and CMBS and an increase of $26.4 million related to originations and acquisitions in 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $83.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities and the repayment of loan investments, as well as a decrease of $11.5 million due to placing the four NY hospitality loans on non-accrual status.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $26.1 million to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $28.1 million increase as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II, a $7.6 million increase related to borrowings on our master repurchase and CMBS credit facilities in 2018, and a $5.5 million increase related to the revolving credit facility entered into on February 1, 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $16.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities and the repayment of securitization bonds payable.\nInterest income on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nInterest income on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to our investment in the subordinate tranches of the consolidated securitization trusts acquired as a result of the Combination.\nProperty and other income\nProperty operating income\nProperty operating income increased by $154.6 million to $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $120.7 million, two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $18.0 million and the two real estate properties acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $14.9 million.\nExpenses\nManagement fee expense\nManagement fee expense represents fees paid to our Manager in accordance with the Management Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management fee expense was $43.2 million. We entered into the Management Agreement on January 31, 2018 and therefore did not incur any management fee expenses prior to this date.\nProperty operating expense\nProperty operating expense increased by $65.6 million to $73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $49.4 million and the two real estate properties acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $11.7 million.\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense represents costs such as professional fees associated with new investments and transactions. Transaction, investment and servicing expense increased by $34.2 million to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $31.9 million of transaction costs associated with the Combination.\nInterest expense on real estate\nInterest expense on real estate increased by $38.3 million to $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $30.7 million and the two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $7.4 million.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $81.8 million to $91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $72.4 million, the two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $8.2 million and the two hotels acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $2.2 million.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses increased by $113.4 million to $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to provisions for loan losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 on our four NY hospitality loans of $53.8 million, four loans collateralized with 28 office, retail, multifamily and industrial properties of $36.8 million, two loans collateralized by retail properties of $15.0 million and one loan collateralized by a retail property of $8.8 million. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Loans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment, net\u201d for further detail.\nImpairment of operating real estate\nImpairment of operating real estate of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to certain retail and student housing properties in our operating real estate portfolio, as well as the multi-tenant office portfolio sold in October 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, Real Estate, net\u201d and Note 15, Fair Value\u201d for further detail.\nAdministrative expense\nAdministrative expense increased by $14.0 million to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to additional reimbursable expenses allocated to us by our Manager as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II in the Combination. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, Related Party Arrangements,\u201d for further information on reimbursement of expenses.\nOther income (loss)\nUnrealized gain on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an unrealized gain on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $5.0 million which represents the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities of the securitization trusts consolidated as a result of our investment in the subordinate tranches of these securitization trusts acquired in the Combination.\nRealized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a realized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $3.4 million which represents a loss incurred from lower than expected future cash flows on a subordinate tranche of a securitization trust.\nOther loss, net\nOther loss, net increased by $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an unrealized loss on non-designated interest rate contracts of $6.0 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain on non-designated foreign exchange contracts of $2.8 million.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures decreased by $0.9 million to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a net loss of $33.5 million related to our PE Investments. This is partially offset by an increase of $20.3 million related to equity method investments acquired as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II, an increase of $8.1 million related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures originated in 2018 and an increase of $5.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $34.9 million to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a tax valuation adjustment recorded in 2018 following an analysis that determined it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset related to its PE Investments will not be realized. This conclusion was reached following the gross $55.2 million unrealized loss recorded during the year on PE Investments, in addition to future income projections. We are currently exploring the potential disposition of our PE Investments.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income\nInterest income decreased by $0.3 million to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income from the loan portfolio existing prior to the tri-party merger among Colony Capital, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance ( NRF\u201d), which closed on January 10, 2017 (the CLNY Merger\u201d) decreased $15.2 million primarily due to loan sales and repayments, which more than offset the $14.6 million of incremental interest income from $177.2 million of loans receivable acquired from NRF through the CLNY Merger and additional interest income from draws on development loans in 2017.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased by $5.0 million to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the payoff of warehouse facilities in 2017 with proceeds from sales of loan and paydown of securitization bonds through resolutions of underlying loans, partially offset by interest expense incurred on a secured financing transaction in 2017.\nProperty and other income\nProperty operating income, property operating expense and depreciation and amortization\nThese amounts increased significantly in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of Colony Capital's acquisition of 13 net lease properties from NRF through the CLNY Merger totaling $205.4 million. Prior to the CLNY Merger, the CLNY Investment Entities did not hold any real estate except for two properties comprised of two medical office buildings acquired through foreclosure in October 2015 and sold in March 2017 and a hotel acquired through foreclosure in January 2017.\nOther income\nOther income increased by $0.3 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher recovery of expenses from borrowers and other recoveries from resolution of our loan investments.\nExpenses\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense represents costs such as professional fees associated with new investments and transactions. Transaction, investment and servicing expense increased by $0.8 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased legal costs incurred in connection with the sales of loans in 2017.\nInterest expense on real estate\nInterest expense on real estate was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the CLNY Merger as compared, to the year ended December 31, 2016, when we did not hold any mortgage notes.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses decreased by $2.9 million to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Provision for loan loss in 2017 was attributed to a mortgage loan that went into maturity default in November 2017, while the provision for loan loss in 2016 was attributed to a decrease in collateral value of a mortgage loan secured by a hotel which was subsequently foreclosed in January 2017.\nAdministrative expense\nAdministrative expense decreased by $2.8 million to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to the Combination, administrative expenses primarily consisted of corporate-level costs that are either incurred specifically on behalf of the CLNY Investment Entities or an allocation of costs estimated to be applicable to the CLNY Investment Entities, largely based on the relative assets under management of the CLNY Investment Entities to the total assets under management of Colony Capital. The allocated administrative cost was $12.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017, as compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects a combination of a lower percentage of costs allocated to the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the CLNY Merger which increased Colony Capital's total assets under management and synergies from the CLNY Merger which resulted in overall cost savings to Colony Capital.\nOther income (loss)\nOther loss, net\nOther loss, net increased by $0.3 million to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to an unrealized loss on non-designated interest rate contracts.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures increased by $8.6 million to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $7.2 million increase in 2017 driven by additional draws and sales of land under development by one of the equity method investees and a $1.4 million increase due to net earnings from two private real estate funds acquired through the CLNY Merger.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $0.7 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from investments in private real estate funds acquired in the CLNY Merger.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures\nCore Earnings\nWe present Core Earnings, which is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure of our performance. We believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This supplemental financial measure helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and U.S GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current portfolio and operations. We also use Core Earnings to determine the incentive fees we pay to our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 11, Related Party Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In addition, we believe that our investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of us and our peers, and as such, we believe that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to our investors.\nWe define Core Earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders (or, without duplication, the owners of the common equity of our direct subsidiaries, such as our OP) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the expenses incurred in connection with our formation, (iii) the incentive fee, (iv) acquisition costs from successful acquisitions, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the current quarter, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, (vii) one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and (viii) certain material non-cash income or expense items that in the judgment of management should not be included in Core Earnings. For clauses (vii) and (viii), such exclusions shall only be applied after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. Core Earnings reflects adjustments to U.S. GAAP net income to exclude impairment of real estate and provision for loan losses. Such impairment and losses may ultimately be realized, in part or full, upon a sale or monetization of the related investments and such realized losses would be reflected in Core Earnings.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net income or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar non-GAAP supplemental financial measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders to Core Earnings attributable to our common stockholders and noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership (dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(168,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized loss:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of operating real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unrealized loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization and impairment previously adjusted for Core Earnings (loss) on real estate sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments related to noncontrolling interests in investment entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings attributable to Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. common stockholders and noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings per share(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of common shares and OP units(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\n (1) We calculate core earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, based on a weighted-average number of common shares and OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries). For Core Earnings per share, we assume the 44.4 million shares of Class B-3 common stock and the 3.1 million OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries) were outstanding prior to January 31, 2018 to reflect the standalone pre-merger financial information of the accounting acquirer. Following January 31, 2018, we assume approximately 131.0 million of shares of Class A common stock, Class B-3 common stock and OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries) were outstanding. This results in a weighted average share count for the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately 123.8 million shares. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary liquidity needs include commitments to repay borrowings, finance our assets and operations, meet future funding obligations, make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase our shares and fund other general business needs. We use significant cash to make additional investments, repay the principal of and interest on our borrowings and pay other financing costs, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations, which includes making payments to our Manager in accordance with the management agreement.\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities and cash generated from asset sales and investment maturities. However, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our Investment Company Act exclusion, we may use a number of sources to finance our business, including bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), master repurchase facilities and securitizations, as described below. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, we have access to liquidity through public offerings of debt and equity securities. We also expect to invest in a number of our assets through co-investments with other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of our Manager and/or other third parties, which may allow us to pool capital to access larger transactions and diversify investment exposure.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe have a multi-pronged financing strategy that includes an up to $560 million secured revolving credit facility, up to approximately $2.1 billion in secured revolving repurchase facilities, non-recourse securitization financing, commercial mortgages and other asset-level financing structures. In addition, we may use other forms of financing, including additional warehouse facilities, public and private secured and unsecured debt issuances and equity or equity-related securities issuances by us or our subsidiaries. We may also finance a portion of our investments through the syndication of one or more interests in a whole loan or securitization. We will seek to match the nature and duration of the financing with the underlying asset's cash flow, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate.\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio\nThe following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio:\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\n (1) Represents (i) total outstanding secured debt less cash to (ii) total equity, in each case, at period end.  The following table presents our total sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Table 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sources of Corporate Liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Bank credit facility availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total sources of corporate liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPotential Sources of Liquidity\nBank Credit Facilities\nWe use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our business. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates.\nOn February 1, 2018, the OP (together with certain subsidiaries of the OP from time to time party thereto as borrowers, collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the Bank Credit Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the several lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to provide a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million. On December 17, 2018, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments was increased to $525.0 million. On February 4, 2019, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments was increased to $560.0 million.\nAdvances under the Bank Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the applicable Borrower's election, either a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.25%, or a base rate determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin of 1.25%. An unused commitment fee at a rate of 0.25% or 0.35%, per annum, depending on the amount of facility utilization, applies to un-utilized borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Facility. Amounts owing under the Bank Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings with respect to which a LIBOR rate election is in effect.\nThe maximum amount available for borrowing at any time under the Bank Credit Facility is limited to a borrowing base valuation of certain investment assets, with the valuation of such investment assets generally determined according to a percentage of adjusted net book value. As of the date hereof, the borrowing base valuation is sufficient to support the outstanding borrowings. The Bank Credit Facility will mature on February 1, 2022, unless the OP elects to exercise the extension options for up to two (2) additional terms of six (6) months each, subject to the terms and conditions in the Bank Credit Facility, resulting in a latest maturity date of February 1, 2023.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Bank Credit Facility are guaranteed by substantially all material wholly owned subsidiaries of the OP pursuant to a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement with the OP and certain subsidiaries of the OP in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d) and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a pledge of substantially all equity interests owned by the Borrowers and the guarantors, as well as by a security interest in deposit accounts of the Borrowers and the Guarantors (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) in which the proceeds of investment asset distributions are maintained.\nThe Bank Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, the obligation of the Company to maintain REIT status and be listed on the NYSE, and limitations on debt, liens and restricted payments. In addition, the Bank Credit Facility includes the following financial covenants applicable to the OP and its consolidated subsidiaries: (a) consolidated tangible net worth of the OP must be greater than or equal to the sum of (i) $2.105 billion and (ii) 50% of the proceeds received by the OP from any offering of its common equity and of the proceeds from any offering by the Company of its common equity to the extent such proceeds are contributed to the OP, excluding any such proceeds that are contributed to the OP within ninety (90) days of receipt and applied to acquire capital stock of the OP; (b) the OP's earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, and amortization plus lease expenses to fixed charges for any period of four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters must be not less than 1.50 to 1.00; (c) the OP's interest coverage ratio must be not less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (d) the OP's ratio of\nconsolidated total debt to consolidated total assets must be not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The Bank Credit Facility also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants or representations, cross default to material indebtedness or material judgment defaults, bankruptcy matters involving any Borrower or any Guarantor and certain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default will limit the ability of the OP and its subsidiaries to make distributions and may result in the termination of the credit facility, acceleration of repayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to the collateral.\nMaster Repurchase Facilities and CMBS Credit Facilities\nCurrently, our primary source of financing is our master repurchase facilities, which we use to finance the origination of senior loans, and CMBS credit facilities, which we use to finance the purchase of securities. Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans, participations and securities that we own in an amount generally equal to (i) the market value of such loans, participations and/or securities multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we sell our loans, participations and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans, participations and securities and pay interest to the lender under the master repurchase agreement. We intend to maintain formal relationships with multiple counterparties to obtain master repurchase financing on favorable terms.\nThe following table presents a summary of our master repurchase facilities as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum Facility Size\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Final Maturity (Years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Interest Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Master Repurchase Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Master Repurchase Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>880,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMBS Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR + 1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CMBS Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> LIBOR + 2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,765,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,365,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\n (1) The maturity dates on CMBS Credit Facilities are dependent upon asset type and will typically range from one to two months.  Securitizations\nWe may seek to utilize non-recourse long-term securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans, especially loan originations, to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our REIT qualification and exclusion from the Investment Company Act in order to generate cash for funding new investments. This would involve conveying a pool of assets to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which would issue one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes would be secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we would receive the cash proceeds on the sale of non-recourse notes and a 100% interest in the equity of the issuing entity. The securitization of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because any equity interest we retain in the issuing entity would be subordinate to the notes issued to investors and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a securitized pool of assets before the owners of the notes experience any losses.\nOther potential sources of financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including secured and unsecured forms of borrowing and selective wind-down and dispositions of assets. We may also seek to raise equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(467,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>487,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(551,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(319,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash inflows from operating activities are generated primarily through interest received from loans receivable and securities, property operating income from our real estate portfolio, and distributions of earnings received from unconsolidated ventures. This is partially offset by payment of interest expenses for credit facilities and mortgage payable, and operating expenses supporting our various lines of business, including property management and operations, loan servicing and workout of loans in default, investment transaction costs, as well as general administrative costs.\nOur operating activities generated cash flows of $100.7 million, $107.0 million and $88.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of transaction costs paid in connection with the Combination offset by additional cash inflows related to the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of additional cash inflows generated by properties acquired in the CLNY Merger.\nWe believe cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities include cash outlays for acquisition of real estate, disbursements on new and/or existing loans, and contributions to unconsolidated ventures, which are partially offset by repayments and sales of loan receivables, distributions of capital received from unconsolidated ventures, proceeds from sale of real estate, as well as proceeds from maturity or sale of securities.\nInvesting activities in 2018 used net cash outflow of $467.7 million, resulting from acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $919.5 million, acquisition of and additions to real estate, related intangibles and leasing commissions of $415.1 million, investment in unconsolidated ventures of $239.7 million, acquisition of real estate securities, available for sale of $58.7 million, and deposit on investments of $29.4 million, partially offset by repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $626.6 million, cash received in the Combination of $328.5 million, proceeds from sale of real estate of $167.9 million, and distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated ventures of $98.5 million.\nInvesting activities in 2017 generated net cash inflow of $439.3 million, resulting from repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $537.5 million, distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated ventures of $55.1 million, cash received in excess of accretion on purchased credit impaired loans of $52.4 million, proceeds from sale of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $17.5 million and proceeds from sale of real estate of $8.9 million, partially offset by acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $200.2 million and investment in unconsolidated ventures of $16.3 million.\nInvesting activities in 2016 generated net cash inflow of $199.4 million, resulting from repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $357.0 million, proceeds from sale of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $141.5 million and cash received in excess of accretion on purchased credit impaired loans of $18.1 million, partially offset by acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $257.6 million and investment in unconsolidated ventures of $21.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe finance our investing activities largely through borrowings secured by our investments along with capital from third party or affiliated coinvestors. We also have the ability to raise capital in the public markets through issuances of common stock, as well as draw upon our corporate credit facility, to finance our investing and operating activities. Accordingly, we incur cash outlays for payments on third party debt, dividends to our common stockholders as well as distributions to our noncontrolling interests.\nFinancing activities in 2018 generated net cash inflow of $487.5 million, resulting from borrowings from credit facilities in the amount of $1.7 billion and borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $246.4 million, partially offset by repayment of credit facilities in the amount of $999.3 million, distributions paid on common stock in the amount of $189.8 million, repayment of securitization bonds in the amount of $108.2 million, and repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $141.8 million.\nFinancing activities in 2017 used net cash outflow of $551.7 million, resulting from repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $342.9 million, distributions paid to CLNY owners in the amount of $299.3 million and distribution paid to noncontrolling interest in the amount of $113.0 million, partially offset by contributions from CLNY owners in the amount of $81.5 million, borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $72.2 million and contributions from noncontrolling interest in the amount of $50.5 million.\nFinancing activities in 2016 used net cash outflow of $319.7 million, resulting from repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $407.3 million, distributions paid to CLNY owners in the amount of $122.1 million and distribution paid to noncontrolling interest in the amount of $77.8 million, partially offset by contributions from CLNY owners in the amount of $113.0 million, contributions from noncontrolling interest in the amount of $95.6 million and borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $81.1 million.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies of the Company\nThe following table sets forth the known contractual obligations of the Company on an undiscounted basis. This table excludes obligations of the Company that are not fixed and determinable, including the Management Agreement (dollars in thousands):\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024 and Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,705,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,090,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitization bonds payable(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,153,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,103,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lending commitments(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,309,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________\n (1) Future interest payments were estimated based on the applicable index at December 31, 2018 and unused commitment fee of 0.25% per annum, assuming principal is repaid on the current maturity date of February 2022. \n (2) Amounts include minimum principal and interest obligations through the initial maturity date of the collateral assets. Interest on floating rate debt was determined based on the applicable index at December 31, 2018. \n (3) The timing of future principal payments was estimated based on expected future cash flows of underlying collateral loans. Repayments are estimated to be earlier than contractual maturity only if proceeds from underlying loans are repaid by the borrowers. \n (4) The Company assumed noncancellable operating ground leases as lessee or sublessee in connection with net lease properties acquired through the CLNY Contributions. The amounts represent minimum future base rent commitments through initial expiration dates of the respective leases, excluding any contingent rent payments. Rents paid under ground leases are recoverable from tenants. \n (5) Future lending commitments may be subject to certain conditions that borrowers must meet to qualify for such fundings. Commitment amount assumes future fundings meet the terms to qualify for such fundings. \nGuarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nUnderwriting, Asset and Risk Management\nOur Manager closely monitors our portfolio and actively manages risks associated with, among other things, our assets and interest rates. Prior to investing in any particular asset, our Manager's underwriting team, in conjunction with third party providers, undertakes a rigorous asset-level due diligence process, involving intensive data collection and analysis, to ensure that we\nunderstand fully the state of the market and the risk-reward profile of the asset. Prior to making a final investment decision, our Manager focuses on portfolio diversification to determine whether a target asset will cause our portfolio to be too heavily concentrated with, or cause too much risk exposure to, any one borrower, real estate sector, geographic region, source of cash flow for payment or other geopolitical issues. If our Manager determines that a proposed acquisition presents excessive concentration risk, it may determine not to acquire an otherwise attractive asset.\nFor each asset that we acquire, our Manager's asset management team engages in active management of the asset, the intensity of which depends on the attendant risks. The asset manager works collaboratively with the underwriting team to formulate a strategic plan for the particular asset, which includes evaluating the underlying collateral and updating valuation assumptions to reflect changes in the real estate market and the general economy. This plan also generally outlines several strategies for the asset to extract the maximum amount of value from each asset under a variety of market conditions. Such strategies may vary depending on the type of asset, the availability of refinancing options, recourse and maturity, but may include, among others, the restructuring of non-performing or sub-performing loans, the negotiation of discounted pay-offs or other modification of the terms governing a loan, and the foreclosure and management of assets underlying non-performing loans in order to reposition them for profitable disposition. Our Manager and its affiliates will continuously track the progress of an asset against the original business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to own the asset do not outweigh the associated rewards. Under these circumstances, certain assets will require intensified asset management in order to achieve optimal value realization.\nOur Manager's asset management team engages in a proactive and comprehensive on-going review of the credit quality of each asset it manages. In particular for debt investments, on at least an annual basis, the asset management team will evaluate the financial wherewithal of individual borrowers to meet contractual obligations as well as review the financial stability of the assets securing such debt investments. Further, there is ongoing review of borrower covenant compliance including the ability of borrowers to meet certain negotiated debt service coverage ratios and debt yield tests. For equity investments, the asset management team, with the assistance of third party property managers, monitors and reviews key metrics such as occupancy, same store sales, tenant payment rates, property budgets and capital expenditures. If through this analysis of credit quality, the asset management team encounters declines in credit not in accord with the original business plan, the team evaluates the risks and determine what changes, if any, are required to the business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to hold the investment do not outweigh the associated rewards.\nIn addition, the audit committee of our board of directors, in consultation with management, periodically reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including key risks to which we are subject, including credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases at our multifamily and student housing properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our multifamily and student housing properties.\nRefer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nCertain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nWe consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest by first considering if an entity meets the definition of a VIE for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, or if we have the power to control an entity through a majority of voting interest or through other arrangements.\nVariable Interest Entities-A VIE is an entity that either (i) lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; (ii) whose equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest; or (iii) is established with non-substantive voting rights. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE through (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. We also consider interests held by our related parties, including de facto agents. We assess whether we are members of a related party group that collectively meets the power and benefits criteria and, if so, whether we are most closely associated with the VIE. In performing the related party analysis, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: the amount and characteristics of their investment relative to the related party; our ability and the related party's ability to control or significantly influence key decisions of the VIE including consideration of involvement by de facto agents; the obligation or likelihood for us or the related party to fund operating losses of the VIE; and the similarity and significance of the VIE's business to our activities and to those of the related party. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE, and whether we are the primary beneficiary, may involve significant judgment, including the determination of which activities most significantly affect the entities' performance, and estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of assets held by the VIE.\nVoting Interest Entities-Unlike VIEs, voting interest entities have sufficient equity to finance their activities and equity investors exhibit the characteristics of a controlling financial interest through their voting rights. We consolidate such entities when we have the power to control these entities through ownership of a majority of the entities' voting interests or through other arrangements.\nAt each reporting period, we reassess whether changes in facts and circumstances cause a change in the status of an entity as a VIE or voting interest entity, and/or a change in our consolidation assessment. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively. An entity may be consolidated as a result of this reassessment, in which case, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest in the entity are recorded at fair value upon initial consolidation. Any existing equity interest we hold in the entity prior to us obtaining control will be remeasured at fair value, which may result in a gain or loss recognized upon initial consolidation. However, if the consolidation represents an asset acquisition of a voting interest entity, our existing interest in the acquired assets, if any, is not remeasured to fair value but continues to be carried at historical cost. We may also deconsolidate a subsidiary as a result of this reassessment, which may result in a gain or loss recognized upon deconsolidation depending on the carrying values of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of any interests retained.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is based on an exit price, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to estimated fair values are made to appropriately reflect counterparty credit risk as well as our own credit-worthiness.\nThe estimated fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are categorized into a three-tier hierarchy, prioritized based on the level of transparency in inputs used in the valuation techniques, as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in non-active markets, or valuation techniques utilizing inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable data directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3-At least one assumption or input is unobservable and it is significant to the fair value measurement, requiring significant management judgment or estimate.\nWhere the inputs used to measure the fair value of a financial instrument fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the financial instrument is categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe evaluate each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business. If substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. If not, for an acquisition to be considered a business, it would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e., there is a continuation of revenue before and after the transaction). A substantive process is not ancillary or minor, cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay or is otherwise considered unique or scarce. To qualify as a business without outputs, the acquired assets would require an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to perform a substantive process.\nNet cash paid to acquire a business or assets is classified as investing activities on the accompanying statements of cash flows.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity, net of fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require significant estimates and assumptions.\nFor acquisitions that are not deemed to be businesses, the assets acquired are recognized based on their cost to us as the acquirer, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the carrying amount of the assets acquired. The cost of assets acquired in a group is allocated to individual assets within the group based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill. Transaction costs related to acquisition of assets are included in the cost basis of the assets acquired.\nThe acquisitions of NorthStar I and NorthStar II were each accounted for under the acquisition method for a business combination. See Note 3, Business Combinations\u201d, to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nLoans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment\nWe originate and purchase loans and preferred equity held for investment. The accounting framework for loans receivable depends on our strategy whether to hold or sell the loan, whether the loan was credit-impaired at the time of acquisition, or whether the lending arrangement is an Acquisition, Development and Construction ( ADC\u201d) loan.\nLoans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment\nLoans and preferred equity that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment. Originated loans and preferred equity are recorded at amortized cost, or outstanding unpaid principal balance plus exit fees less net deferred loan fees. Net deferred loan fees include unamortized origination and other fees charged to the borrower less direct incremental loan origination costs incurred by us. Purchased loans are recorded at amortized cost, or unpaid principal balance plus purchase premium or less unamortized discount. Costs to purchase loans and preferred equity are expensed as incurred.\nInterest Income-Interest income is recognized based upon contractual interest rate and unpaid principal balance of the loans. Net deferred loan fees on originated loans are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest income over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method. Premium or discount on purchased loans are amortized as adjustments to interest income over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method. For revolving loans, net deferred loan fees, premium or discount are amortized to interest income using the straight-line method. When a loan is prepaid, prepayment fees and any excess of proceeds over the carrying amount of the loan are recognized as additional interest income.\nNonaccrual-Accrual of interest income is suspended on nonaccrual loans and preferred equity investments. Loans and preferred equity that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, are generally considered nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual. Interest receivable is reversed against interest income when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collected is recognized on a cash basis by crediting income when received; or if ultimate collectability of loan and preferred equity principal is uncertain, interest collected is recognized using a cost recovery method by applying interest collected as a reduction to loan and preferred equity carrying value. Loans and preferred equity investments may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest are current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest are reasonably assured.\nImpairment and Allowance for Loan Losses-On a periodic basis, we analyze the extent and effect of any credit migration from underwriting and the initial investment review associated with the performance of a loan and preferred equity investment and/or value of its underlying collateral, financial and operating capability of the borrower or sponsor, as well as amount and status of any senior loan, where applicable. Specifically, operating results of collateral properties and any cash reserves are analyzed and\nused to assess whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover debt service requirements currently and into the future, ability of the borrower to refinance the loan or preferred equity investment, liquidation value of collateral properties, and financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors, as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the collateral properties. Such analysis is performed at least quarterly, or more often as needed when impairment indicators are present. During the year of 2018, we recorded a $113.9 million provision for loan loss. See Note 4, Loans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment, net\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nLoans and preferred equity investments are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with contractual terms of the loans and preferred equity investments, including consideration of underlying collateral value. Allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in loans and preferred equity held for investment at balance sheet date. Changes in allowance for loan and preferred equity losses are recorded in the provision for loan losses on the statement of operations. Allowance for loan losses generally exclude interest receivable as accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan or preferred equity investment is placed on nonaccrual status. Allowance for loan losses is generally measured as the difference between the carrying value of the loan or preferred equity investment and either the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan or preferred equity investment or an observable market price for the loan or preferred equity investment. Subsequent changes in impairment are recorded as adjustments to the provision for loan losses. Loans and preferred equity investments are charged off against allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. A loan or preferred equity investment is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan or preferred equity investment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and preferred equity investments are written down to the fair value of the collateral less disposal cost, first through a charge-off against allowance for loan losses, if any, then recorded as impairment loss.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring-A loan with contractual terms modified in a manner that grants concession to the borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a TDR. Concessions could include term extensions, payment deferrals, interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance, or other actions designed to maximize our collection on the loan. As a TDR is generally considered to be an impaired loan, it is measured for impairment based on our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans that we intend to sell or liquidate in the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value less disposal cost, with valuation changes recognized as impairment loss. Loans held for sale are not subject to allowance for loan losses. Net deferred loan origination fees and loan purchase premiums or discounts are deferred and capitalized as part of the carrying value of the held for sale loan until the loan is sold and are therefore included in the periodic valuation adjustments based on lower of cost or fair value less disposal cost.\nADC Arrangements\nWe provide loans to third party developers for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under an ADC arrangement, we participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or other use of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each ADC arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. ADC arrangements with characteristics implying loan classification are presented as loans held for investment and result in the recognition of interest income. ADC arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are presented as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and are accounted for using the equity method. The classification of each ADC arrangement as either loan receivable or real estate joint venture involves significant judgment and relies on various factors, including market conditions, amount and timing of expected residual profits, credit enhancements in the form of guaranties, estimated fair value of the collateral, and significance of borrower equity in the project, among others. The classification of ADC arrangements is performed at inception, and periodically reassessed when significant changes occur in the circumstances or conditions described above.\nOperating real estate\nReal estate acquisitions-Real estate acquired in acquisitions that are deemed to be business combinations is recorded at the fair values of the acquired components at the time of acquisition, allocated among land, buildings, improvements, equipment and lease-related tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including foregone leasing costs, in-place lease values and above-or below-market lease values. Real estate acquired in acquisitions that are deemed to be asset acquisitions is recorded at the total value of consideration transferred, including transaction costs, allocated to the acquired components based upon relative fair value. The estimated fair value of acquired land is derived from recent comparable sales of land and listings within the same local region based on available market data. The estimated fair value of acquired buildings and building improvements is derived from comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis using market-based assumptions, or replacement cost, as appropriate. The fair value of site and tenant improvements is estimated based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nReal estate held for investment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nCosts Capitalized or Expensed-Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while expenditures for significant renovations that improve or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation-Real estate held for investment, other than land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Term\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building (fee interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19 to 48 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building leasehold interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lesser of remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lesser of the useful life or remaining life of the building\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6 to 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lesser of the useful life or remaining term of the lease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 to 8 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nImpairment-We evaluate our real estate held for investment for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate real estate for impairment generally on an individual property basis. If an impairment indicator exists, we evaluate the undiscounted future net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the property, including any estimated proceeds from the eventual disposition of the property. If multiple outcomes are under consideration, we may apply a probability-weighted approach to the impairment analysis. Based upon the analysis, if the carrying value of a property exceeds its undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property. In evaluating and/or measuring impairment, we consider, among other things, current and estimated future cash flows associated with each property, market information for each sub-market, including, where applicable, competition levels, foreclosure levels, leasing trends, occupancy trends, lease or room rates, and the market prices of similar properties recently sold or currently being offered for sale, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. Another key consideration in this assessment is our assumption about the highest and best use of our real estate investments and our intent and ability to hold them for a reasonable period that would allow for the recovery of their carrying values. If such assumptions change and we shorten its expected hold period, this may result in the recognition of impairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $31.8 million impairment loss on our operating real estate portfolio. See Note 7, Real Estate, net\u201d and Note 15, Fair Value,\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nReal estate held for sale\nClassification as held for sale-Real estate is classified as held for sale in the period when (i) management approves a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms, (iii) a program is initiated to locate a buyer and actively market the asset for sale at a reasonable price, and (iv) completion of the sale is probable within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal cost, with any write-down to fair value less disposal cost recorded as an impairment loss. For any increase in fair value less disposal cost subsequent to classification as held for sale, the impairment loss may be reversed, but only up to the amount of cumulative loss previously recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell the real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been continuously classified as held for investment, and (ii) its estimated fair value at the time we decide not to sell.\nReal estate sales-We evaluate if real estate sale transactions qualify for recognition under the full accrual method, considering whether, among other criteria, the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay, any receivable due to us is not subject to future subordination, we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold real estate. At the time the sale is consummated, a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between the sale price less disposal cost and the carrying value of the real estate.\nForeclosed properties\nWe receive foreclosed properties in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. Foreclosed properties are recognized, generally, at the time the real estate is received at foreclosure sale or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties are initially measured at fair value. Deficiencies compared to the carrying value of the loan, after reversing any previously recognized loss provision on the loan, are recorded as impairment loss. We periodically evaluate foreclosed properties for subsequent decrease in fair value, which is recorded as additional impairment loss. Fair value of foreclosed properties is generally based on third party appraisals, broker price opinions, comparable sales or a combination thereof.\nReal Estate Securities\nWe classify our CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. However, we have elected the fair value option for the assets and liabilities of our investments in securitization financing entities ( Investing VIEs\u201d), and as a result, any unrealized gains (losses) on the consolidated Investing VIEs are recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, we held subordinate tranches of three securitization trusts, which represent our retained interest in the securitization trusts, which we consolidate under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 6, Real Estate Securities, Available for Sale\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nInterest Income-Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security. Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income.\nImpairment-CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) as any change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trust, net as losses occur.\nCRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly. Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses. The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow. The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any OTTI recorded on our CRE securities.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using one of (i) equity method where applicable; (ii) fair value option if elected; (iii) fair value through earnings if fair value is readily determinable, including election of NAV practical expedient where applicable; or (iv) for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the measurement alternative to measure at cost adjusted for any impairment and observable price changes, as applicable.\nFair value changes of equity method investments under the fair value option are recorded in earnings from investments in unconsolidated ventures. Fair value changes of other equity investments, including adjustments for observable price changes under the measurement alternative, are recorded in other gain (loss).\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments under the equity method of accounting if they have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an entity, but do not have a controlling financial interest. The equity method investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for capital contributions, distributions and our share of the entity's net income or loss as well as other comprehensive income or loss. Our share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in an entity if the governing documents prescribe a substantive non-proportionate earnings allocation formula or a preferred return to certain investors. For certain equity method investments, we record our proportionate share of income on a one to three month lag. Distributions of operating profits from equity method investments are reported as operating activities, while distributions in excess of operating profits while distributions in excess of operating profits are reported as investing activities in the statement of cash flows under the cumulative earnings approach.\nAt December 31, 2018, our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of investments in PE Investments, senior loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity held in joint ventures, as well as ADC loan arrangements accounted for as equity method investments. At December 31, 2017, our investments in unconsolidated ventures consisted of investments in PE Investments and ADC loan arrangements accounted for as equity method investments.\nImpairment\nEvaluation of impairment applies to equity method investments and equity investments under the measurement alternative. If indicators of impairment exist, we will first estimate the fair value of its investment. In assessing fair value, we generally consider, among others, the estimated enterprise value of the investee or fair value of the investee's underlying net assets, including net cash flows to be generated by the investee as applicable.\nFor investments under the measurement alternative, if carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, an impairment is deemed to have occurred.\nFor equity method investments, further consideration is made if a decrease in value of the investment is other-than-temporary to determine if impairment loss should be recognized. Assessment of other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") involves management judgment, including, but not limited to, consideration of the investee's financial condition, operating results, business prospects and creditworthiness, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery of its carrying value, or a significant and prolonged decline in traded price of the investee's equity security. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that we may not fully recover the carrying value of its investment, then the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.\nInvestments that are other-than-temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value. Impairment loss is recorded in earnings from investments in unconsolidated ventures for equity method investments and in other gain (loss) for investments under the measurement alternative.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nSale accounting for transfers of financial assets is limited to the transfer of an entire financial asset, a group of financial assets in their entirety, or a component of a financial asset that meets the definition of a participating interest by having characteristics that are similar to the original financial asset.\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. If we have any continuing involvement, rights or obligations with the transferred financial asset (outside of standard representations and warranties), sale accounting would require that the transfer meets the following conditions: (1) the transferred asset has been legally isolated; (2) the transferee has the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred asset; and (3) we do not maintain effective control over the transferred asset through an agreement that provides for (a) both an entitlement and an obligation by us to repurchase or redeem the asset before its maturity, (b) our unilateral ability to reclaim the asset and a more than trivial benefit attributable to that ability, or (c) the transferee requiring us to repurchase the asset at a price so favorable to the transferee that it is probable the repurchase will occur.\nIf the criteria for sale accounting are met, the transferred financial asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized upon sale, taking into account any retained interests. Transfers of financial assets that do not meet the criteria for sale are accounted for as financing transactions.\nRecent Accounting Updates\nRecent accounting updates are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Annual Report Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes, Risk Factors,\u201d Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Business\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction\nWe are a CRE credit REIT focused on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net leased properties predominantly in the United States. CRE debt investments include senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. CRE debt securities primarily consist of CMBS (including B-pieces\u201d of a CMBS securitization pool) or CRE CLOs (collateralized by pools of CRE debt investments). Net leased properties consist of CRE properties with long-term leases to tenants on a net-lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance capital expenditures and real estate taxes.\nWe were organized in the state of Maryland on August 23, 2017. On September 15, 2017, Colony Capital, a publicly traded REIT listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CLNY,\u201d made an initial capital contribution of $1,000 to us. We intend to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. We conduct all of our activities and hold substantially all of our assets and liabilities through our operating subsidiary, Credit RE Operating Company, LLC (the OP\u201d). At December 31, 2018, we owned 97.6% of the OP, as its sole managing member. The remaining 2.4% is owned primarily by our affiliate as noncontrolling interests.\nWe are externally managed by a subsidiary of Colony Capital, a NYSE-listed global real estate and investment management firm with over $22 billion of total consolidated assets and over $43 billion of assets under management. As of December 31, 2018, Colony Capital owned approximately 37% of our common equity on a fully diluted basis, evidencing a strong alignment of interests between Colony Capital and our other stockholders.\nCombination\nOn January 31, 2018, the Combination among the CLNY Contributed Portfolio, NorthStar I, and NorthStar II was completed in an all-stock exchange.\nThe Combination created a prominent publicly traded CRE credit REIT. Our senior executives include Kevin P. Traenkle as the Chief Executive Officer and Neale W. Redington as the Chief Financial Officer. Our board of directors consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.\nRefer to Note 3, Business Combinations\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for further information related to the Combination.\nSignificant Developments\nDuring 2018 and through February 26, 2019, significant developments affecting our business and results of operations included the following:\n \u2022 Completed the Combination of the CLNY Contributed Portfolio, NorthStar I and NorthStar II on January 31, 2018 in an all-stock transaction; \n \u2022 Publicly listed on the NYSE under the ticker CLNC\u201d on February 1, 2018; \n \u2022 Added to U.S. Small-cap Russell 2000 Index, effective June 25, 2018; \n \u2022 2018 gross capital allocation of over $2.0 billion through 37 new investments, including the following: \n \u25e6 Originated 13 senior mortgage loans with a total commitment of $868.7 million; \n \u25e6 Originated one mezzanine loan and one preferred equity investment with total commitments of $76.0 million as well as the upsize of an existing mezzanine loan investment by $43.1 million; \n \u25e6 Acquired at par a preferred equity investment totaling $89.1 million and a mezzanine loan totaling $20.0 million from affiliates of our Manager; \n \u25e6 Entered into two joint ventures with affiliates of our Manager to invest in two separate development projects in Dublin, Ireland for a total commitment of $231.7 million; \n \u25e6 Purchased two net lease portfolios for a total of $618.9 million; \n \u25e6 Purchased 14 CMBS investments with an aggregate face value of $72.6 million at a 19.2% discount; \n \u2022 Secured a $400.0 million corporate revolving credit facility with five relationship banks, and subsequently: \n \u25e6 Upsized the revolving credit facility from $400.0 million to $525.0 million in December 2018; \n \u25e6 Completed an amendment that allows for the ability to borrow in foreign currencies, and; \n \u25e6 On February 4, 2019, increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $35.0 million to $560.0 million; \n \u2022 Increased master repurchase facility by $1.0 billion from $1.1 billion to $2.1 billion; \n \u2022 Recorded $113.9 million of provision for loan losses on eleven loans; \n \u2022 Recorded impairments of operating real estate of $31.8 million, $29.4 million of which resulted from reductions in the estimated holding periods, rent reductions, tenant vacancies of properties; the remaining $2.4 million was the result of the sale of a $177.0 million multi-tenant office portfolio in October 2018; \n \u2022 Declared and paid a monthly dividend of $0.145 per share of Class A common stock and Class B-3 common stock from February through December, representing an annualized dividend of $1.74 per share; \n \u2022 On February 1, 2019, converted all Class B-3 common stock to Class A common stock; and \n \u2022 Subsequent to December 31, 2018, declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of Class A common stock for January and February, as well as Class B common stock for January. \nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nOverview\nOur results of operations are affected by a number of factors and depend primarily on, among other things, the ability of the borrowers of our assets to service our debt as it is due and payable, the ability of our tenants to pay rent and other amounts due under their leases, our ability to actively and effectively service any sub-performing and non-performing loans and other assets we may have from time to time in our portfolio, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities, net leased properties and our other assets, and the level of our net operating income. Our net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of purchase discounts, varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, prepayment rates on our CRE loans, prepayment speeds and the ability of our borrowers to make scheduled interest payments. Interest rates and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, credit-worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results also may be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by us or that are included in our CMBS. Our net property operating income depends on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of our real estate equity investments, lease currently available space and continue to attract new tenants.\nChanges in fair value of our assets\nIt is our business strategy to hold our target assets as long-term investments. As a result, we do not expect that changes in the market value of the assets will normally impact our operating results. However, at least on a quarterly basis, we assess both our ability and intent to continue to hold such assets as long-term investments. As part of this process, we monitor our target assets for other-than-temporary\u201d impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our assets could result in our recognizing an impairment charge or realizing losses upon the sale of such securities.\nChanges in market interest rates\nWith respect to our proposed business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the value of fixed-rate investments to decrease; \n \u2022 prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and CMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; \n \u2022 to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to increase.  Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the value of the fixed-rate assets in our portfolio to increase; \n \u2022 prepayments on certain assets in our portfolio to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and CMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; \n \u2022 to the extent we use leverage to finance our assets, the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease.  Credit risk\nOne objective of our strategy is to minimize credit losses. However, we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target assets. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses and by deploying a comprehensive review and asset selection process and by careful ongoing\nmonitoring of acquired assets. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nSize of investment portfolio\nThe size of our portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of our commercial mortgage loans, other commercial real estate-related debt investments and the other assets we own, is also a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we earn increases. However, a larger portfolio may result in increased expenses to the extent that we incur additional interest expense to finance our assets.\nMarket conditions\nWe believe that market conditions impact our operating results and will cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and risk profiles of our business change. In addition, changes in government programs could impact our ability to acquire our target assets. Except as set forth above, we are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and real estate, generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition of real estate-related assets, other than those referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of the Combination, comparisons of our period to period financial information as set forth herein may not be meaningful. The historical financial information included herein as of any date, or for any periods, on or prior to January 31, 2018, represents the pre-merger financial information of the CLNY Investment Entities, our accounting predecessor, on a stand-alone basis. The CLNY Investment Entities represent only a portion of our business following the Combination and therefore do not represent the results of operations we would have had for any period prior to the Combination. As of February 1, 2018, our results of operations reflect our operation following the Combination of our accounting predecessor, the CLNY Investment Entities, and NorthStar I and NorthStar II. The results of operations of NorthStar I and NorthStar II are incorporated into ours effective from February 1, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (Dollars in Thousands):\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income\nInterest income increased by $11.4 million to $151.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase of $80.4 million related to the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II loans, preferred equity, and CMBS and an increase of $26.4 million related to originations and acquisitions in 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $83.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities and the repayment of loan investments, as well as a decrease of $11.5 million due to placing the four NY hospitality loans on non-accrual status.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $26.1 million to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $28.1 million increase as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II, a $7.6 million increase related to borrowings on our master repurchase and CMBS credit facilities in 2018, and a $5.5 million increase related to the revolving credit facility entered into on February 1, 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $16.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities and the repayment of securitization bonds payable.\nInterest income on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nInterest income on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to our investment in the subordinate tranches of the consolidated securitization trusts acquired as a result of the Combination.\nProperty and other income\nProperty operating income\nProperty operating income increased by $154.6 million to $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $120.7 million, two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $18.0 million and the two real estate properties acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $14.9 million.\nExpenses\nManagement fee expense\nManagement fee expense represents fees paid to our Manager in accordance with the Management Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management fee expense was $43.2 million. We entered into the Management Agreement on January 31, 2018 and therefore did not incur any management fee expenses prior to this date.\nProperty operating expense\nProperty operating expense increased by $65.6 million to $73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $49.4 million and the two real estate properties acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $11.7 million.\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense represents costs such as professional fees associated with new investments and transactions. Transaction, investment and servicing expense increased by $34.2 million to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $31.9 million of transaction costs associated with the Combination.\nInterest expense on real estate\nInterest expense on real estate increased by $38.3 million to $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $30.7 million and the two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $7.4 million.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $81.8 million to $91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II of $72.4 million, the two net lease portfolios acquired during the third quarter of 2018 of $8.2 million and the two hotels acquired through the legal foreclosure process of $2.2 million.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses increased by $113.4 million to $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to provisions for loan losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 on our four NY hospitality loans of $53.8 million, four loans collateralized with 28 office, retail, multifamily and industrial properties of $36.8 million, two loans collateralized by retail properties of $15.0 million and one loan collateralized by a retail property of $8.8 million. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Loans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment, net\u201d for further detail.\nImpairment of operating real estate\nImpairment of operating real estate of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to certain retail and student housing properties in our operating real estate portfolio, as well as the multi-tenant office portfolio sold in October 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, Real Estate, net\u201d and Note 15, Fair Value\u201d for further detail.\nAdministrative expense\nAdministrative expense increased by $14.0 million to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to additional reimbursable expenses allocated to us by our Manager as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II in the Combination. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, Related Party Arrangements,\u201d for further information on reimbursement of expenses.\nOther income (loss)\nUnrealized gain on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an unrealized gain on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $5.0 million which represents the change in fair value of the assets and liabilities of the securitization trusts consolidated as a result of our investment in the subordinate tranches of these securitization trusts acquired in the Combination.\nRealized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a realized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net of $3.4 million which represents a loss incurred from lower than expected future cash flows on a subordinate tranche of a securitization trust.\nOther loss, net\nOther loss, net increased by $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an unrealized loss on non-designated interest rate contracts of $6.0 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain on non-designated foreign exchange contracts of $2.8 million.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures decreased by $0.9 million to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a net loss of $33.5 million related to our PE Investments. This is partially offset by an increase of $20.3 million related to equity method investments acquired as a result of the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II, an increase of $8.1 million related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures originated in 2018 and an increase of $5.8 million in the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the deconsolidation of certain investment entities.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $34.9 million to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a tax valuation adjustment recorded in 2018 following an analysis that determined it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset related to its PE Investments will not be realized. This conclusion was reached following the gross $55.2 million unrealized loss recorded during the year on PE Investments, in addition to future income projections. We are currently exploring the potential disposition of our PE Investments.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income\nInterest income decreased by $0.3 million to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income from the loan portfolio existing prior to the tri-party merger among Colony Capital, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance ( NRF\u201d), which closed on January 10, 2017 (the CLNY Merger\u201d) decreased $15.2 million primarily due to loan sales and repayments, which more than offset the $14.6 million of incremental interest income from $177.2 million of loans receivable acquired from NRF through the CLNY Merger and additional interest income from draws on development loans in 2017.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased by $5.0 million to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the payoff of warehouse facilities in 2017 with proceeds from sales of loan and paydown of securitization bonds through resolutions of underlying loans, partially offset by interest expense incurred on a secured financing transaction in 2017.\nProperty and other income\nProperty operating income, property operating expense and depreciation and amortization\nThese amounts increased significantly in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of Colony Capital's acquisition of 13 net lease properties from NRF through the CLNY Merger totaling $205.4 million. Prior to the CLNY Merger, the CLNY Investment Entities did not hold any real estate except for two properties comprised of two medical office buildings acquired through foreclosure in October 2015 and sold in March 2017 and a hotel acquired through foreclosure in January 2017.\nOther income\nOther income increased by $0.3 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher recovery of expenses from borrowers and other recoveries from resolution of our loan investments.\nExpenses\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense\nTransaction, investment and servicing expense represents costs such as professional fees associated with new investments and transactions. Transaction, investment and servicing expense increased by $0.8 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased legal costs incurred in connection with the sales of loans in 2017.\nInterest expense on real estate\nInterest expense on real estate was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the operating real estate properties acquired in connection with the CLNY Merger as compared, to the year ended December 31, 2016, when we did not hold any mortgage notes.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses decreased by $2.9 million to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Provision for loan loss in 2017 was attributed to a mortgage loan that went into maturity default in November 2017, while the provision for loan loss in 2016 was attributed to a decrease in collateral value of a mortgage loan secured by a hotel which was subsequently foreclosed in January 2017.\nAdministrative expense\nAdministrative expense decreased by $2.8 million to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to the Combination, administrative expenses primarily consisted of corporate-level costs that are either incurred specifically on behalf of the CLNY Investment Entities or an allocation of costs estimated to be applicable to the CLNY Investment Entities, largely based on the relative assets under management of the CLNY Investment Entities to the total assets under management of Colony Capital. The allocated administrative cost was $12.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017, as compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects a combination of a lower percentage of costs allocated to the CLNY Investment Entities as a result of the CLNY Merger which increased Colony Capital's total assets under management and synergies from the CLNY Merger which resulted in overall cost savings to Colony Capital.\nOther income (loss)\nOther loss, net\nOther loss, net increased by $0.3 million to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to an unrealized loss on non-designated interest rate contracts.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures increased by $8.6 million to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $7.2 million increase in 2017 driven by additional draws and sales of land under development by one of the equity method investees and a $1.4 million increase due to net earnings from two private real estate funds acquired through the CLNY Merger.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $0.7 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from investments in private real estate funds acquired in the CLNY Merger.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures\nCore Earnings\nWe present Core Earnings, which is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure of our performance. We believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This supplemental financial measure helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and U.S GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current portfolio and operations. We also use Core Earnings to determine the incentive fees we pay to our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 11, Related Party Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In addition, we believe that our investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of us and our peers, and as such, we believe that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to our investors.\nWe define Core Earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders (or, without duplication, the owners of the common equity of our direct subsidiaries, such as our OP) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the expenses incurred in connection with our formation, (iii) the incentive fee, (iv) acquisition costs from successful acquisitions, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the current quarter, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, (vii) one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and (viii) certain material non-cash income or expense items that in the judgment of management should not be included in Core Earnings. For clauses (vii) and (viii), such exclusions shall only be applied after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. Core Earnings reflects adjustments to U.S. GAAP net income to exclude impairment of real estate and provision for loan losses. Such impairment and losses may ultimately be realized, in part or full, upon a sale or monetization of the related investments and such realized losses would be reflected in Core Earnings.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net income or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar non-GAAP supplemental financial measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders to Core Earnings attributable to our common stockholders and noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership (dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data):\n\n_________________________________________\n (1) We calculate core earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, based on a weighted-average number of common shares and OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries). For Core Earnings per share, we assume the 44.4 million shares of Class B-3 common stock and the 3.1 million OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries) were outstanding prior to January 31, 2018 to reflect the standalone pre-merger financial information of the accounting acquirer. Following January 31, 2018, we assume approximately 131.0 million of shares of Class A common stock, Class B-3 common stock and OP units (held by members other than us or our subsidiaries) were outstanding. This results in a weighted average share count for the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately 123.8 million shares. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary liquidity needs include commitments to repay borrowings, finance our assets and operations, meet future funding obligations, make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase our shares and fund other general business needs. We use significant cash to make additional investments, repay the principal of and interest on our borrowings and pay other financing costs, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations, which includes making payments to our Manager in accordance with the management agreement.\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities and cash generated from asset sales and investment maturities. However, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our Investment Company Act exclusion, we may use a number of sources to finance our business, including bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), master repurchase facilities and securitizations, as described below. In addition to our current sources of liquidity, we have access to liquidity through public offerings of debt and equity securities. We also expect to invest in a number of our assets through co-investments with other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of our Manager and/or other third parties, which may allow us to pool capital to access larger transactions and diversify investment exposure.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe have a multi-pronged financing strategy that includes an up to $560 million secured revolving credit facility, up to approximately $2.1 billion in secured revolving repurchase facilities, non-recourse securitization financing, commercial mortgages and other asset-level financing structures. In addition, we may use other forms of financing, including additional warehouse facilities, public and private secured and unsecured debt issuances and equity or equity-related securities issuances by us or our subsidiaries. We may also finance a portion of our investments through the syndication of one or more interests in a whole loan or securitization. We will seek to match the nature and duration of the financing with the underlying asset's cash flow, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate.\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio\nThe following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio:\n\n_________________________________________\n (1) Represents (i) total outstanding secured debt less cash to (ii) total equity, in each case, at period end.  The following table presents our total sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): \nPotential Sources of Liquidity\nBank Credit Facilities\nWe use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our business. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates.\nOn February 1, 2018, the OP (together with certain subsidiaries of the OP from time to time party thereto as borrowers, collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the Bank Credit Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the several lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to provide a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million. On December 17, 2018, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments was increased to $525.0 million. On February 4, 2019, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments was increased to $560.0 million.\nAdvances under the Bank Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the applicable Borrower's election, either a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.25%, or a base rate determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin of 1.25%. An unused commitment fee at a rate of 0.25% or 0.35%, per annum, depending on the amount of facility utilization, applies to un-utilized borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Facility. Amounts owing under the Bank Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings with respect to which a LIBOR rate election is in effect.\nThe maximum amount available for borrowing at any time under the Bank Credit Facility is limited to a borrowing base valuation of certain investment assets, with the valuation of such investment assets generally determined according to a percentage of adjusted net book value. As of the date hereof, the borrowing base valuation is sufficient to support the outstanding borrowings. The Bank Credit Facility will mature on February 1, 2022, unless the OP elects to exercise the extension options for up to two (2) additional terms of six (6) months each, subject to the terms and conditions in the Bank Credit Facility, resulting in a latest maturity date of February 1, 2023.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Bank Credit Facility are guaranteed by substantially all material wholly owned subsidiaries of the OP pursuant to a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement with the OP and certain subsidiaries of the OP in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d) and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a pledge of substantially all equity interests owned by the Borrowers and the guarantors, as well as by a security interest in deposit accounts of the Borrowers and the Guarantors (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) in which the proceeds of investment asset distributions are maintained.\nThe Bank Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, the obligation of the Company to maintain REIT status and be listed on the NYSE, and limitations on debt, liens and restricted payments. In addition, the Bank Credit Facility includes the following financial covenants applicable to the OP and its consolidated subsidiaries: (a) consolidated tangible net worth of the OP must be greater than or equal to the sum of (i) $2.105 billion and (ii) 50% of the proceeds received by the OP from any offering of its common equity and of the proceeds from any offering by the Company of its common equity to the extent such proceeds are contributed to the OP, excluding any such proceeds that are contributed to the OP within ninety (90) days of receipt and applied to acquire capital stock of the OP; (b) the OP's earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, and amortization plus lease expenses to fixed charges for any period of four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters must be not less than 1.50 to 1.00; (c) the OP's interest coverage ratio must be not less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (d) the OP's ratio of\nconsolidated total debt to consolidated total assets must be not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The Bank Credit Facility also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants or representations, cross default to material indebtedness or material judgment defaults, bankruptcy matters involving any Borrower or any Guarantor and certain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default will limit the ability of the OP and its subsidiaries to make distributions and may result in the termination of the credit facility, acceleration of repayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to the collateral.\nMaster Repurchase Facilities and CMBS Credit Facilities\nCurrently, our primary source of financing is our master repurchase facilities, which we use to finance the origination of senior loans, and CMBS credit facilities, which we use to finance the purchase of securities. Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans, participations and securities that we own in an amount generally equal to (i) the market value of such loans, participations and/or securities multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we sell our loans, participations and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans, participations and securities and pay interest to the lender under the master repurchase agreement. We intend to maintain formal relationships with multiple counterparties to obtain master repurchase financing on favorable terms.\nThe following table presents a summary of our master repurchase facilities as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n_________________________________________\n (1) The maturity dates on CMBS Credit Facilities are dependent upon asset type and will typically range from one to two months.  Securitizations\nWe may seek to utilize non-recourse long-term securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans, especially loan originations, to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our REIT qualification and exclusion from the Investment Company Act in order to generate cash for funding new investments. This would involve conveying a pool of assets to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which would issue one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes would be secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we would receive the cash proceeds on the sale of non-recourse notes and a 100% interest in the equity of the issuing entity. The securitization of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because any equity interest we retain in the issuing entity would be subordinate to the notes issued to investors and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a securitized pool of assets before the owners of the notes experience any losses.\nOther potential sources of financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including secured and unsecured forms of borrowing and selective wind-down and dispositions of assets. We may also seek to raise equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash inflows from operating activities are generated primarily through interest received from loans receivable and securities, property operating income from our real estate portfolio, and distributions of earnings received from unconsolidated ventures. This is partially offset by payment of interest expenses for credit facilities and mortgage payable, and operating expenses supporting our various lines of business, including property management and operations, loan servicing and workout of loans in default, investment transaction costs, as well as general administrative costs.\nOur operating activities generated cash flows of $100.7 million, $107.0 million and $88.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of transaction costs paid in connection with the Combination offset by additional cash inflows related to the acquisition of NorthStar I and NorthStar II. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of additional cash inflows generated by properties acquired in the CLNY Merger.\nWe believe cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities include cash outlays for acquisition of real estate, disbursements on new and/or existing loans, and contributions to unconsolidated ventures, which are partially offset by repayments and sales of loan receivables, distributions of capital received from unconsolidated ventures, proceeds from sale of real estate, as well as proceeds from maturity or sale of securities.\nInvesting activities in 2018 used net cash outflow of $467.7 million, resulting from acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $919.5 million, acquisition of and additions to real estate, related intangibles and leasing commissions of $415.1 million, investment in unconsolidated ventures of $239.7 million, acquisition of real estate securities, available for sale of $58.7 million, and deposit on investments of $29.4 million, partially offset by repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $626.6 million, cash received in the Combination of $328.5 million, proceeds from sale of real estate of $167.9 million, and distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated ventures of $98.5 million.\nInvesting activities in 2017 generated net cash inflow of $439.3 million, resulting from repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $537.5 million, distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated ventures of $55.1 million, cash received in excess of accretion on purchased credit impaired loans of $52.4 million, proceeds from sale of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $17.5 million and proceeds from sale of real estate of $8.9 million, partially offset by acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $200.2 million and investment in unconsolidated ventures of $16.3 million.\nInvesting activities in 2016 generated net cash inflow of $199.4 million, resulting from repayment on loans and preferred equity held for investment of $357.0 million, proceeds from sale of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $141.5 million and cash received in excess of accretion on purchased credit impaired loans of $18.1 million, partially offset by acquisition, origination and funding of loans and preferred equity held for investment, net of $257.6 million and investment in unconsolidated ventures of $21.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe finance our investing activities largely through borrowings secured by our investments along with capital from third party or affiliated coinvestors. We also have the ability to raise capital in the public markets through issuances of common stock, as well as draw upon our corporate credit facility, to finance our investing and operating activities. Accordingly, we incur cash outlays for payments on third party debt, dividends to our common stockholders as well as distributions to our noncontrolling interests.\nFinancing activities in 2018 generated net cash inflow of $487.5 million, resulting from borrowings from credit facilities in the amount of $1.7 billion and borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $246.4 million, partially offset by repayment of credit facilities in the amount of $999.3 million, distributions paid on common stock in the amount of $189.8 million, repayment of securitization bonds in the amount of $108.2 million, and repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $141.8 million.\nFinancing activities in 2017 used net cash outflow of $551.7 million, resulting from repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $342.9 million, distributions paid to CLNY owners in the amount of $299.3 million and distribution paid to noncontrolling interest in the amount of $113.0 million, partially offset by contributions from CLNY owners in the amount of $81.5 million, borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $72.2 million and contributions from noncontrolling interest in the amount of $50.5 million.\nFinancing activities in 2016 used net cash outflow of $319.7 million, resulting from repayment of mortgage notes in the amount of $407.3 million, distributions paid to CLNY owners in the amount of $122.1 million and distribution paid to noncontrolling interest in the amount of $77.8 million, partially offset by contributions from CLNY owners in the amount of $113.0 million, contributions from noncontrolling interest in the amount of $95.6 million and borrowings from mortgage notes in the amount of $81.1 million.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies of the Company\nThe following table sets forth the known contractual obligations of the Company on an undiscounted basis. This table excludes obligations of the Company that are not fixed and determinable, including the Management Agreement (dollars in thousands):\n\n_________________________________________\n (1) Future interest payments were estimated based on the applicable index at December 31, 2018 and unused commitment fee of 0.25% per annum, assuming principal is repaid on the current maturity date of February 2022. \n (2) Amounts include minimum principal and interest obligations through the initial maturity date of the collateral assets. Interest on floating rate debt was determined based on the applicable index at December 31, 2018. \n (3) The timing of future principal payments was estimated based on expected future cash flows of underlying collateral loans. Repayments are estimated to be earlier than contractual maturity only if proceeds from underlying loans are repaid by the borrowers. \n (4) The Company assumed noncancellable operating ground leases as lessee or sublessee in connection with net lease properties acquired through the CLNY Contributions. The amounts represent minimum future base rent commitments through initial expiration dates of the respective leases, excluding any contingent rent payments. Rents paid under ground leases are recoverable from tenants. \n (5) Future lending commitments may be subject to certain conditions that borrowers must meet to qualify for such fundings. Commitment amount assumes future fundings meet the terms to qualify for such fundings. \nGuarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nUnderwriting, Asset and Risk Management\nOur Manager closely monitors our portfolio and actively manages risks associated with, among other things, our assets and interest rates. Prior to investing in any particular asset, our Manager's underwriting team, in conjunction with third party providers, undertakes a rigorous asset-level due diligence process, involving intensive data collection and analysis, to ensure that we\nunderstand fully the state of the market and the risk-reward profile of the asset. Prior to making a final investment decision, our Manager focuses on portfolio diversification to determine whether a target asset will cause our portfolio to be too heavily concentrated with, or cause too much risk exposure to, any one borrower, real estate sector, geographic region, source of cash flow for payment or other geopolitical issues. If our Manager determines that a proposed acquisition presents excessive concentration risk, it may determine not to acquire an otherwise attractive asset.\nFor each asset that we acquire, our Manager's asset management team engages in active management of the asset, the intensity of which depends on the attendant risks. The asset manager works collaboratively with the underwriting team to formulate a strategic plan for the particular asset, which includes evaluating the underlying collateral and updating valuation assumptions to reflect changes in the real estate market and the general economy. This plan also generally outlines several strategies for the asset to extract the maximum amount of value from each asset under a variety of market conditions. Such strategies may vary depending on the type of asset, the availability of refinancing options, recourse and maturity, but may include, among others, the restructuring of non-performing or sub-performing loans, the negotiation of discounted pay-offs or other modification of the terms governing a loan, and the foreclosure and management of assets underlying non-performing loans in order to reposition them for profitable disposition. Our Manager and its affiliates will continuously track the progress of an asset against the original business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to own the asset do not outweigh the associated rewards. Under these circumstances, certain assets will require intensified asset management in order to achieve optimal value realization.\nOur Manager's asset management team engages in a proactive and comprehensive on-going review of the credit quality of each asset it manages. In particular for debt investments, on at least an annual basis, the asset management team will evaluate the financial wherewithal of individual borrowers to meet contractual obligations as well as review the financial stability of the assets securing such debt investments. Further, there is ongoing review of borrower covenant compliance including the ability of borrowers to meet certain negotiated debt service coverage ratios and debt yield tests. For equity investments, the asset management team, with the assistance of third party property managers, monitors and reviews key metrics such as occupancy, same store sales, tenant payment rates, property budgets and capital expenditures. If through this analysis of credit quality, the asset management team encounters declines in credit not in accord with the original business plan, the team evaluates the risks and determine what changes, if any, are required to the business plan to ensure that the attendant risks of continuing to hold the investment do not outweigh the associated rewards.\nIn addition, the audit committee of our board of directors, in consultation with management, periodically reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including key risks to which we are subject, including credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate. Substantially all of the leases at our multifamily and student housing properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our multifamily and student housing properties.\nRefer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nCertain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nWe consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest by first considering if an entity meets the definition of a VIE for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, or if we have the power to control an entity through a majority of voting interest or through other arrangements.\nVariable Interest Entities-A VIE is an entity that either (i) lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; (ii) whose equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest; or (iii) is established with non-substantive voting rights. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE through (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. We also consider interests held by our related parties, including de facto agents. We assess whether we are members of a related party group that collectively meets the power and benefits criteria and, if so, whether we are most closely associated with the VIE. In performing the related party analysis, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: the amount and characteristics of their investment relative to the related party; our ability and the related party's ability to control or significantly influence key decisions of the VIE including consideration of involvement by de facto agents; the obligation or likelihood for us or the related party to fund operating losses of the VIE; and the similarity and significance of the VIE's business to our activities and to those of the related party. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE, and whether we are the primary beneficiary, may involve significant judgment, including the determination of which activities most significantly affect the entities' performance, and estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of assets held by the VIE.\nVoting Interest Entities-Unlike VIEs, voting interest entities have sufficient equity to finance their activities and equity investors exhibit the characteristics of a controlling financial interest through their voting rights. We consolidate such entities when we have the power to control these entities through ownership of a majority of the entities' voting interests or through other arrangements.\nAt each reporting period, we reassess whether changes in facts and circumstances cause a change in the status of an entity as a VIE or voting interest entity, and/or a change in our consolidation assessment. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively. An entity may be consolidated as a result of this reassessment, in which case, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest in the entity are recorded at fair value upon initial consolidation. Any existing equity interest we hold in the entity prior to us obtaining control will be remeasured at fair value, which may result in a gain or loss recognized upon initial consolidation. However, if the consolidation represents an asset acquisition of a voting interest entity, our existing interest in the acquired assets, if any, is not remeasured to fair value but continues to be carried at historical cost. We may also deconsolidate a subsidiary as a result of this reassessment, which may result in a gain or loss recognized upon deconsolidation depending on the carrying values of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of any interests retained.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is based on an exit price, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to estimated fair values are made to appropriately reflect counterparty credit risk as well as our own credit-worthiness.\nThe estimated fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are categorized into a three-tier hierarchy, prioritized based on the level of transparency in inputs used in the valuation techniques, as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in non-active markets, or valuation techniques utilizing inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable data directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3-At least one assumption or input is unobservable and it is significant to the fair value measurement, requiring significant management judgment or estimate.\nWhere the inputs used to measure the fair value of a financial instrument fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the financial instrument is categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe evaluate each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business. If substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. If not, for an acquisition to be considered a business, it would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e., there is a continuation of revenue before and after the transaction). A substantive process is not ancillary or minor, cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay or is otherwise considered unique or scarce. To qualify as a business without outputs, the acquired assets would require an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to perform a substantive process.\nNet cash paid to acquire a business or assets is classified as investing activities on the accompanying statements of cash flows.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity, net of fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require significant estimates and assumptions.\nFor acquisitions that are not deemed to be businesses, the assets acquired are recognized based on their cost to us as the acquirer, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the carrying amount of the assets acquired. The cost of assets acquired in a group is allocated to individual assets within the group based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill. Transaction costs related to acquisition of assets are included in the cost basis of the assets acquired.\nThe acquisitions of NorthStar I and NorthStar II were each accounted for under the acquisition method for a business combination. See Note 3, Business Combinations\u201d, to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nLoans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment\nWe originate and purchase loans and preferred equity held for investment. The accounting framework for loans receivable depends on our strategy whether to hold or sell the loan, whether the loan was credit-impaired at the time of acquisition, or whether the lending arrangement is an Acquisition, Development and Construction ( ADC\u201d) loan.\nLoans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment\nLoans and preferred equity that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment. Originated loans and preferred equity are recorded at amortized cost, or outstanding unpaid principal balance plus exit fees less net deferred loan fees. Net deferred loan fees include unamortized origination and other fees charged to the borrower less direct incremental loan origination costs incurred by us. Purchased loans are recorded at amortized cost, or unpaid principal balance plus purchase premium or less unamortized discount. Costs to purchase loans and preferred equity are expensed as incurred.\nInterest Income-Interest income is recognized based upon contractual interest rate and unpaid principal balance of the loans. Net deferred loan fees on originated loans are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest income over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method. Premium or discount on purchased loans are amortized as adjustments to interest income over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method. For revolving loans, net deferred loan fees, premium or discount are amortized to interest income using the straight-line method. When a loan is prepaid, prepayment fees and any excess of proceeds over the carrying amount of the loan are recognized as additional interest income.\nNonaccrual-Accrual of interest income is suspended on nonaccrual loans and preferred equity investments. Loans and preferred equity that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, are generally considered nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual. Interest receivable is reversed against interest income when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collected is recognized on a cash basis by crediting income when received; or if ultimate collectability of loan and preferred equity principal is uncertain, interest collected is recognized using a cost recovery method by applying interest collected as a reduction to loan and preferred equity carrying value. Loans and preferred equity investments may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest are current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest are reasonably assured.\nImpairment and Allowance for Loan Losses-On a periodic basis, we analyze the extent and effect of any credit migration from underwriting and the initial investment review associated with the performance of a loan and preferred equity investment and/or value of its underlying collateral, financial and operating capability of the borrower or sponsor, as well as amount and status of any senior loan, where applicable. Specifically, operating results of collateral properties and any cash reserves are analyzed and\nused to assess whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover debt service requirements currently and into the future, ability of the borrower to refinance the loan or preferred equity investment, liquidation value of collateral properties, and financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors, as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the collateral properties. Such analysis is performed at least quarterly, or more often as needed when impairment indicators are present. During the year of 2018, we recorded a $113.9 million provision for loan loss. See Note 4, Loans and Preferred Equity Held for Investment, net\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nLoans and preferred equity investments are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with contractual terms of the loans and preferred equity investments, including consideration of underlying collateral value. Allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in loans and preferred equity held for investment at balance sheet date. Changes in allowance for loan and preferred equity losses are recorded in the provision for loan losses on the statement of operations. Allowance for loan losses generally exclude interest receivable as accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan or preferred equity investment is placed on nonaccrual status. Allowance for loan losses is generally measured as the difference between the carrying value of the loan or preferred equity investment and either the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan or preferred equity investment or an observable market price for the loan or preferred equity investment. Subsequent changes in impairment are recorded as adjustments to the provision for loan losses. Loans and preferred equity investments are charged off against allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. A loan or preferred equity investment is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan or preferred equity investment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and preferred equity investments are written down to the fair value of the collateral less disposal cost, first through a charge-off against allowance for loan losses, if any, then recorded as impairment loss.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring-A loan with contractual terms modified in a manner that grants concession to the borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a TDR. Concessions could include term extensions, payment deferrals, interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance, or other actions designed to maximize our collection on the loan. As a TDR is generally considered to be an impaired loan, it is measured for impairment based on our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans that we intend to sell or liquidate in the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value less disposal cost, with valuation changes recognized as impairment loss. Loans held for sale are not subject to allowance for loan losses. Net deferred loan origination fees and loan purchase premiums or discounts are deferred and capitalized as part of the carrying value of the held for sale loan until the loan is sold and are therefore included in the periodic valuation adjustments based on lower of cost or fair value less disposal cost.\nADC Arrangements\nWe provide loans to third party developers for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under an ADC arrangement, we participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or other use of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each ADC arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. ADC arrangements with characteristics implying loan classification are presented as loans held for investment and result in the recognition of interest income. ADC arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are presented as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and are accounted for using the equity method. The classification of each ADC arrangement as either loan receivable or real estate joint venture involves significant judgment and relies on various factors, including market conditions, amount and timing of expected residual profits, credit enhancements in the form of guaranties, estimated fair value of the collateral, and significance of borrower equity in the project, among others. The classification of ADC arrangements is performed at inception, and periodically reassessed when significant changes occur in the circumstances or conditions described above.\nOperating real estate\nReal estate acquisitions-Real estate acquired in acquisitions that are deemed to be business combinations is recorded at the fair values of the acquired components at the time of acquisition, allocated among land, buildings, improvements, equipment and lease-related tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including foregone leasing costs, in-place lease values and above-or below-market lease values. Real estate acquired in acquisitions that are deemed to be asset acquisitions is recorded at the total value of consideration transferred, including transaction costs, allocated to the acquired components based upon relative fair value. The estimated fair value of acquired land is derived from recent comparable sales of land and listings within the same local region based on available market data. The estimated fair value of acquired buildings and building improvements is derived from comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis using market-based assumptions, or replacement cost, as appropriate. The fair value of site and tenant improvements is estimated based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nReal estate held for investment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nCosts Capitalized or Expensed-Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while expenditures for significant renovations that improve or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation-Real estate held for investment, other than land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\n\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nImpairment-We evaluate our real estate held for investment for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate real estate for impairment generally on an individual property basis. If an impairment indicator exists, we evaluate the undiscounted future net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the property, including any estimated proceeds from the eventual disposition of the property. If multiple outcomes are under consideration, we may apply a probability-weighted approach to the impairment analysis. Based upon the analysis, if the carrying value of a property exceeds its undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property. In evaluating and/or measuring impairment, we consider, among other things, current and estimated future cash flows associated with each property, market information for each sub-market, including, where applicable, competition levels, foreclosure levels, leasing trends, occupancy trends, lease or room rates, and the market prices of similar properties recently sold or currently being offered for sale, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. Another key consideration in this assessment is our assumption about the highest and best use of our real estate investments and our intent and ability to hold them for a reasonable period that would allow for the recovery of their carrying values. If such assumptions change and we shorten its expected hold period, this may result in the recognition of impairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $31.8 million impairment loss on our operating real estate portfolio. See Note 7, Real Estate, net\u201d and Note 15, Fair Value,\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nReal estate held for sale\nClassification as held for sale-Real estate is classified as held for sale in the period when (i) management approves a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms, (iii) a program is initiated to locate a buyer and actively market the asset for sale at a reasonable price, and (iv) completion of the sale is probable within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal cost, with any write-down to fair value less disposal cost recorded as an impairment loss. For any increase in fair value less disposal cost subsequent to classification as held for sale, the impairment loss may be reversed, but only up to the amount of cumulative loss previously recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell the real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been continuously classified as held for investment, and (ii) its estimated fair value at the time we decide not to sell.\nReal estate sales-We evaluate if real estate sale transactions qualify for recognition under the full accrual method, considering whether, among other criteria, the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay, any receivable due to us is not subject to future subordination, we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold real estate. At the time the sale is consummated, a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between the sale price less disposal cost and the carrying value of the real estate.\nForeclosed properties\nWe receive foreclosed properties in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. Foreclosed properties are recognized, generally, at the time the real estate is received at foreclosure sale or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties are initially measured at fair value. Deficiencies compared to the carrying value of the loan, after reversing any previously recognized loss provision on the loan, are recorded as impairment loss. We periodically evaluate foreclosed properties for subsequent decrease in fair value, which is recorded as additional impairment loss. Fair value of foreclosed properties is generally based on third party appraisals, broker price opinions, comparable sales or a combination thereof.\nReal Estate Securities\nWe classify our CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. However, we have elected the fair value option for the assets and liabilities of our investments in securitization financing entities ( Investing VIEs\u201d), and as a result, any unrealized gains (losses) on the consolidated Investing VIEs are recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, we held subordinate tranches of three securitization trusts, which represent our retained interest in the securitization trusts, which we consolidate under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 6, Real Estate Securities, Available for Sale\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d for further detail.\nInterest Income-Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security. Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income.\nImpairment-CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) as any change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trust, net as losses occur.\nCRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly. Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses. The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow. The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any OTTI recorded on our CRE securities.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using one of (i) equity method where applicable; (ii) fair value option if elected; (iii) fair value through earnings if fair value is readily determinable, including election of NAV practical expedient where applicable; or (iv) for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the measurement alternative to measure at cost adjusted for any impairment and observable price changes, as applicable.\nFair value changes of equity method investments under the fair value option are recorded in earnings from investments in unconsolidated ventures. Fair value changes of other equity investments, including adjustments for observable price changes under the measurement alternative, are recorded in other gain (loss).\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments under the equity method of accounting if they have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an entity, but do not have a controlling financial interest. The equity method investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for capital contributions, distributions and our share of the entity's net income or loss as well as other comprehensive income or loss. Our share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in an entity if the governing documents prescribe a substantive non-proportionate earnings allocation formula or a preferred return to certain investors. For certain equity method investments, we record our proportionate share of income on a one to three month lag. Distributions of operating profits from equity method investments are reported as operating activities, while distributions in excess of operating profits while distributions in excess of operating profits are reported as investing activities in the statement of cash flows under the cumulative earnings approach.\nAt December 31, 2018, our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of investments in PE Investments, senior loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity held in joint ventures, as well as ADC loan arrangements accounted for as equity method investments. At December 31, 2017, our investments in unconsolidated ventures consisted of investments in PE Investments and ADC loan arrangements accounted for as equity method investments.\nImpairment\nEvaluation of impairment applies to equity method investments and equity investments under the measurement alternative. If indicators of impairment exist, we will first estimate the fair value of its investment. In assessing fair value, we generally consider, among others, the estimated enterprise value of the investee or fair value of the investee's underlying net assets, including net cash flows to be generated by the investee as applicable.\nFor investments under the measurement alternative, if carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, an impairment is deemed to have occurred.\nFor equity method investments, further consideration is made if a decrease in value of the investment is other-than-temporary to determine if impairment loss should be recognized. Assessment of other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") involves management judgment, including, but not limited to, consideration of the investee's financial condition, operating results, business prospects and creditworthiness, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery of its carrying value, or a significant and prolonged decline in traded price of the investee's equity security. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that we may not fully recover the carrying value of its investment, then the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.\nInvestments that are other-than-temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value. Impairment loss is recorded in earnings from investments in unconsolidated ventures for equity method investments and in other gain (loss) for investments under the measurement alternative.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nSale accounting for transfers of financial assets is limited to the transfer of an entire financial asset, a group of financial assets in their entirety, or a component of a financial asset that meets the definition of a participating interest by having characteristics that are similar to the original financial asset.\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. If we have any continuing involvement, rights or obligations with the transferred financial asset (outside of standard representations and warranties), sale accounting would require that the transfer meets the following conditions: (1) the transferred asset has been legally isolated; (2) the transferee has the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred asset; and (3) we do not maintain effective control over the transferred asset through an agreement that provides for (a) both an entitlement and an obligation by us to repurchase or redeem the asset before its maturity, (b) our unilateral ability to reclaim the asset and a more than trivial benefit attributable to that ability, or (c) the transferee requiring us to repurchase the asset at a price so favorable to the transferee that it is probable the repurchase will occur.\nIf the criteria for sale accounting are met, the transferred financial asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized upon sale, taking into account any retained interests. Transfers of financial assets that do not meet the criteria for sale are accounted for as financing transactions.\nRecent Accounting Updates\nRecent accounting updates are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Annual Report Form 10-K.", "item_7_tables": "Table 248: <table><tr><td> </td>
