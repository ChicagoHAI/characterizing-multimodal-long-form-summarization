Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\u201d and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs, assumptions, and information currently available to our management, and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, those described in greater detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company focused on enabling our clients to fundamentally change the diagnosis, treatment and pharmacoeconomics of cancer and other critical illnesses. We believe a molecular-driven, systems-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on large-scale, real time biometric and phenotypical data will become the standard of care initially for patients with cancer and, ultimately, other critical illnesses. We derive revenue from selling GPS Cancer (our Genomic Proteomic Spectrometry Cancer test, a unique, comprehensive molecular test and decision support solution that measures the proteins present in the patient's tumor tissue, combined with whole genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of tumor & normal samples), to which we obtained exclusive access from an affiliate, and NantOS and NantOS apps to healthcare providers and payors, self-insured employers and biopharmaceutical companies. NantOS and NantOS apps include proprietary methods and algorithms for enabling healthcare providers to make better treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes and lower the cost of care, and allow healthcare payors to ensure that their dependents receive high quality care in a cost-effective manner. We believe that as healthcare providers and payors migrate to value-based reimbursement models and implement advances in precision medicine, our offerings position us at the forefront of multiple significant market opportunities.\nWe market NantHealth solutions (which was originally introduced to the market as CLINICS) as a comprehensive integrated solution that includes GPS Cancer, NantOS and the NantOS apps. We also market our GPS Cancer, NantOS, individual NantOS apps and suites of NantOS apps as stand-alone solutions. To accelerate our commercial growth and enhance our competitive advantage, we continue to:\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>introduce new marketing, education and engagement efforts and foster relationships across the oncology community to drive adoption of GPS Cancer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pursue reimbursement of GPS Cancer from regional and national third-party payors and government payors and self-insured employers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>publish scientific and medical advances;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>strengthen our commercial organization to increase our NantHealth solutions client base and to broaden usage of our solutions by existing clients who currently use only NantOS, specific NantOS apps or suites of NantOS apps; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>develop new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions to address the needs of current and future healthcare provider and payor, self-insured employer and biopharmaceutical company clients.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of NantHealth solutions, including NantOS and the NantOS apps, as well as the commercial launch of our GPS Cancer business. To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and as of December 31, 2016 our accumulated deficit was approximately $475.3 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses over the near term as we drive adoption of GPS Cancer, expand our commercial operations, and invest further in NantHealth solutions.\n- 98 -\nWe plan to (i) continue investing in our infrastructure, including but not limited to solution development, sales and marketing, implementation and support, (ii) continue efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline, (iii) add new clients through maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and solution development activities, (iv) expand our relationships with existing clients through delivery of add-on and complementary solutions and services and (v) continue our commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs. We believe that our growing client base using our NantOS and NantOS apps on a daily basis is a strategic asset, and we intend to expand sales of NantHealth solutions offerings towards this client base in order to leverage this strategic asset.\nRecent Developments\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed our IPO, whereby we sold 6,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. Additionally, on June 9, 2016, the underwriters partially exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional 400,000 shares of our common stock at $14.00 per share.\nWe received a total of $83.6 million in net proceeds from our IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $13.0 million. The offering was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-211196), as amended.\nIn December 2016, we issued convertible notes to a related party and others for net proceeds of $9.9 million and $92.8 million, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $4.2 million. Please see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these convertible notes.\nRecent Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have made several significant acquisitions and investments in 2014, 2015 and 2016, which have expanded the features and functionality of NantHealth solutions, including the following:\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NDO In June 2014, we acquired NDO, which provides healthcare interoperability and informatics solutions through its cOS platform to address population health issues. Our results of operations include the impact of the NDO acquisition as of June 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NantOmics In June 2015, we invested a substantial portion of our available capital in NantOmics, a majority owned subsidiary of NantWorks. Our investment represents approximately 14.3% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of NantOmics. Our relationship with NantOmics provides us with access to what we believe is the nation's only CAP- and CLIA-certified whole genome and quantitative proteomics laboratory.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Healthcare Solutions ( HCS\u201d) In July 2015, we acquired certain assets related to HCS business from Harris Corporation. We believe the acquired assets will help complex healthcare delivery organizations achieve better patient outcomes, clinical and administrative workflow efficiency and stronger collaboration across the continuum of care.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NaviNet In January 2016, we acquired NaviNet, which provides a secure collaboration network connecting approximately 36 health plans and which is estimated to be utilized in more than 70% of the nation's physicians' offices during the fourth quarter of 2016. NaviNet Open will serve as a nationwide scalable and secure web-based portal for patients and providers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share\nAdjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Our management believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance, because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for our core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for our core business between current, past and future periods . Other companies may define these measures in different ways. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All loss per share numbers contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated based on one class of common stock and do not incorporate the effects, if any, of using the two-class method.\n- 99 -\nAdjusted net loss excludes the effects of (1) loss from equity method investments, (2) stock based compensation expense, (3) intangible amortization, (4) corporate restructuring expenses, (5) BP settlement other income, (6) acquisition related compensation expense, (7) acquisition-related sales incentives, which have been recorded as contra revenue, (8) change in fair value of derivatives liability, (9) non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, and (10) Benefit for (provision from) income taxes adjustment includes the impact of the conversion from a limited liability corporation to a corporation, the impact of convertible notes offering and the impact of intangibles amortization.\nAdjusted shares outstanding include Series F redeemable shares as if converted on January 1, 2014.\nThe following table reconciles Net loss to Net loss per share -

Our Systems Infrastructure and platforms support the delivery of both personalized comprehensive sequencing and molecular analysis and the implementation of value-based care models across the healthcare continuum. We generate revenue from the following sources:\n- 101 -\nSoftware, middleware and hardware - Software, middleware and hardware revenue is generated from the sale of NantOS and NantOS apps software on either a perpetual or term license basis, and the sale of our hardware. The software is installed on the client's site or the client's designated vendor's site and is not hosted by us or by a vendor contracted by us. We also generate revenue from the resale of third-party software and hardware to our clients. Our software and hardware solutions sold include components of our NantOS, including FusionFX, cOS, DeviceConX and HBox.\nSoftware-as-a-service - Software-as-a-service, or SaaS, revenue is generated from our clients' access to and usage of our hosted software solutions on a subscription basis for a specified contract term, which is typically annually. In our SaaS arrangements, the client cannot take possession of the software during the term of the contract and generally only has the right to access and use the software and receive any software upgrades published during the subscription period. Solutions sold under a SaaS model include our eviti platform solutions,NantOS and NantOS apps. SaaS revenue may include hosting of our software solutions on behalf of the client.\nMaintenance - Maintenance revenue includes ongoing post-contract client support, or PCS, or maintenance during the paid PCS term. Additionally, PCS includes ongoing development of software updates and upgrades provided to the client on a when and if available basis. We sell NantOS, including DeviceConX and FusionFX, with maintenance contracts.\nSequencing and molecular analysis - Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue is generated by the process of performing sequencing and analysis of whole genome DNA, RNA and proteomic results, including GPS Cancer. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of the analysis and reporting of the results to the client or on a cash basis when it cannot conclude that the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nOther services - Other services revenue includes revenue from professional services we provide that are generally complementary to our software solutions and may or may not be required for the solution to function as desired by the client. When associated with software, there services are generally provided in the form of training and implementation services during the software license period and do not include PCS. Other services revenue also includes revenue related to nursing and therapy services provided to patients in a home care setting and any other services not included in the preceding revenue sources.\nWe have established VSOE for PCS on certain of our software solutions. We have not yet established VSOE of fair value for any element other than PCS for a portion of our arrangements. In situations where VSOE of fair value exists for PCS but not a delivered element, the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the undelivered element equal to our VSOE value with the remainder allocated to the delivered elements. In situations where our services are essential to the functionality of our software and VSOE of fair value for PCS does not exist, we defer revenue and costs until we have delivered all elements of the arrangement and amortize revenue and costs over the initial PCS period. For our contracts with multiple elements, we defer revenue until only one undelivered element remains and then recognize the revenue following the pattern of delivery of the final undelivered element. The timing and pattern of this revenue recognition can cause variations in revenue from period-to-period.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs for associates providing services to our clients and supporting our revenue-generating platform infrastructure, including salaries, benefits and bonuses. Additional expenses include consultant costs, direct reimbursable travel expenses and other direct engagement costs associated with the design, development, sale and installation of our solutions, including system support and maintenance services. Our cost of revenue associated with each of our revenue sources is as follows:\nTable 320: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>Software, middleware and hardware - Software and hardware cost of revenue includes third-party software and hardware costs directly associated with our solutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>Software-as-a-service - SaaS cost of revenue includes personnel-related, amortization of deferred implementation costs and other direct costs associated with the delivery and hosting of NantOS and NantOS apps, including eviti, our cancer-decision support solution, and NaviNet on a subscription basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>Maintenance - Maintenance cost of revenue includes personnel-related and other direct costs associated with the ongoing support or maintenance we provide for our clients.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>Sequencing and molecular analysis - Sequencing and molecular analysis cost of revenue includes internal costs associated with these services and amounts due to NantOmics under our Reseller Agreement for the sequencing and analysis of whole genome, DNA, RNA and proteomic results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 102 -\nTable 324: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>Other services - Other services cost of revenue includes personnel-related costs, amortization of deferred implementation costs and other direct costs associated with software training and implementation services provided to our clients as well as direct expenses relating to our nursing and therapy services provided to patients in a home care setting.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of revenue also includes amortization of our developed technologies used to generate revenue. We plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. We expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we expand NantHealth solutions and realize economies of scale.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative, research and development, and amortization of software license and acquisition-related assets.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of shared service fees from NantWorks, personnel-related expenses for our sales and marketing, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative associates, stock based compensation, and advertising and marketing promotions of NantHealth solutions. It also includes trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, point of purchase display expenses and related amortization as well as legal costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate and administrative costs.\nWith the exception of stock based compensation, we expect our selling, general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to attract new clients, broaden usage of our solutions by existing clients, and expand our brand. Additionally, we expect to incur additional costs for legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with operating as a public company. These increases include additional costs we expect to incur associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies as well as increased costs for directors' and officers' liability insurance and an enhanced investor relations function. However, we expect our selling, general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as our revenue increases and we realize economies of scale.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for associates working on development of solutions, including salaries, benefits and stock based compensation. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees to third-party development resources.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new software solutions and improving our existing software solutions. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred as the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of software solutions for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWith the exception of stock based compensation, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the short term as we continue to make significant investments in developing new solutions and enhancing the functionality of our existing solutions. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we realize economies of scale from our developed technology.\nAmortization of Software License and Acquisition Related Assets\nAmortization of software license and acquisition related assets consists of non-cash amortization expense related to our non-revenue generating technology as well as amortization expense that we recognize on intangible assets that we acquired through our investments.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net primarily consists of interest expense associated with our outstanding borrowings offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n- 103 -\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of unrealized and realized gains (losses) on and dividends received from our marketable securities and other non-recurring items.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Method Investments\nIncome (Loss) from equity method investments consists of our pro rata share of income and losses of a company that we own an ownership interest in and account for under the equity method of accounting.\nWe regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other than temporary impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state and foreign income taxes. To date, we have no significant U.S. federal, state and foreign cash income taxes because of our LLC status prior to June 1, 2016 and current and accumulated net operating losses.\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all the available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\n- 104 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 325: <table><tr><td> </td>

2016\nTotal revenue increased $42.1 million or 72.2% from $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our total revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and from our acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016. Our acquisition of certain assets of HCS resulted in the contribution of $19.2 million in primarily maintenance, SaaS, and other services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to approximately $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our acquisition of NaviNet resulted in the contribution of $40.8 million mainly in SaaS revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe that a significant opportunity exists to expand sequencing and molecular analysis revenue as we expand both the number of GPS profiles delivered as well as obtaining additional insurance reimbursement for our GPS profile.\nTotal software-related revenue was $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $31.3 million or 88.4%. Our total software-related revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and from the acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016. We also experienced growth in our Nant OS cancer decision support revenue from expansion in our customer base for those products. These increases were partially offset by a $11.6 million decrease in software and hardware revenue recognized from completed implementations of our DeviceConX, as well as decreases in our NantOS Interoperability (formerly cOS) platforms compared to the same period in the prior year. Software related revenue in the prior year ended December 31, 2015 included recognition of revenue from certain large DeviceConX arrangements which had been previously deferred pending completion of implementation.\nSoftware and hardware revenue decreased $6.4 million or 43.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to a decreased amount of completed DeviceConX implementations. Software and hardware revenue attributed to NantOS DeviceConX is recognized upon the completion of each implementation. A decline of $7.2 million was attributable to a reduction in the number of completed large implementations during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease was offset by a $1.0 million incremental increase as a result of the HCS acquisition. In 2015, there were more projects in excess of $1.0 million dollars in contract value completed compared with to 2016. We believe opportunities exist to grow software and hardware revenue through completion of both existing implementations as well as executing new sales bookings from our pipeline of opportunities.\nSaaS revenue was $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $37.6 million or 181.5% from $20.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by increased NantOS revenue including $1.0 million of FusionFX revenue acquired with the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and revenue of $41.0 million from the acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016 in connection with SaaS revenue. In addition, revenue from our NantOS cancer decision support (formerly Eviti) platform solutions increased $1.5 million, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in revenue from other NantOS Interoperability platforms.\nMaintenance revenue increased $3.8 million or 36.2% from $10.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015. Acquired NantOS (formerly Harris HCS) maintenance customers contributed to an increase of $3.9 million in maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n- 107 -\nSequencing and molecular analysis revenue during the period included revenue recognized for GPS profiles for which fees are fixed and determinable under a payor agreement as well as what was recognized on a cash basis due to uncertainty over reimbursement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $0.6 million in sequencing and molecular analysis revenue. There are significant opportunities going forward as we gain momentum in gaining coverage in the US with commercial health plans and self-insured employers and globally with supplemental benefits insurers, while at the same time building GPS adoption among oncologists, including the community and academic institutions.\nWe are aggressively expanding our sales efforts by adding seasoned sales and account management professionals in 2017. The commercial team's efforts are focused around the development of pilots with commercial insurance payers who would agree to pay for a certain number of GPS profiles, aligned with designated provider groups who will order the GPS test, and reimbursement is recognized. The pipeline of pilot opportunities going into 2017 is in excess of $10.0 million dollars. Our pipeline of self-insured employers includes opportunities with many companies listed on Fortune's 100, as well as an alliance of 50 of the largest employers in the US. Most recently, we announced a partnership with the International Association of Firefighters, which is significant not only because of its size, but because its incidence of cancer is much greater than the average population, and in 37 states, there are presumptive laws around job related cancer for firefighters, which has opened discussions for us related to worker's compensation as well.\nOther services revenue increased $6.5 million or 52.4% from $12.4 million in 2015 to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily driven by the completion of a large NantOS Interoperability (formerly Harris HCS) software related services project which contributed to NantOS interoperability services revenue growth of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and incremental growth of $0.2 million from the NaviNet acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease of NantOS DeviceConX solutions due to a decline in the number of completed large projects.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-sell opportunities of our suite of solutions across our existing customer base, including the recently acquired HCS FusionFX and NaviNet customer bases. We are also integrating the cOS, FusionFX and NaviNet product solutions, within our NantOS platform, and believe that opportunities exist to cross-sell this combination of solutions to existing former HCS, FusionFX and NaviNet customers as well as to new customers. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS sequencing analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future maintenance and SaaS recurring revenue streams.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nTotal revenue increased $24.4 million, or 71.9%, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our total revenue growth came in all of our revenue categories and was driven primarily by growth in our existing solutions including NantOS (DeviceConX and cOS), eviti and sequencing and molecular analysis, as well as our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015. Our acquisition of certain assets of HCS resulted in the contribution of $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.9 million in SaaS, maintenance and other services revenue, respectively, for the year ended 2015.\nOur total software-related revenue (including software, hardware, and SaaS) increased to $35.4 million for 2015 from $18.2 million for 2014, an increase of $17.2 million, or 94.8%. This growth came primarily from growth in revenue from our NantOS (DeviceConX and cOS) and eviti solutions, as well as our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015.\nSoftware and hardware revenue increased to $14.6 million for 2015 from $8.4 million for the year ended 2014, an increase of $6.2 million, or 74.6%. This growth was primarily driven by an increased amount of completed NantOS component DeviceConX implementations. Software and hardware revenue attributed to DeviceConX is recognized upon the completion of each implementation.\nSaaS revenue increased to $20.7 million for 2015 from $9.8 million for the year ended 2014, an increase of $11.0 million, or 112.0%. This increase was primarily driven by increased NantOS sales (including our Fusion family of products, or Fusion), revenue acquired with the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and eviti platform revenue. eviti platform revenue grew to approximately $13.9 million for 2015 from $8.9 million for 2014, an increase of $5.0 million, or 56%. eviti revenue growth was primarily driven by an expansion in volume with our existing payor customer base. cOS revenue included under SaaS was positively impacted by the recognition of $4.7 million in previously deferred revenue related to a client arrangement which ended in 2015. Finally, we recognized approximately $0.9 million in acquired Fusion SaaS revenue for 2015.\nMaintenance revenue increased to $10.5 million for 2015 from $5.3 million for 2014, an increase of $5.1 million, or 95.5%. Maintenance revenue growth was primarily driven by both an increase in customer base of DeviceConX as a result of completed implementations as well as acquired Fusion maintenance customers which contributed approximately $1.1 million in maintenance revenue for 2015.\n- 108 -\nThe increase in other services revenue of $2.0 million for December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by both the increase in the number of completed DeviceConX implementations as well as higher volume in our home healthcare business, or Assisteo. Our Assisteo home healthcare business benefited from an expanded relationship with a skilled nursing facility in 2015.\nWe expected to launch our commercial sequencing and molecular analysis solution, or GPS Cancer, in the second quarter of 2016. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement to provide certain research related sequencing services to a research institution. The agreement provides that the institution pay us $10.0 million in exchange for our providing sequencing services through our reseller agreement with NantOmics. In 2015, we provided $6.2 million of services, which has been recorded as a deemed capital contribution instead of revenue. At the institution's request, certain non-profit organizations provided partial funding for the sequencing and related bioinformatics costs associated with the project. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a member of the board of directors of, and may have significant influence or control over, these organizations. The institution was not contractually or otherwise required to use our molecular profiling solution or any of our other products or services as part of the charitable gift. In 2016, we completed another $3.8 million in services, which was recorded as deemed capital contributions.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-sell opportunities of our suite of solutions across our existing customer base including the recently acquired HCS and Fusion customer bases. We are also integrating the cOS, Fusion and NaviNet and believe that opportunities exist to cross sell this to existing Fusion and NaviNet customers as well as to new customers. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS sequencing analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future maintenance and SaaS recurring revenue streams.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,937.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-91.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software-as-a-service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-12.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total software-related cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,942\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-21.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sequencing and molecular analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,994.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of developed technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nCost of revenue increased $37.5 million, or 107.8% from $34.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenue increased across all categories primarily as a result of acquisitions of HCS and NaviNet ($22.9 million). Additionally, we incurred $8.4 million of stock compensation expenses in the year period ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero in 2015.\nTotal software-related cost of revenue increased $19.4 million or 273.4% from $7.1 million in 2015 to $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers were the acquisitions of HCS and NaviNet which contributed increases of $0.7 million and $13.9 million respectively. Additionally, the Company has incurred $4.5 million of stock compensation expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016 versus zero in the same period last year.\nSequencing and molecular analysis increased $1.9 million or 4,994.9% from $0.04 million in 2015 compared to $2.0 million in 2016. We record the cost of revenue expense upon delivery of the GPS report to our clients. As a result, there will be a timing difference between the revenue recorded and the cost of revenue recorded. In addition, the cost of revenue is recorded as defined by the applicable contract with our clients and as outlined in the amended and restated Reseller Agreement for genomic and proteomic sequencing services and related bioinformatics and analysis services with NantOmics.\n- 109 -\nWe believe that there are significant opportunities going forward to grow the volume of sequencing and molecular analysis activity which would increase the associated costs of delivering such revenue. We record the cost of revenue expense upon delivery of the GPS report to our clients. There may be a timing difference between the revenue recorded and the cost of revenue recorded in the event that revenue recognition is delayed. Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue in the current period was limited to what could be recognized on a cash basis due to uncertainty over reimbursement for the GPS profiles delivered in the period. As we gain additional insurance coverage and reimbursement experience, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of GPS revenue which is recognized on a cash basis.\nOther services cost of revenue increased $10.3 million or 67.5% from $15.2 million in 2015 to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers were an incremental increase of $8.0 million as a result of the acquisition of HCS as well as an increase of $4.4 million in our NantOS Interoperability and Home Health Services lines of businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in cost of revenue associated with sequencing services provided to a research institution, as well as a decrease of $0.7 million in DeviceConX solutions due to a decline in the number of completed large projects.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nTotal cost of revenue increased $10.6 million, or 43.7%, from $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of an $8.2 million increase in our other services cost of revenue and a $2.9 million increase in our amortization of developed technologies, compared to 2014. The increase in total cost of revenue was partially offset by a decline in costs for software-related revenue of $1.9 million.\nThe $8.2 million increase in other services cost of revenue referenced above was primarily due to $3.7 million in amounts owed to NantOmics related to sequencing and molecular analysis performed for a research institution, incremental costs associated with the newly-acquired Fusion product revenue, and costs related to business expansion of our home health business for the year ended 2015. The increase in the amortization of developed technologies cost of revenue is due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition of HCS and full calendar year of amortization in 2015 versus a partial year of amortization in 2014 for the acquisition of NDO.\nThe $1.9 million reduction in total software-related cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a reduction in costs associated with certain cOS projects in 2015 versus 2014 as well as a reduction in certain hardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million or 74.8% from $69.0 million in 2015 to $120.7 million in 2016.

The increase was primarily driven by $4.7 million of expense related to the HCS acquisition in July 2015, and a $2.1 million increase due to higher headcount and associated personnel-related expenses as we invested in the development of our software and hardware solutions.\nInterest Expense, Net\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,340\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(980\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>911.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2016, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $107 million of our 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the \"Convertible Notes\") in a private placement offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, of which $10 million were issued to related party. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2021 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes. Please see the section entitled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the Convertible Notes.\n- 111 -\nIn January 2016, we executed a demand promissory note with NantCapital (the \"NantCapital Note\"), a personal investment vehicle for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a promissory note with NantOmics (the \"NantOmics Note\"). Through December 31, 2016, the total advances made by NantCapital and NantOmics to us pursuant to each applicable note amounted to approximately $112.7 million and $40.0 million, respectively. We can request additional advances subject to NantCapital and NantOmics approval. Each note bears interest at a per annum rate of 5.0% compounded annually and computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the year.\nIn May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. On December 15, 2016, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated May 9, 2016, between us and NantCapital, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note to June 30, 2022 and to subordinate the Promissory Note in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. In addition, in May 2016, the NantOmics Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest would be converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price at the time of pricing of the IPO. Later in May 2016, the NantOmics Note was further amended and restated to remove the automatic conversion feature and to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. In June 2016, the NantOmics Note was further amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest will be converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price after the pricing of the IPO and after the LLC Conversion. The NantOmics Note and all related accrued interest was converted on June 1, 2016 into 2,899,297 shares of our common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, there were no unpaid amounts related to the advances on the NantOmics Note. Please see the section entitled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 19 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these notes.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nInterest expense, net, increased by $5.7 million, from $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in interest expense, net, was due to the accrual of interest under the Convertible Notes, the NantOmics Note and the NantCapital Note.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nInterest expense, net decreased $0.4 million, or 36.0%, from $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the repayment of related party promissory notes on June 30, 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(477\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(586\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-23.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-625.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nOther income (expense), net, decreased by $0.6 million, from $2.5 million other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.9 million other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the year ended December 31, 2015, other income of $2.5 million was primarily derived from the dividend income and fair value adjustment from marketable securities. These marketable securities were liquidated or transferred to fund acquisitions and business operations. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we wrote off a short term note of $0.5 million with a vendor. There were no comparable write offs during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining balance was primarily due to expenses related to currency fluctuations.\n- 112 -\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a reduction in fair value of derivatives liability of $1.2 million, related to the convertible notes interest make-whole issued in December 2016. Also in November 2016, as one of the claimants in a class action lawsuit against BP p.l.c., and its related entities ( BP\u201d) regarding the Deepwater Horizon Incident, we entered into a settlement agreement with B.P. Exploration & Production, Inc. whereby in exchange for a $1.0 million monetary settlement we released BP from claims relating to the Deepwater Horizon Incident. In January 2017, the final distribution sheet was received and executed from BP's counsel in Alabama including information related to the gross $1.0 million settlement amount mentioned above and total $0.2 million expenses incurred related to the settlement agreement, resulting in a net settlement receivable of $0.8 million booked as Other income on our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nOther income (expense), net increased $3.0 million, from expense of $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to income of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This change was primarily attributable to the $2.3 million of dividend and interest income received from our marketable securities, $0.5 million from the write-off of short term notes payable and $0.2 million reimbursement from NantWorks for services provided by NantHealth associates in 2015.\nIncome (Loss) from Related Party Equity Method Investments\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from related party equity method Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,486.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(269.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from equity method investments increased $38.4 million compared with the same period of the prior year, from 2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $41.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our loss from equity investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $29.8 million non-cash impairment charge as a result of our determination that the fair value of our investment in NantOmics had declined below our carrying value as of December 31, 2016, and that this decline in value was other than temporary. The decline in the fair value of our investment in NantOmics was primarily caused by a change in the risk profile of our financial projections for NantOmics resulting from the delay in our GPS revenue growth.\nThe increase in loss from equity method investments was due to the impairment mentioned above, our pro rata share of losses from our investment in NantOmics, and the amortization of the basis difference in the investment. We report our share of NantOmics' loss and the amortization of basis difference using a one quarter lag.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments decreased $4.1 million, from income of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to a loss of $2.6 million during the year December 31, 2015. In 2014, we had income primarily attributable to an increase in our pro rata share of income from our investment in NantPharma LLC, or NantPharma, of $1.7 million. We sold our interest in NantPharma during May 2014. In 2015, we recorded pro rata share of losses from our investment in NantOmics.\n- 113 -\nProvision for (Benefits from) Income taxes\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,811\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,732.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,000.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the benefit from income taxes was $22.8 million, compared with a $0.4 million provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a benefit from income taxes in the amount of $8.7 million arising from a deferred tax asset valuation allowance release due to the LLC conversion to a C corporation and forming a federal tax consolidated group. The deferred tax liability previously recorded in purchase accounting of NaviNet became a source of income for the valuation allowance release.\nWe also recorded in 2016 an income tax benefit in the amount of $8.6 million, arising from the recording of a deferred tax expense in additional paid in capital due to the convertible notes conversion option recorded to equity. The remaining income tax benefit mainly results from amortization of purchase accounting intangibles.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the provision for income taxes was $0.4 million, compared to $0.01 million income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $160.4 million, compared to $7.2 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $3.0 million and $0.6 million , respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and our ability to borrow from affiliated entities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity, through one or more follow-on public offerings or in separate financings, or sell additional debt securities or obtain a credit facility. Further, because of the risk and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of our existing products as well as products in development, we may need additional funds to meet our needs sooner than planned. To date, our primary sources of capital were private placements of preferred stock, debt financing agreements, including the NantCapital Note, our IPO and the Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (\"the Convertible Notes\").\nConvertible Notes\nIn December 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Jefferies LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers\u201d), to issue and sell $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In December 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Cambridge Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Cambridge Equities, L.P., an entity affiliated with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ( Cambridge\u201d), to issue and sell $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In December 2016, pursuant to the exercise of the overallotment by the Initial Purchasers, we issued an additional $7.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately $102.7 million, comprised of $9.9 million from Cambridge and $92.8 million from the Initial Purchasers, after deducting of Initial Purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs of $4.3 million in connection with the Convertible Notes offering.\n- 114 -\nOn December 21, 2016, we entered into an Indenture, relating to the issuance of the Convertible Notes (the Indenture\u201d), by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee\u201d). The interest rates are fixed at 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2021, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted pursuant to their terms. The initial conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is 82.3893 shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $12.14 per share). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2021, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, the last reported sale price of our common stock on such trading day is greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price on such trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which, for each day of that period, the trading price per $1 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes will be settled in cash, shares of the Company's common stock or any combination thereof at our option.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes in principal amounts of $1 thousand or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nNantCapital Note\nIn January 2016, we issued the NantCapital Note to NantCapital, a personal investment vehicle for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and CEO, and the NantOmics Note to NantOmics. As of March 31, 2016, the total advances made by NantCapital and NantOmics to us pursuant to each applicable note were approximately $112.7 million and $40.0 million, respectively. In May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. In May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. On December 15, 2016, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated May 9, 2016, between us and NantCapital, to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note and to subordinate the Promissory Note in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. We can request additional advances subject to NantCapital approval, and the NantCapital Note bears interest at a per annum rate of 5.0% compounded annually and computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the year. NantCapital has the option, but not the obligation, to require us to repay any such amount in cash, Series A-2 units of NantOmics (based on a per unit price of $1.484) held by us, shares of our common stock based on a per share price of $18.6126 (if such equity exists at the time of repayment), or any combination of the foregoing at the sole discretion of NantCapital.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity, our stockholders could experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marketing of our products and scale back our business and operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated:\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70,634\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95,262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(230,077\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 115 -\nTo date, our operations have been primarily financed through the proceeds from related party promissory notes and through equity issuances, including net cash proceeds from our IPO and net cash proceeds from our Convertible Notes private placement. In June 2016, we sold 6,900,000 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share, which includes 400,000 shares sold to the underwriter upon exercise of their overallotment option to purchase additional shares of our Company. We raised net proceeds of $83.6 million from our IPO, after underwriting fees, discounts and commissions of $4.9 million and other offering costs of $8.1 million. In December 2016 we issued Convertible Notes to related party and others for net proceeds of $102.7 million, $9.9 million from Cambridge and $92.8 million from others, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $4.3 million.\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities have been driven by rate of revenue, billings, and collections, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, and enhancements to existing services, and the timing of general and administrative expenses as we grow our administrative infrastructure, and the continuing market acceptance of our solution. In addition, our net loss in the year ended December 31, 2016 has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of substantial non-cash charges.\nCash used in operating activities of $70.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of our continued significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and increased expenses incurred as we became a public company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, and other expenses incurred to grow our business. In the year ended December 31, 2016, $102.6 million, or 56% of our net loss of $184.1 million consisted of non-cash items, including a $54.0 million in stock-based compensation, $30.9 million of depreciation and amortization, a $41.0 million equity in net loss of a related party investment, a $0.5 million provision for accounts receivable bad debts, a $0.5 million inventory provision, and other non-cash expenses of $0.1 million. The non-cash expenses were partially offset by non-cash income related to a deferred income tax benefit of $23.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $6.0 million increase in deferred implementation costs due to an increase in business activity associated with the growth of our business, $5.6 million in payments to vendors, and a $0.3 million increase in related party receivables, net. The cash used in operating activities was offset by a $8.1 million decrease in accounts receivable, net attributable to the receipt of payments from our clients, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.5 million, a $3.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased billings during the year ended December 31, 2016, a $3.8 million increase in accrued expenses, and an increase in $4.2 million in related party payables, net.\nCash used in operating activities of $74.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of spending on selling, administrative structure, and research and development efforts. In the year ended December 31, 2015, $20.4 million, or 28%, of our net loss of $72.0 million consisted of non-cash items, including $15.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation, and $0.3 million of changes in fair value of marketable securities. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 included a $21.2 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.7 million decrease in related party payables, net, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $4.2 million increase in deferred implementation costs, which were partially offset by an increase of $7.2 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $3.6 million decrease in accounts receivable, net and, a decrease of $1.0 million in inventory, and a decrease of $0.2 million in related party receivables, net.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in operating activities of $42.1 million consisted of a net loss of $84.6 million, primarily attributable to an increase in spending on selling, general and administrative expense and research and development efforts, and $1.0 million of cash used to fund changes in working capital, partially offset by $43.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in related party payables of $7.6 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $1.6 million offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of $4.6 million, a decrease in other liabilities of $2.9 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.9 million, an decrease in inventory of $2.3 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.5 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $24.2 million of intangible assets impairment as we realized a non-cash charge for the impairment of certain of our acquired intangible assets, $16.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.7 million of unrealized changes in fair value of our marketable securities, and $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions to expand our features and functionality of NantHealth solutions and capital expenditures to develop our software as well as to purchase computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure.\n- 116 -\nWe used $88.8 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily comprised of $78.7 million related to our acquisition of NaviNet, $15.8 million of purchases of equipment and investments in our capitalized software, partially offset by consideration received related to acquisitions of $4.4 million, proceeds from sale of marketable securities of $1.3 million and proceeds from sale of equipment of $0.1 million.\nWe used $95.3 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily comprised of investments in NantOmics of $150.8 million, acquisition of HCS of $48.1 million, investments in our capitalized software and purchase of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures of approximately $8.2 million, purchase of intangible asset of $5.0 million, and $1.8 million purchase of IOBS, partially offset by the proceeds of the sale of the marketable securities for $136.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $230.1 million, which primarily consisted of investments in marketable securities of $251.7 million as we invested our cash raised in mutual funds, purchase of intangible asset of $4.0 million, investment in unconsolidated related parties of $3.3 million, $7.6 million in capital expenditures and $2.3 million in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses. These were offset in part by $26.1 million in proceeds from sales of our marketable securities as we liquidated our investments as needed to provide for working capital and $12.8 million from the sale of businesses and equity method investments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $313.6 million was primarily due to $152.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of related party promissory notes, $83.6 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, as well as $9.9 million and $92.8 million, respectively of proceeds from the sale of convertible notes to a related party and others, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In addition, cash provided by financing activities was also due to $3.8 million in deemed capital contribution from our Chairman and CEO. These proceeds were partially offset by $23.3 million of reductions in notes payable related to the NaviNet acquisition, and $5.8 million payment to tax authorities on the employee's behalf to satisfy withholding requirements on income earned from vested shares.\nCash provided by financing activities of $171.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to $200.0 million in proceeds from an issuance of equity interests to Allscripts in addition to deemed capital contribution from our Chairman and CEO of $6.2 million. These proceeds were partially offset by $34.5 million payments of related party promissory notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities of $258.8 million consisted of $260.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of membership interests and $5.9 million in proceeds from related party promissory note offset in part by a $2.0 million in payments of notes payable.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt obligations, non-cancellable leases for our office space and certain equipment and vendor contracts to provide research services, and purchase obligations under license agreements and reseller agreements. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 in thousands:\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchasing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party promissory note\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party convertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other convertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases and capital leases obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Including capital lease obligation in an amount of $89 thousand for payment prior to one year subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nIn September 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Reseller Agreement, (\"Reseller Agreement\"), for genomic and proteomic sequencing services and related bioinformatics and analysis services with NantOmics, with an effective date of June\n- 117 -\n19, 2015. The Reseller Agreement has a contract period from June 2015 through December 31, 2020, subject to three potential three-year renewal options if we meet certain GPS Cancer thresholds. We agreed to pay NantOmics non-cancellable annual minimum fees of $2.0 million for each of the calendar years from 2016 through 2020, and subject to us exercising at least one of our renewal options, we are required to pay annual minimum fees to NantOmics of $25.0 million for each of the calendar years from 2021 through 2023 and $50.0 million per year for each of the calendar years from 2024 through 2029. We have the ability to terminate this agreement without cause. The Reseller Agreement permits us to use vendors other than NantOmics to provide any or all of the services that are currently being provided by NantOmics and clarifies that we are responsible for order fulfillment and branding.\nOn September 29, 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NorthShore University Health System, or NorthShore, to further develop their Health Heritage software platform, or Health Heritage, and to license the software to customers. As part of the agreement, we will pay NorthShore a one-time license fee of $5.0 million and minimum annual royalties of $750,000 for the first four years of the agreement. We will have no obligation to pay any additional royalties after seven years or once aggregate royalties reach $5.0 million.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn March 2017, a number of putative class action securities complaints were filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, naming as defendants the Company and certain of our executive officers and directors. The pending complaints are captioned Deora v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01825, Di Rienzo v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01912, and Shafik v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01940. Some of the complaints also name as defendants investment banks who were underwriters in our initial public offering. The complaints generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material misstatements and omissions concerning NantHealth's business, operations, and results. In particular, the complaints refer to an article in alleging that defendants misrepresented NantHealth's business with the University of Utah and donations to the university by non-profit entities associated with our founder Dr. Soon-Shiong. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief on behalf of putative classes of persons who purchased or acquired NantHealth securities in the IPO or on the open market from the time of the initial public offering through early March 2017. We believe that the claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. The monetary and other impact of this action may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise resolve this matter may be significant and divert management's attention. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in this lawsuit. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in this matter, we could be required to pay substantial amounts which might materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of accompanying Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee Note 21 of accompanying notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of related party transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n- 118 -\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock based compensation arrangements granted to employees in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation: Stock Compensation\u201d, by measuring the grant date fair value of the award and recognizing the resulting expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.\nWe account for stock based compensation arrangements issued to non-employees using the fair value approach prescribed by ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d. The value of non-employee stock based compensation is re-measured at the end of each reporting period until the award vests and is recognized as stock based compensation expense over the period during which the non-employee provides the services.\nStock based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate service period for awards that are only subject to service conditions and is recognized using the accelerated attribution method for awards that are subject to performance conditions. Stock based compensation expense is only recognized for awards subject to performance conditions if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.\nWe early adopted FASB ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d) related to stock based compensation, beginning July 1, 2016, simplifying the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. Per ASU 2016-09, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. We have elected to account for forfeitures when they occur. Cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity in the Statement of Cash Flows.\nSoftware Developed for Internal Use\nWe account for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with FASB ASC 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other \" (\"ASC 350\"). Computer software development costs are expensed as incurred, except for internal use software that qualify for capitalization as described below, and include employee related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses; costs of computer hardware and software; and costs incurred in developing features and functionality. These capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. We expense costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of software development and capitalizes costs incurred in the application development stage and costs associated with significant enhancements to existing internal use software applications. Software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years commencing when the software project is ready for its intended use.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services or products have been provided to the client, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. While most of the our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we on occasion provide payment terms to clients in excess of one year from the date of contract signing. We do not recognize revenue for arrangements containing these extended payment terms until such payments become due. Certain of our customer arrangements allow for termination for convenience with advanced notice. Such termination rights do not allow for refunds other than prepaid PCS or other services. These provisions do not affect the recognition of revenue. We also have certain arrangements which allow for termination and refunds of fees in the event that software acceptance by the customer has not occurred. In these instances, we will defer all revenue until software acceptance has occurred.\nThe sequencing and molecular analysis revenue is primarily generated from payments received from commercial third-party payors, hospitals and other provider networks and patients. We report revenue from arrangements with these customers on a gross basis in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations. We recognize revenue from these arrangements when all revenue recognition criteria have been met or on a cash basis when it cannot conclude that the fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We use judgment in our assessment of whether the fees are fixed or determinable and whether collectability is reasonably assured in determining when to recognize revenue in the future as it continues to gain payment experience with our customers. Accordingly, we expect to recognize revenue on a cash basis when we cannot conclude that the fees from a particular customer are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured until it has a sufficient history to reliably estimate payment patterns from such customer.\n- 119 -\nWe engage in various multiple-element arrangements, which may generate revenue across any of the sources noted above. For multiple-element software arrangements that involve the sale of our proprietary software, PCS, and other software-related services, VSOE of fair value is required to allocate and recognize revenue for each element. VSOE of fair value is determined based on the price charged in which each deliverable is sold separately. We have established VSOE for PCS on certain of our software solutions using the Stated Renewal Method. In this instance, we have determined that our stated renewals are substantive and appropriate for use in the Stated Renewal Method. We have not yet established VSOE of fair value for any element other than PCS for our arrangements. In situations where VSOE of fair value exists for PCS but not a delivered element (typically the software license and services elements), the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the undelivered element equal to its VSOE value with the remainder allocated to the delivered elements. In situations in which VSOE of fair value does not exist for all of the undelivered software-related elements, revenue is deferred until only one undelivered element remains (typically the PCS element) and then recognized following the pattern of delivery of the final undelivered element. Our multiple element arrangements typically provide for renewal of PCS terms upon expiration of the original term. The amounts of these PCS renewals are recognized as revenue ratably over the specified PCS renewal period.\nFor non-software arrangements that include multiple elements, primarily consisting of our SaaS agreements, revenue recognition involves the identification of separate units of accounting after consideration of combining and/or segmenting contracts and allocation of the arrangement consideration to the units of accounting on the basis of their relative selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on VSOE of fair value, if available, third party evidence, or TPE, of fair value if VSOE is not available, or our best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In determining the units of accounting for these arrangements, we evaluate whether each deliverable has standalone value as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance. Our SaaS arrangements are treated as a single unit of accounting as the professional services do not have standalone value. As a result, we recognize initial system implementation and deployment fees ratably over a period of time from when the system implementation or deployment services are completed and accepted by the customer over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated customer life. SaaS revenue consists of revenue earned from clients (typically on a monthly basis) for use of our subscription or license-based solutions and services. We recognize revenue from such contracts ratably over the contract period.\nIf an arrangement to deliver software requires significant production, modification or customization of the licensed software, we account for the arrangement as a construction-type contract. Currently we recognize revenue for these arrangements using the completed-contract method as it does not currently have sufficient information to reliably estimate the percentage of completion for these projects. We consider these arrangements to be substantially complete upon the clients' acceptance of the software and related professional services and consistently apply this policy to all contract accounting arrangements.\nTransaction processing fees are recognized on a monthly basis based on the number of transactions processed and the fee per transaction.\nRevenue derived from reseller arrangements is recognized when the resellers, in turn, sell the software solution to their clients and installation of the software solution has occurred, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. This is commonly referred to as the sell-through method and we defer recognition until there is a sell-through by the reseller to an actual end user clients and acceptance by the end user has occurred.\nProfits Interest Plan\nOn December 3, 2013, we adopted the Profits Interests Plan and reserved an aggregate of 63.8 million Series C units for issuance to our associates, consultants and contractors in consideration for bona fide services provided.\nThe Series C units were considered profits interests of us and did not entitle their holders (the \"Series C members\") to receive distributions if we were liquidated immediately after the grant. Instead, the Series C members were entitled to receive an allocation of a portion of our profits and losses arising after the date of the grant and, subject to vesting conditions, distributions made out of a portion of the our profits arising after the grant date of the Series C units. Grants of the Series C units were either fully vested, partially vested, or entirely unvested at the time of the grant as determined by the our Board of Directors.\nSeries C members were not entitled to receive any distributions until our aggregate distributions exceeded a hurdle amount applicable to those Series C units. The hurdle amount for each grant was determined by the Board of Directors at the date of issuance of such units. After all other members received their applicable hurdle amount, the Series C members were entitled to receive their percentage interest of such excess distributions.\n- 120 -\nPrior to the LLC Conversion on June 1, 2016, we had 3.5 million Series C units outstanding. Upon the LLC Conversion on June 1, 2016, we issued 28,973 shares of common stock to holders of vested Series C units and 10,462 shares of restricted stock to holders of unvested Series C units. The shares of restricted stock issued to holders of unvested profits interest are subject to forfeiture until becoming fully vested in accordance with the terms of the original Series C unit grant agreements.\nStock compensation expense for the Series C units/restricted stock issued to the nonemployees is calculated based on the fair value of the aware on each balance sheet date and the attribution of that cost is being recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nPhantom Unit Plan\nOn March 31, 2015, we approved the Phantom Unit Plan. The maximum number of phantom units that may be issued under the Phantom Unit Plan is equal to 11.6 million minus the number of issued and outstanding Series C units. As of December 31, 2016, we had 4.3 million phantom units outstanding under the Phantom Unit Plan. Each grant of phantom units made to a participant under the Phantom Unit Plan vests over a defined service period, subject to completion of a liquidity event, and is subject to forfeiture upon termination of the participant's continuous service to us for any reason. Our IPO satisfied the liquidity event condition, and the phantom units now entitle their holders to cash or non-cash payments in an amount equal to the number of vested units held by that participant multiplied by the fair market value of our common stock, as determined by our board of directors.\nWe intend to settle all vested phantom unit payments held by United States-based participants in shares of our common stock and classified these awards as equity awards in our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet. Awards held by participants who are based outside of the United States will be settled in cash and are classified within accrued expenses on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. In order to satisfy payroll withholding tax obligations triggered by the issuance of shares of common stock to holders of vested phantom units, we issue recipients a net lower number of shares of common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations, and remitted a cash payment for the related withholding taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 1.1 million shares of common stock, after withholding 0.5 million shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. We made a cash payment of $5.8 million to cover employee withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes upon the settlement of these vested phantom units. We also paid $0.2 million to cash-settle 17 thousand vested phantom units held by participants of the Phantom Unit Plan based outside of the United States.\nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards\nWe had federal, state and foreign income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $238.9 million, $169.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, available to offset taxable income in tax year 2017 and thereafter. The federal NOL's will start to expire in year 2023.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that we have recently undergone one or more ownership changes. The above NOL amounts do not include the NOLs expected to expire before they can be utilized under Section 382.\nThe occurrence of such ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and possibly other tax attributes. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect. Any further ownership change also could cause such NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unused, thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows.\nIn addition, we may determine that varying state laws with respect to NOL utilization may result in lower limits, or an inability to utilize NOLs in some states altogether, which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes. In the event that state law results in lower limits, or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards, or we become subject to federal alternative minimum tax, this could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the\n- 121 -\npurchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We routinely monitor the factors impacting the acquired assets and liabilities. Transaction related costs are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or between annual tests when an impairment indicator exists. In the event there is a change in reporting units or segments, we will test for impairment at the reporting unit. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nAs part of the annual impairment test, we may conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets.\nIf an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. If a reporting unit's fair value is lower than its carrying value, we must determine the amount of implied goodwill that would be established if the reporting unit was hypothetically acquired on the impairment test date. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the amount of implied goodwill, we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess.\nThe determination of fair value of a reporting unit is based on a combination of a market approach that considers benchmark company market multiples and an income approach that uses discounted cash flows for each reporting unit utilizing Level 3 inputs. Under the income approach, we determine the fair value based on the present value of the most recent income projections for each reporting unit and calculates a terminal value utilizing a terminal growth rate. The significant assumptions under this approach include, among others: income projections, which are dependent on sales to new and existing clients, new solution introductions, client behavior, competitor pricing, operating expenses, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The cash flows used to determine fair value are dependent on a number of significant management assumptions based on historical experience, expectations of future performance, and the expected economic environment. Estimates are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future results. Additionally, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate are based on judgment of the rates that would be utilized by a hypothetical market participant.\nAccounting guidance requires that definite-lived intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets and ratably amortize the value over the estimated useful lives of those assets. If the estimates of the useful lives change, we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives or, if an asset is deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the value of the asset to its fair value may be required at such time.\nInvestment in Related Party\nInvestment in and advances to a related party in which we have a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20% to 50%, or for which we exercise significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. An investment in a limited liability company that is similar to partnership is also accounted for under the equity method if more than minor influence over the operation of the investee exists (generally through more than 3-5% ownership). As part of that accounting, we recognize gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by a related party that results in changes in the proportionate share of the dollar amount of the related party's equity.\n- 122 -\nThe investment in related party is assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net loss. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee's financial performance, and our ability and intention to retain the investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment's market value. The new cost basis of the investment is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nThe fair value of its equity method investment would be determined using the income approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. The related cash flow forecasts are discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital at the date of valuation.\nDifferences between the carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the related party are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on our analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, our share of the related party's reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the related party's historical book values.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nWe have classified the interest make-whole provision of our convertible notes due 2021 issued in December 2016 as a derivative liability that is recorded at fair value. This derivative liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. The change in the fair value of this derivative liability of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due primarily to the change in the value of our common stock from the date of issuance of our convertible notes to December 31, 2016.\nIncome taxes\nFASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ( Topic 740 \u201d) provides the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognizing, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including taking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided to us by our tax advisers, our legal advisers and similar tax cases. If at a later time our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or decrease.\n- 123 -\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company,\u201d we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act, including those relating to (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC with at least $700 million of outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years, or (iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\u201d and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs, assumptions, and information currently available to our management, and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, those described in greater detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company focused on enabling our clients to fundamentally change the diagnosis, treatment and pharmacoeconomics of cancer and other critical illnesses. We believe a molecular-driven, systems-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on large-scale, real time biometric and phenotypical data will become the standard of care initially for patients with cancer and, ultimately, other critical illnesses. We derive revenue from selling GPS Cancer (our Genomic Proteomic Spectrometry Cancer test, a unique, comprehensive molecular test and decision support solution that measures the proteins present in the patient's tumor tissue, combined with whole genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of tumor & normal samples), to which we obtained exclusive access from an affiliate, and NantOS and NantOS apps to healthcare providers and payors, self-insured employers and biopharmaceutical companies. NantOS and NantOS apps include proprietary methods and algorithms for enabling healthcare providers to make better treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes and lower the cost of care, and allow healthcare payors to ensure that their dependents receive high quality care in a cost-effective manner. We believe that as healthcare providers and payors migrate to value-based reimbursement models and implement advances in precision medicine, our offerings position us at the forefront of multiple significant market opportunities.\nWe market NantHealth solutions (which was originally introduced to the market as CLINICS) as a comprehensive integrated solution that includes GPS Cancer, NantOS and the NantOS apps. We also market our GPS Cancer, NantOS, individual NantOS apps and suites of NantOS apps as stand-alone solutions. To accelerate our commercial growth and enhance our competitive advantage, we continue to:\n \u2022 introduce new marketing, education and engagement efforts and foster relationships across the oncology community to drive adoption of GPS Cancer; \n \u2022 pursue reimbursement of GPS Cancer from regional and national third-party payors and government payors and self-insured employers; \n \u2022 publish scientific and medical advances; \n \u2022 strengthen our commercial organization to increase our NantHealth solutions client base and to broaden usage of our solutions by existing clients who currently use only NantOS, specific NantOS apps or suites of NantOS apps; and \n \u2022 develop new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions to address the needs of current and future healthcare provider and payor, self-insured employer and biopharmaceutical company clients.  Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of NantHealth solutions, including NantOS and the NantOS apps, as well as the commercial launch of our GPS Cancer business. To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and as of December 31, 2016 our accumulated deficit was approximately $475.3 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses over the near term as we drive adoption of GPS Cancer, expand our commercial operations, and invest further in NantHealth solutions.\n- 98 -\nWe plan to (i) continue investing in our infrastructure, including but not limited to solution development, sales and marketing, implementation and support, (ii) continue efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline, (iii) add new clients through maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and solution development activities, (iv) expand our relationships with existing clients through delivery of add-on and complementary solutions and services and (v) continue our commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs. We believe that our growing client base using our NantOS and NantOS apps on a daily basis is a strategic asset, and we intend to expand sales of NantHealth solutions offerings towards this client base in order to leverage this strategic asset.\nRecent Developments\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed our IPO, whereby we sold 6,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. Additionally, on June 9, 2016, the underwriters partially exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional 400,000 shares of our common stock at $14.00 per share.\nWe received a total of $83.6 million in net proceeds from our IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $13.0 million. The offering was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-211196), as amended.\nIn December 2016, we issued convertible notes to a related party and others for net proceeds of $9.9 million and $92.8 million, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $4.2 million. Please see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these convertible notes.\nRecent Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have made several significant acquisitions and investments in 2014, 2015 and 2016, which have expanded the features and functionality of NantHealth solutions, including the following:\n \u2022 NDO In June 2014, we acquired NDO, which provides healthcare interoperability and informatics solutions through its cOS platform to address population health issues. Our results of operations include the impact of the NDO acquisition as of June 2014. \n \u2022 NantOmics In June 2015, we invested a substantial portion of our available capital in NantOmics, a majority owned subsidiary of NantWorks. Our investment represents approximately 14.3% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of NantOmics. Our relationship with NantOmics provides us with access to what we believe is the nation's only CAP- and CLIA-certified whole genome and quantitative proteomics laboratory. \n \u2022 Healthcare Solutions ( HCS\u201d) In July 2015, we acquired certain assets related to HCS business from Harris Corporation. We believe the acquired assets will help complex healthcare delivery organizations achieve better patient outcomes, clinical and administrative workflow efficiency and stronger collaboration across the continuum of care. \n \u2022 NaviNet In January 2016, we acquired NaviNet, which provides a secure collaboration network connecting approximately 36 health plans and which is estimated to be utilized in more than 70% of the nation's physicians' offices during the fourth quarter of 2016. NaviNet Open will serve as a nationwide scalable and secure web-based portal for patients and providers.  Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share\nAdjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Our management believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance, because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for our core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for our core business between current, past and future periods . Other companies may define these measures in different ways. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All loss per share numbers contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated based on one class of common stock and do not incorporate the effects, if any, of using the two-class method.\n- 99 -\nAdjusted net loss excludes the effects of (1) loss from equity method investments, (2) stock based compensation expense, (3) intangible amortization, (4) corporate restructuring expenses, (5) BP settlement other income, (6) acquisition related compensation expense, (7) acquisition-related sales incentives, which have been recorded as contra revenue, (8) change in fair value of derivatives liability, (9) non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, and (10) Benefit for (provision from) income taxes adjustment includes the impact of the conversion from a limited liability corporation to a corporation, the impact of convertible notes offering and the impact of intangibles amortization.\nAdjusted shares outstanding include Series F redeemable shares as if converted on January 1, 2014.\nThe following table reconciles Net loss to Net loss per share -

non-GAAP, weighted-average shares outstanding, weighted average Series F units/redeemable stock and shares outstanding - non-GAAP, have been computed to give effect to the LLC conversion that occurred June 1, 2016 prior to our initial public offering. In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, (a) all of our outstanding units automatically converted into shares of common stock, based on the relative rights of our pre-IPO equityholders as set forth in the limited liability company agreement and (b) we adopted and filed a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware and adopted bylaws. We filed an amended certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-5.5 reverse stock split of our common stock on June 1, 2016. Please see Note 18 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the LLC conversion and related transactions. \n (2) The weighted-average shares outstanding have been further adjusted to account for the redeemable Series F units (converted to common stock in conjunction with the LLC conversion), whose put right expired on June 20, 2016. Prior to June 20, 2016, these units/shares of common stock were classified as redeemable members'/stockholders' equity in the balance sheet, and as such, were not included in the weighted-average shares outstanding prior to June 20, 2016. The put right expired June 20, 2016, and the shares were no longer redeemable and are included in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2016. The weighted-average shares are adjusted to include the redeemable common stock in the weighted-average shares outstanding for the entire period. Please see Note 18 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the LLC conversion and related transactions.  Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate our revenue from the sale of licensed software, maintenance, software-as-a-service, hardware and services. Our Systems Infrastructure and platforms support the delivery of both personalized comprehensive sequencing and molecular analysis and the implementation of value-based care models across the healthcare continuum. We generate revenue from the following sources:\n- 101 -\nSoftware, middleware and hardware - Software, middleware and hardware revenue is generated from the sale of NantOS and NantOS apps software on either a perpetual or term license basis, and the sale of our hardware. The software is installed on the client's site or the client's designated vendor's site and is not hosted by us or by a vendor contracted by us. We also generate revenue from the resale of third-party software and hardware to our clients. Our software and hardware solutions sold include components of our NantOS, including FusionFX, cOS, DeviceConX and HBox.\nSoftware-as-a-service - Software-as-a-service, or SaaS, revenue is generated from our clients' access to and usage of our hosted software solutions on a subscription basis for a specified contract term, which is typically annually. In our SaaS arrangements, the client cannot take possession of the software during the term of the contract and generally only has the right to access and use the software and receive any software upgrades published during the subscription period. Solutions sold under a SaaS model include our eviti platform solutions,NantOS and NantOS apps. SaaS revenue may include hosting of our software solutions on behalf of the client.\nMaintenance - Maintenance revenue includes ongoing post-contract client support, or PCS, or maintenance during the paid PCS term. Additionally, PCS includes ongoing development of software updates and upgrades provided to the client on a when and if available basis. We sell NantOS, including DeviceConX and FusionFX, with maintenance contracts.\nSequencing and molecular analysis - Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue is generated by the process of performing sequencing and analysis of whole genome DNA, RNA and proteomic results, including GPS Cancer. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of the analysis and reporting of the results to the client or on a cash basis when it cannot conclude that the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nOther services - Other services revenue includes revenue from professional services we provide that are generally complementary to our software solutions and may or may not be required for the solution to function as desired by the client. When associated with software, there services are generally provided in the form of training and implementation services during the software license period and do not include PCS. Other services revenue also includes revenue related to nursing and therapy services provided to patients in a home care setting and any other services not included in the preceding revenue sources.\nWe have established VSOE for PCS on certain of our software solutions. We have not yet established VSOE of fair value for any element other than PCS for a portion of our arrangements. In situations where VSOE of fair value exists for PCS but not a delivered element, the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the undelivered element equal to our VSOE value with the remainder allocated to the delivered elements. In situations where our services are essential to the functionality of our software and VSOE of fair value for PCS does not exist, we defer revenue and costs until we have delivered all elements of the arrangement and amortize revenue and costs over the initial PCS period. For our contracts with multiple elements, we defer revenue until only one undelivered element remains and then recognize the revenue following the pattern of delivery of the final undelivered element. The timing and pattern of this revenue recognition can cause variations in revenue from period-to-period.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs for associates providing services to our clients and supporting our revenue-generating platform infrastructure, including salaries, benefits and bonuses. Additional expenses include consultant costs, direct reimbursable travel expenses and other direct engagement costs associated with the design, development, sale and installation of our solutions, including system support and maintenance services. Our cost of revenue associated with each of our revenue sources is as follows:\n \u25aa Software, middleware and hardware - Software and hardware cost of revenue includes third-party software and hardware costs directly associated with our solutions. \n \u25aa Software-as-a-service - SaaS cost of revenue includes personnel-related, amortization of deferred implementation costs and other direct costs associated with the delivery and hosting of NantOS and NantOS apps, including eviti, our cancer-decision support solution, and NaviNet on a subscription basis. \n \u25aa Maintenance - Maintenance cost of revenue includes personnel-related and other direct costs associated with the ongoing support or maintenance we provide for our clients. \n \u25aa Sequencing and molecular analysis - Sequencing and molecular analysis cost of revenue includes internal costs associated with these services and amounts due to NantOmics under our Reseller Agreement for the sequencing and analysis of whole genome, DNA, RNA and proteomic results. \n- 102 -\n \u25aa Other services - Other services cost of revenue includes personnel-related costs, amortization of deferred implementation costs and other direct costs associated with software training and implementation services provided to our clients as well as direct expenses relating to our nursing and therapy services provided to patients in a home care setting.  Cost of revenue also includes amortization of our developed technologies used to generate revenue. We plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. We expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we expand NantHealth solutions and realize economies of scale.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative, research and development, and amortization of software license and acquisition-related assets.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of shared service fees from NantWorks, personnel-related expenses for our sales and marketing, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative associates, stock based compensation, and advertising and marketing promotions of NantHealth solutions. It also includes trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, point of purchase display expenses and related amortization as well as legal costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate and administrative costs.\nWith the exception of stock based compensation, we expect our selling, general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to attract new clients, broaden usage of our solutions by existing clients, and expand our brand. Additionally, we expect to incur additional costs for legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with operating as a public company. These increases include additional costs we expect to incur associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies as well as increased costs for directors' and officers' liability insurance and an enhanced investor relations function. However, we expect our selling, general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as our revenue increases and we realize economies of scale.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for associates working on development of solutions, including salaries, benefits and stock based compensation. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees to third-party development resources.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new software solutions and improving our existing software solutions. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred as the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of software solutions for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWith the exception of stock based compensation, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the short term as we continue to make significant investments in developing new solutions and enhancing the functionality of our existing solutions. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we realize economies of scale from our developed technology.\nAmortization of Software License and Acquisition Related Assets\nAmortization of software license and acquisition related assets consists of non-cash amortization expense related to our non-revenue generating technology as well as amortization expense that we recognize on intangible assets that we acquired through our investments.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net primarily consists of interest expense associated with our outstanding borrowings offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n- 103 -\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of unrealized and realized gains (losses) on and dividends received from our marketable securities and other non-recurring items.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Method Investments\nIncome (Loss) from equity method investments consists of our pro rata share of income and losses of a company that we own an ownership interest in and account for under the equity method of accounting.\nWe regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other than temporary impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state and foreign income taxes. To date, we have no significant U.S. federal, state and foreign cash income taxes because of our LLC status prior to June 1, 2016 and current and accumulated net operating losses.\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all the available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\n- 104 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 325: <table><tr><td> </td>

that occurred June 1, 2016 prior to our initial public offering. In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, (a) all of our outstanding units automatically converted into shares of common stock, based on the relative rights of our pre-IPO equityholders as set forth in the limited liability company agreement and (b) we adopted and filed a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware and adopted bylaws. We filed an amended certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-5.5 reverse stock split of our common stock on June 1, 2016. \n (2) The net income (loss) per share for the common stock for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 reflects $4,958 and $16,042 in accretion value allocated to the redeemable common stock, respectively. The redeemable common stock contained a put right, which expired unexercised on June 20, 2016.

2016\nTotal revenue increased $42.1 million or 72.2% from $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our total revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and from our acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016. Our acquisition of certain assets of HCS resulted in the contribution of $19.2 million in primarily maintenance, SaaS, and other services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to approximately $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our acquisition of NaviNet resulted in the contribution of $40.8 million mainly in SaaS revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe that a significant opportunity exists to expand sequencing and molecular analysis revenue as we expand both the number of GPS profiles delivered as well as obtaining additional insurance reimbursement for our GPS profile.\nTotal software-related revenue was $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $31.3 million or 88.4%. Our total software-related revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and from the acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016. We also experienced growth in our Nant OS cancer decision support revenue from expansion in our customer base for those products. These increases were partially offset by a $11.6 million decrease in software and hardware revenue recognized from completed implementations of our DeviceConX, as well as decreases in our NantOS Interoperability (formerly cOS) platforms compared to the same period in the prior year. Software related revenue in the prior year ended December 31, 2015 included recognition of revenue from certain large DeviceConX arrangements which had been previously deferred pending completion of implementation.\nSoftware and hardware revenue decreased $6.4 million or 43.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to a decreased amount of completed DeviceConX implementations. Software and hardware revenue attributed to NantOS DeviceConX is recognized upon the completion of each implementation. A decline of $7.2 million was attributable to a reduction in the number of completed large implementations during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease was offset by a $1.0 million incremental increase as a result of the HCS acquisition. In 2015, there were more projects in excess of $1.0 million dollars in contract value completed compared with to 2016. We believe opportunities exist to grow software and hardware revenue through completion of both existing implementations as well as executing new sales bookings from our pipeline of opportunities.\nSaaS revenue was $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $37.6 million or 181.5% from $20.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by increased NantOS revenue including $1.0 million of FusionFX revenue acquired with the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and revenue of $41.0 million from the acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016 in connection with SaaS revenue. In addition, revenue from our NantOS cancer decision support (formerly Eviti) platform solutions increased $1.5 million, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in revenue from other NantOS Interoperability platforms.\nMaintenance revenue increased $3.8 million or 36.2% from $10.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015. Acquired NantOS (formerly Harris HCS) maintenance customers contributed to an increase of $3.9 million in maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n- 107 -\nSequencing and molecular analysis revenue during the period included revenue recognized for GPS profiles for which fees are fixed and determinable under a payor agreement as well as what was recognized on a cash basis due to uncertainty over reimbursement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $0.6 million in sequencing and molecular analysis revenue. There are significant opportunities going forward as we gain momentum in gaining coverage in the US with commercial health plans and self-insured employers and globally with supplemental benefits insurers, while at the same time building GPS adoption among oncologists, including the community and academic institutions.\nWe are aggressively expanding our sales efforts by adding seasoned sales and account management professionals in 2017. The commercial team's efforts are focused around the development of pilots with commercial insurance payers who would agree to pay for a certain number of GPS profiles, aligned with designated provider groups who will order the GPS test, and reimbursement is recognized. The pipeline of pilot opportunities going into 2017 is in excess of $10.0 million dollars. Our pipeline of self-insured employers includes opportunities with many companies listed on Fortune's 100, as well as an alliance of 50 of the largest employers in the US. Most recently, we announced a partnership with the International Association of Firefighters, which is significant not only because of its size, but because its incidence of cancer is much greater than the average population, and in 37 states, there are presumptive laws around job related cancer for firefighters, which has opened discussions for us related to worker's compensation as well.\nOther services revenue increased $6.5 million or 52.4% from $12.4 million in 2015 to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily driven by the completion of a large NantOS Interoperability (formerly Harris HCS) software related services project which contributed to NantOS interoperability services revenue growth of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and incremental growth of $0.2 million from the NaviNet acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease of NantOS DeviceConX solutions due to a decline in the number of completed large projects.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-sell opportunities of our suite of solutions across our existing customer base, including the recently acquired HCS FusionFX and NaviNet customer bases. We are also integrating the cOS, FusionFX and NaviNet product solutions, within our NantOS platform, and believe that opportunities exist to cross-sell this combination of solutions to existing former HCS, FusionFX and NaviNet customers as well as to new customers. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS sequencing analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future maintenance and SaaS recurring revenue streams.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nTotal revenue increased $24.4 million, or 71.9%, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our total revenue growth came in all of our revenue categories and was driven primarily by growth in our existing solutions including NantOS (DeviceConX and cOS), eviti and sequencing and molecular analysis, as well as our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015. Our acquisition of certain assets of HCS resulted in the contribution of $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.9 million in SaaS, maintenance and other services revenue, respectively, for the year ended 2015.\nOur total software-related revenue (including software, hardware, and SaaS) increased to $35.4 million for 2015 from $18.2 million for 2014, an increase of $17.2 million, or 94.8%. This growth came primarily from growth in revenue from our NantOS (DeviceConX and cOS) and eviti solutions, as well as our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015.\nSoftware and hardware revenue increased to $14.6 million for 2015 from $8.4 million for the year ended 2014, an increase of $6.2 million, or 74.6%. This growth was primarily driven by an increased amount of completed NantOS component DeviceConX implementations. Software and hardware revenue attributed to DeviceConX is recognized upon the completion of each implementation.\nSaaS revenue increased to $20.7 million for 2015 from $9.8 million for the year ended 2014, an increase of $11.0 million, or 112.0%. This increase was primarily driven by increased NantOS sales (including our Fusion family of products, or Fusion), revenue acquired with the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and eviti platform revenue. eviti platform revenue grew to approximately $13.9 million for 2015 from $8.9 million for 2014, an increase of $5.0 million, or 56%. eviti revenue growth was primarily driven by an expansion in volume with our existing payor customer base. cOS revenue included under SaaS was positively impacted by the recognition of $4.7 million in previously deferred revenue related to a client arrangement which ended in 2015. Finally, we recognized approximately $0.9 million in acquired Fusion SaaS revenue for 2015.\nMaintenance revenue increased to $10.5 million for 2015 from $5.3 million for 2014, an increase of $5.1 million, or 95.5%. Maintenance revenue growth was primarily driven by both an increase in customer base of DeviceConX as a result of completed implementations as well as acquired Fusion maintenance customers which contributed approximately $1.1 million in maintenance revenue for 2015.\n- 108 -\nThe increase in other services revenue of $2.0 million for December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by both the increase in the number of completed DeviceConX implementations as well as higher volume in our home healthcare business, or Assisteo. Our Assisteo home healthcare business benefited from an expanded relationship with a skilled nursing facility in 2015.\nWe expected to launch our commercial sequencing and molecular analysis solution, or GPS Cancer, in the second quarter of 2016. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement to provide certain research related sequencing services to a research institution. The agreement provides that the institution pay us $10.0 million in exchange for our providing sequencing services through our reseller agreement with NantOmics. In 2015, we provided $6.2 million of services, which has been recorded as a deemed capital contribution instead of revenue. At the institution's request, certain non-profit organizations provided partial funding for the sequencing and related bioinformatics costs associated with the project. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a member of the board of directors of, and may have significant influence or control over, these organizations. The institution was not contractually or otherwise required to use our molecular profiling solution or any of our other products or services as part of the charitable gift. In 2016, we completed another $3.8 million in services, which was recorded as deemed capital contributions.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-sell opportunities of our suite of solutions across our existing customer base including the recently acquired HCS and Fusion customer bases. We are also integrating the cOS, Fusion and NaviNet and believe that opportunities exist to cross sell this to existing Fusion and NaviNet customers as well as to new customers. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS sequencing analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future maintenance and SaaS recurring revenue streams.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,937.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-91.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software-as-a-service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-12.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total software-related cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,942\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-21.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sequencing and molecular analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,994.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of developed technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nCost of revenue increased $37.5 million, or 107.8% from $34.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenue increased across all categories primarily as a result of acquisitions of HCS and NaviNet ($22.9 million). Additionally, we incurred $8.4 million of stock compensation expenses in the year period ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero in 2015.\nTotal software-related cost of revenue increased $19.4 million or 273.4% from $7.1 million in 2015 to $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers were the acquisitions of HCS and NaviNet which contributed increases of $0.7 million and $13.9 million respectively. Additionally, the Company has incurred $4.5 million of stock compensation expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016 versus zero in the same period last year.\nSequencing and molecular analysis increased $1.9 million or 4,994.9% from $0.04 million in 2015 compared to $2.0 million in 2016. We record the cost of revenue expense upon delivery of the GPS report to our clients. As a result, there will be a timing difference between the revenue recorded and the cost of revenue recorded. In addition, the cost of revenue is recorded as defined by the applicable contract with our clients and as outlined in the amended and restated Reseller Agreement for genomic and proteomic sequencing services and related bioinformatics and analysis services with NantOmics.\n- 109 -\nWe believe that there are significant opportunities going forward to grow the volume of sequencing and molecular analysis activity which would increase the associated costs of delivering such revenue. We record the cost of revenue expense upon delivery of the GPS report to our clients. There may be a timing difference between the revenue recorded and the cost of revenue recorded in the event that revenue recognition is delayed. Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue in the current period was limited to what could be recognized on a cash basis due to uncertainty over reimbursement for the GPS profiles delivered in the period. As we gain additional insurance coverage and reimbursement experience, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of GPS revenue which is recognized on a cash basis.\nOther services cost of revenue increased $10.3 million or 67.5% from $15.2 million in 2015 to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers were an incremental increase of $8.0 million as a result of the acquisition of HCS as well as an increase of $4.4 million in our NantOS Interoperability and Home Health Services lines of businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in cost of revenue associated with sequencing services provided to a research institution, as well as a decrease of $0.7 million in DeviceConX solutions due to a decline in the number of completed large projects.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nTotal cost of revenue increased $10.6 million, or 43.7%, from $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of an $8.2 million increase in our other services cost of revenue and a $2.9 million increase in our amortization of developed technologies, compared to 2014. The increase in total cost of revenue was partially offset by a decline in costs for software-related revenue of $1.9 million.\nThe $8.2 million increase in other services cost of revenue referenced above was primarily due to $3.7 million in amounts owed to NantOmics related to sequencing and molecular analysis performed for a research institution, incremental costs associated with the newly-acquired Fusion product revenue, and costs related to business expansion of our home health business for the year ended 2015. The increase in the amortization of developed technologies cost of revenue is due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition of HCS and full calendar year of amortization in 2015 versus a partial year of amortization in 2014 for the acquisition of NDO.\nThe $1.9 million reduction in total software-related cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a reduction in costs associated with certain cOS projects in 2015 versus 2014 as well as a reduction in certain hardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million or 74.8% from $69.0 million in 2015 to $120.7 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to $27.7 million increase in stock compensation expenses in connection with the vesting of phantom units upon consummation of our IPO and an increase of $9.0 million in personnel related expenses, a $6.3 million increase in professional services as well as selling and marketing expenses in connection with the growth of the business, $4.9 million due to increased investments in information technology and depreciation and amortization expenses as we invest in assets to support future growth. The balance is due to an increase in general overhead expenses as well as acquisition related expenses.

This increase was driven in part by a $8.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a higher headcount, including increased costs associated with severance pay, bonus accruals and stock-based compensation expense. In addition, in 2015, we experienced an increase of an additional $9.6 million of expenses related to the acquisition of HCS (of which approximately $1.5 million was one-time in nature), a $3.6 million increase in professional services and internal information technology resources related expenses, and $1.5 million increase in other expenses, including a donation to support an academic cancer research center in the United Kingdom.\nResearch and Development\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nResearch and development expenses increased $37.8 million or 158.6%, from $23.8 million in 2015 to $61.6 million in 2016. This increase was driven by an increase of $16.4 million in stock compensation expense in connection with the vesting of equity awards upon the consummation of our IPO and Series C/restricted stock vesting, as well as the inclusion of research and development expenses of HCS and NaviNet. Specifically, we had $16.3 million due to an increase in personnel related expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in investments in information technology as we invest in assets to support future growth. In addition, we saw a $1.2 million increase in professional services expenses in connection with the growth of the business. Finally, we saw a $0.7 million increase in research and development general overhead expenses due to timing of certain research and development projects as well as the inclusion of research and development expenses of NaviNet. We expect to continue to invest in opportunities to leverage our solutions towards growth in our molecular sequencing and analysis and other solutions revenue.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.9 million, or 40.4%, from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by $4.7 million of expense related to the HCS acquisition in July 2015, and a $2.1 million increase due to higher headcount and associated personnel-related expenses as we invested in the development of our software and hardware solutions.\nInterest Expense, Net\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,340\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(980\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>911.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2016, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $107 million of our 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the \"Convertible Notes\") in a private placement offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, of which $10 million were issued to related party.

Please see the section entitled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the Convertible Notes.\n- 111 -\nIn January 2016, we executed a demand promissory note with NantCapital (the \"NantCapital Note\"), a personal investment vehicle for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a promissory note with NantOmics (the \"NantOmics Note\"). Through December 31, 2016, the total advances made by NantCapital and NantOmics to us pursuant to each applicable note amounted to approximately $112.7 million and $40.0 million, respectively. We can request additional advances subject to NantCapital and NantOmics approval. Each note bears interest at a per annum rate of 5.0% compounded annually and computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the year.\nIn May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. On December 15, 2016, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated May 9, 2016, between us and NantCapital, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note to June 30, 2022 and to subordinate the Promissory Note in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. In addition, in May 2016, the NantOmics Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest would be converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price at the time of pricing of the IPO. Later in May 2016, the NantOmics Note was further amended and restated to remove the automatic conversion feature and to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. In June 2016, the NantOmics Note was further amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest will be converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price after the pricing of the IPO and after the LLC Conversion. The NantOmics Note and all related accrued interest was converted on June 1, 2016 into 2,899,297 shares of our common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, there were no unpaid amounts related to the advances on the NantOmics Note.

This increase in interest expense, net, was due to the accrual of interest under the Convertible Notes, the NantOmics Note and the NantCapital Note.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nInterest expense, net decreased $0.4 million, or 36.0%, from $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

In the year ended December 31, 2015, other income of $2.5 million was primarily derived from the dividend income and fair value adjustment from marketable securities. These marketable securities were liquidated or transferred to fund acquisitions and business operations. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we wrote off a short term note of $0.5 million with a vendor. There were no comparable write offs during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining balance was primarily due to expenses related to currency fluctuations.\n- 112 -\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a reduction in fair value of derivatives liability of $1.2 million, related to the convertible notes interest make-whole issued in December 2016. Also in November 2016, as one of the claimants in a class action lawsuit against BP p.l.c., and its related entities ( BP\u201d) regarding the Deepwater Horizon Incident, we entered into a settlement agreement with B.P. Exploration & Production, Inc. whereby in exchange for a $1.0 million monetary settlement we released BP from claims relating to the Deepwater Horizon Incident. In January 2017, the final distribution sheet was received and executed from BP's counsel in Alabama including information related to the gross $1.0 million settlement amount mentioned above and total $0.2 million expenses incurred related to the settlement agreement, resulting in a net settlement receivable of $0.8 million booked as Other income on our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nOther income (expense), net increased $3.0 million, from expense of $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to income of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This change was primarily attributable to the $2.3 million of dividend and interest income received from our marketable securities, $0.5 million from the write-off of short term notes payable and $0.2 million reimbursement from NantWorks for services provided by NantHealth associates in 2015.\nIncome (Loss) from Related Party Equity Method Investments\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from related party equity method Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,486.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(269.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from equity method investments increased $38.4 million compared with the same period of the prior year, from 2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $41.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our loss from equity investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $29.8 million non-cash impairment charge as a result of our determination that the fair value of our investment in NantOmics had declined below our carrying value as of December 31, 2016, and that this decline in value was other than temporary. The decline in the fair value of our investment in NantOmics was primarily caused by a change in the risk profile of our financial projections for NantOmics resulting from the delay in our GPS revenue growth.\nThe increase in loss from equity method investments was due to the impairment mentioned above, our pro rata share of losses from our investment in NantOmics, and the amortization of the basis difference in the investment. We report our share of NantOmics' loss and the amortization of basis difference using a one quarter lag.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments decreased $4.1 million, from income of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to a loss of $2.6 million during the year December 31, 2015. In 2014, we had income primarily attributable to an increase in our pro rata share of income from our investment in NantPharma LLC, or NantPharma, of $1.7 million. We sold our interest in NantPharma during May 2014. In 2015, we recorded pro rata share of losses from our investment in NantOmics.\n- 113 -\nProvision for (Benefits from) Income taxes\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period-To-Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,811\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,732.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,000.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the benefit from income taxes was $22.8 million, compared with a $0.4 million provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a benefit from income taxes in the amount of $8.7 million arising from a deferred tax asset valuation allowance release due to the LLC conversion to a C corporation and forming a federal tax consolidated group. The deferred tax liability previously recorded in purchase accounting of NaviNet became a source of income for the valuation allowance release.\nWe also recorded in 2016 an income tax benefit in the amount of $8.6 million, arising from the recording of a deferred tax expense in additional paid in capital due to the convertible notes conversion option recorded to equity. The remaining income tax benefit mainly results from amortization of purchase accounting intangibles.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the provision for income taxes was $0.4 million, compared to $0.01 million income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $160.4 million, compared to $7.2 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $3.0 million and $0.6 million , respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and our ability to borrow from affiliated entities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity, through one or more follow-on public offerings or in separate financings, or sell additional debt securities or obtain a credit facility. Further, because of the risk and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of our existing products as well as products in development, we may need additional funds to meet our needs sooner than planned. To date, our primary sources of capital were private placements of preferred stock, debt financing agreements, including the NantCapital Note, our IPO and the Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (\"the Convertible Notes\").\nConvertible Notes\nIn December 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Jefferies LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers\u201d), to issue and sell $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In December 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Cambridge Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Cambridge Equities, L.P., an entity affiliated with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ( Cambridge\u201d), to issue and sell $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In December 2016, pursuant to the exercise of the overallotment by the Initial Purchasers, we issued an additional $7.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately $102.7 million, comprised of $9.9 million from Cambridge and $92.8 million from the Initial Purchasers, after deducting of Initial Purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs of $4.3 million in connection with the Convertible Notes offering.\n- 114 -\nOn December 21, 2016, we entered into an Indenture, relating to the issuance of the Convertible Notes (the Indenture\u201d), by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee\u201d). The interest rates are fixed at 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2021, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted pursuant to their terms. The initial conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is 82.3893 shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $12.14 per share). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2021, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, the last reported sale price of our common stock on such trading day is greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price on such trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which, for each day of that period, the trading price per $1 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes will be settled in cash, shares of the Company's common stock or any combination thereof at our option.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes in principal amounts of $1 thousand or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nNantCapital Note\nIn January 2016, we issued the NantCapital Note to NantCapital, a personal investment vehicle for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and CEO, and the NantOmics Note to NantOmics. As of March 31, 2016, the total advances made by NantCapital and NantOmics to us pursuant to each applicable note were approximately $112.7 million and $40.0 million, respectively. In May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. In May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. On December 15, 2016, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated May 9, 2016, between us and NantCapital, to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note and to subordinate the Promissory Note in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. We can request additional advances subject to NantCapital approval, and the NantCapital Note bears interest at a per annum rate of 5.0% compounded annually and computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the year. NantCapital has the option, but not the obligation, to require us to repay any such amount in cash, Series A-2 units of NantOmics (based on a per unit price of $1.484) held by us, shares of our common stock based on a per share price of $18.6126 (if such equity exists at the time of repayment), or any combination of the foregoing at the sole discretion of NantCapital.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity, our stockholders could experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marketing of our products and scale back our business and operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated:\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70,634\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95,262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(230,077\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 115 -\nTo date, our operations have been primarily financed through the proceeds from related party promissory notes and through equity issuances, including net cash proceeds from our IPO and net cash proceeds from our Convertible Notes private placement. In June 2016, we sold 6,900,000 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share, which includes 400,000 shares sold to the underwriter upon exercise of their overallotment option to purchase additional shares of our Company. We raised net proceeds of $83.6 million from our IPO, after underwriting fees, discounts and commissions of $4.9 million and other offering costs of $8.1 million. In December 2016 we issued Convertible Notes to related party and others for net proceeds of $102.7 million, $9.9 million from Cambridge and $92.8 million from others, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $4.3 million.\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities have been driven by rate of revenue, billings, and collections, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, and enhancements to existing services, and the timing of general and administrative expenses as we grow our administrative infrastructure, and the continuing market acceptance of our solution. In addition, our net loss in the year ended December 31, 2016 has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of substantial non-cash charges.\nCash used in operating activities of $70.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of our continued significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and increased expenses incurred as we became a public company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, and other expenses incurred to grow our business. In the year ended December 31, 2016, $102.6 million, or 56% of our net loss of $184.1 million consisted of non-cash items, including a $54.0 million in stock-based compensation, $30.9 million of depreciation and amortization, a $41.0 million equity in net loss of a related party investment, a $0.5 million provision for accounts receivable bad debts, a $0.5 million inventory provision, and other non-cash expenses of $0.1 million. The non-cash expenses were partially offset by non-cash income related to a deferred income tax benefit of $23.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $6.0 million increase in deferred implementation costs due to an increase in business activity associated with the growth of our business, $5.6 million in payments to vendors, and a $0.3 million increase in related party receivables, net. The cash used in operating activities was offset by a $8.1 million decrease in accounts receivable, net attributable to the receipt of payments from our clients, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.5 million, a $3.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased billings during the year ended December 31, 2016, a $3.8 million increase in accrued expenses, and an increase in $4.2 million in related party payables, net.\nCash used in operating activities of $74.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of spending on selling, administrative structure, and research and development efforts. In the year ended December 31, 2015, $20.4 million, or 28%, of our net loss of $72.0 million consisted of non-cash items, including $15.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation, and $0.3 million of changes in fair value of marketable securities. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 included a $21.2 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.7 million decrease in related party payables, net, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $4.2 million increase in deferred implementation costs, which were partially offset by an increase of $7.2 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $3.6 million decrease in accounts receivable, net and, a decrease of $1.0 million in inventory, and a decrease of $0.2 million in related party receivables, net.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in operating activities of $42.1 million consisted of a net loss of $84.6 million, primarily attributable to an increase in spending on selling, general and administrative expense and research and development efforts, and $1.0 million of cash used to fund changes in working capital, partially offset by $43.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in related party payables of $7.6 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $1.6 million offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of $4.6 million, a decrease in other liabilities of $2.9 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.9 million, an decrease in inventory of $2.3 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.5 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $24.2 million of intangible assets impairment as we realized a non-cash charge for the impairment of certain of our acquired intangible assets, $16.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.7 million of unrealized changes in fair value of our marketable securities, and $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions to expand our features and functionality of NantHealth solutions and capital expenditures to develop our software as well as to purchase computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure.\n- 116 -\nWe used $88.8 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily comprised of $78.7 million related to our acquisition of NaviNet, $15.8 million of purchases of equipment and investments in our capitalized software, partially offset by consideration received related to acquisitions of $4.4 million, proceeds from sale of marketable securities of $1.3 million and proceeds from sale of equipment of $0.1 million.\nWe used $95.3 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily comprised of investments in NantOmics of $150.8 million, acquisition of HCS of $48.1 million, investments in our capitalized software and purchase of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures of approximately $8.2 million, purchase of intangible asset of $5.0 million, and $1.8 million purchase of IOBS, partially offset by the proceeds of the sale of the marketable securities for $136.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $230.1 million, which primarily consisted of investments in marketable securities of $251.7 million as we invested our cash raised in mutual funds, purchase of intangible asset of $4.0 million, investment in unconsolidated related parties of $3.3 million, $7.6 million in capital expenditures and $2.3 million in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses. These were offset in part by $26.1 million in proceeds from sales of our marketable securities as we liquidated our investments as needed to provide for working capital and $12.8 million from the sale of businesses and equity method investments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $313.6 million was primarily due to $152.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of related party promissory notes, $83.6 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, as well as $9.9 million and $92.8 million, respectively of proceeds from the sale of convertible notes to a related party and others, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In addition, cash provided by financing activities was also due to $3.8 million in deemed capital contribution from our Chairman and CEO. These proceeds were partially offset by $23.3 million of reductions in notes payable related to the NaviNet acquisition, and $5.8 million payment to tax authorities on the employee's behalf to satisfy withholding requirements on income earned from vested shares.\nCash provided by financing activities of $171.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to $200.0 million in proceeds from an issuance of equity interests to Allscripts in addition to deemed capital contribution from our Chairman and CEO of $6.2 million. These proceeds were partially offset by $34.5 million payments of related party promissory notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities of $258.8 million consisted of $260.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of membership interests and $5.9 million in proceeds from related party promissory note offset in part by a $2.0 million in payments of notes payable.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt obligations, non-cancellable leases for our office space and certain equipment and vendor contracts to provide research services, and purchase obligations under license agreements and reseller agreements. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 in thousands:\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchasing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party promissory note\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party convertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other convertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases and capital leases obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Including capital lease obligation in an amount of $89 thousand for payment prior to one year subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nIn September 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Reseller Agreement, (\"Reseller Agreement\"), for genomic and proteomic sequencing services and related bioinformatics and analysis services with NantOmics, with an effective date of June\n- 117 -\n19, 2015. The Reseller Agreement has a contract period from June 2015 through December 31, 2020, subject to three potential three-year renewal options if we meet certain GPS Cancer thresholds. We agreed to pay NantOmics non-cancellable annual minimum fees of $2.0 million for each of the calendar years from 2016 through 2020, and subject to us exercising at least one of our renewal options, we are required to pay annual minimum fees to NantOmics of $25.0 million for each of the calendar years from 2021 through 2023 and $50.0 million per year for each of the calendar years from 2024 through 2029. We have the ability to terminate this agreement without cause. The Reseller Agreement permits us to use vendors other than NantOmics to provide any or all of the services that are currently being provided by NantOmics and clarifies that we are responsible for order fulfillment and branding.\nOn September 29, 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NorthShore University Health System, or NorthShore, to further develop their Health Heritage software platform, or Health Heritage, and to license the software to customers. As part of the agreement, we will pay NorthShore a one-time license fee of $5.0 million and minimum annual royalties of $750,000 for the first four years of the agreement. We will have no obligation to pay any additional royalties after seven years or once aggregate royalties reach $5.0 million.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn March 2017, a number of putative class action securities complaints were filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, naming as defendants the Company and certain of our executive officers and directors. The pending complaints are captioned Deora v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01825, Di Rienzo v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01912, and Shafik v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01940. Some of the complaints also name as defendants investment banks who were underwriters in our initial public offering. The complaints generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material misstatements and omissions concerning NantHealth's business, operations, and results. In particular, the complaints refer to an article in alleging that defendants misrepresented NantHealth's business with the University of Utah and donations to the university by non-profit entities associated with our founder Dr. Soon-Shiong. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief on behalf of putative classes of persons who purchased or acquired NantHealth securities in the IPO or on the open market from the time of the initial public offering through early March 2017. We believe that the claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. The monetary and other impact of this action may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise resolve this matter may be significant and divert management's attention. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in this lawsuit. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in this matter, we could be required to pay substantial amounts which might materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of accompanying Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee Note 21 of accompanying notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of related party transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n- 118 -\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock based compensation arrangements granted to employees in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation: Stock Compensation\u201d, by measuring the grant date fair value of the award and recognizing the resulting expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.\nWe account for stock based compensation arrangements issued to non-employees using the fair value approach prescribed by ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d. The value of non-employee stock based compensation is re-measured at the end of each reporting period until the award vests and is recognized as stock based compensation expense over the period during which the non-employee provides the services.\nStock based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate service period for awards that are only subject to service conditions and is recognized using the accelerated attribution method for awards that are subject to performance conditions. Stock based compensation expense is only recognized for awards subject to performance conditions if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.\nWe early adopted FASB ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d) related to stock based compensation, beginning July 1, 2016, simplifying the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. Per ASU 2016-09, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. We have elected to account for forfeitures when they occur. Cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity in the Statement of Cash Flows.\nSoftware Developed for Internal Use\nWe account for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with FASB ASC 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other \" (\"ASC 350\"). Computer software development costs are expensed as incurred, except for internal use software that qualify for capitalization as described below, and include employee related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses; costs of computer hardware and software; and costs incurred in developing features and functionality. These capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. We expense costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of software development and capitalizes costs incurred in the application development stage and costs associated with significant enhancements to existing internal use software applications. Software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years commencing when the software project is ready for its intended use.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services or products have been provided to the client, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. While most of the our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we on occasion provide payment terms to clients in excess of one year from the date of contract signing. We do not recognize revenue for arrangements containing these extended payment terms until such payments become due. Certain of our customer arrangements allow for termination for convenience with advanced notice. Such termination rights do not allow for refunds other than prepaid PCS or other services. These provisions do not affect the recognition of revenue. We also have certain arrangements which allow for termination and refunds of fees in the event that software acceptance by the customer has not occurred. In these instances, we will defer all revenue until software acceptance has occurred.\nThe sequencing and molecular analysis revenue is primarily generated from payments received from commercial third-party payors, hospitals and other provider networks and patients. We report revenue from arrangements with these customers on a gross basis in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations. We recognize revenue from these arrangements when all revenue recognition criteria have been met or on a cash basis when it cannot conclude that the fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We use judgment in our assessment of whether the fees are fixed or determinable and whether collectability is reasonably assured in determining when to recognize revenue in the future as it continues to gain payment experience with our customers. Accordingly, we expect to recognize revenue on a cash basis when we cannot conclude that the fees from a particular customer are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured until it has a sufficient history to reliably estimate payment patterns from such customer.\n- 119 -\nWe engage in various multiple-element arrangements, which may generate revenue across any of the sources noted above. For multiple-element software arrangements that involve the sale of our proprietary software, PCS, and other software-related services, VSOE of fair value is required to allocate and recognize revenue for each element. VSOE of fair value is determined based on the price charged in which each deliverable is sold separately. We have established VSOE for PCS on certain of our software solutions using the Stated Renewal Method. In this instance, we have determined that our stated renewals are substantive and appropriate for use in the Stated Renewal Method. We have not yet established VSOE of fair value for any element other than PCS for our arrangements. In situations where VSOE of fair value exists for PCS but not a delivered element (typically the software license and services elements), the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the undelivered element equal to its VSOE value with the remainder allocated to the delivered elements. In situations in which VSOE of fair value does not exist for all of the undelivered software-related elements, revenue is deferred until only one undelivered element remains (typically the PCS element) and then recognized following the pattern of delivery of the final undelivered element. Our multiple element arrangements typically provide for renewal of PCS terms upon expiration of the original term. The amounts of these PCS renewals are recognized as revenue ratably over the specified PCS renewal period.\nFor non-software arrangements that include multiple elements, primarily consisting of our SaaS agreements, revenue recognition involves the identification of separate units of accounting after consideration of combining and/or segmenting contracts and allocation of the arrangement consideration to the units of accounting on the basis of their relative selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on VSOE of fair value, if available, third party evidence, or TPE, of fair value if VSOE is not available, or our best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In determining the units of accounting for these arrangements, we evaluate whether each deliverable has standalone value as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance. Our SaaS arrangements are treated as a single unit of accounting as the professional services do not have standalone value. As a result, we recognize initial system implementation and deployment fees ratably over a period of time from when the system implementation or deployment services are completed and accepted by the customer over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated customer life. SaaS revenue consists of revenue earned from clients (typically on a monthly basis) for use of our subscription or license-based solutions and services. We recognize revenue from such contracts ratably over the contract period.\nIf an arrangement to deliver software requires significant production, modification or customization of the licensed software, we account for the arrangement as a construction-type contract. Currently we recognize revenue for these arrangements using the completed-contract method as it does not currently have sufficient information to reliably estimate the percentage of completion for these projects. We consider these arrangements to be substantially complete upon the clients' acceptance of the software and related professional services and consistently apply this policy to all contract accounting arrangements.\nTransaction processing fees are recognized on a monthly basis based on the number of transactions processed and the fee per transaction.\nRevenue derived from reseller arrangements is recognized when the resellers, in turn, sell the software solution to their clients and installation of the software solution has occurred, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. This is commonly referred to as the sell-through method and we defer recognition until there is a sell-through by the reseller to an actual end user clients and acceptance by the end user has occurred.\nProfits Interest Plan\nOn December 3, 2013, we adopted the Profits Interests Plan and reserved an aggregate of 63.8 million Series C units for issuance to our associates, consultants and contractors in consideration for bona fide services provided.\nThe Series C units were considered profits interests of us and did not entitle their holders (the \"Series C members\") to receive distributions if we were liquidated immediately after the grant. Instead, the Series C members were entitled to receive an allocation of a portion of our profits and losses arising after the date of the grant and, subject to vesting conditions, distributions made out of a portion of the our profits arising after the grant date of the Series C units. Grants of the Series C units were either fully vested, partially vested, or entirely unvested at the time of the grant as determined by the our Board of Directors.\nSeries C members were not entitled to receive any distributions until our aggregate distributions exceeded a hurdle amount applicable to those Series C units. The hurdle amount for each grant was determined by the Board of Directors at the date of issuance of such units. After all other members received their applicable hurdle amount, the Series C members were entitled to receive their percentage interest of such excess distributions.\n- 120 -\nPrior to the LLC Conversion on June 1, 2016, we had 3.5 million Series C units outstanding. Upon the LLC Conversion on June 1, 2016, we issued 28,973 shares of common stock to holders of vested Series C units and 10,462 shares of restricted stock to holders of unvested Series C units. The shares of restricted stock issued to holders of unvested profits interest are subject to forfeiture until becoming fully vested in accordance with the terms of the original Series C unit grant agreements.\nStock compensation expense for the Series C units/restricted stock issued to the nonemployees is calculated based on the fair value of the aware on each balance sheet date and the attribution of that cost is being recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nPhantom Unit Plan\nOn March 31, 2015, we approved the Phantom Unit Plan. The maximum number of phantom units that may be issued under the Phantom Unit Plan is equal to 11.6 million minus the number of issued and outstanding Series C units. As of December 31, 2016, we had 4.3 million phantom units outstanding under the Phantom Unit Plan. Each grant of phantom units made to a participant under the Phantom Unit Plan vests over a defined service period, subject to completion of a liquidity event, and is subject to forfeiture upon termination of the participant's continuous service to us for any reason. Our IPO satisfied the liquidity event condition, and the phantom units now entitle their holders to cash or non-cash payments in an amount equal to the number of vested units held by that participant multiplied by the fair market value of our common stock, as determined by our board of directors.\nWe intend to settle all vested phantom unit payments held by United States-based participants in shares of our common stock and classified these awards as equity awards in our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet. Awards held by participants who are based outside of the United States will be settled in cash and are classified within accrued expenses on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. In order to satisfy payroll withholding tax obligations triggered by the issuance of shares of common stock to holders of vested phantom units, we issue recipients a net lower number of shares of common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations, and remitted a cash payment for the related withholding taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 1.1 million shares of common stock, after withholding 0.5 million shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. We made a cash payment of $5.8 million to cover employee withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes upon the settlement of these vested phantom units. We also paid $0.2 million to cash-settle 17 thousand vested phantom units held by participants of the Phantom Unit Plan based outside of the United States.\nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards\nWe had federal, state and foreign income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $238.9 million, $169.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, available to offset taxable income in tax year 2017 and thereafter. The federal NOL's will start to expire in year 2023.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that we have recently undergone one or more ownership changes. The above NOL amounts do not include the NOLs expected to expire before they can be utilized under Section 382.\nThe occurrence of such ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and possibly other tax attributes. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect. Any further ownership change also could cause such NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unused, thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows.\nIn addition, we may determine that varying state laws with respect to NOL utilization may result in lower limits, or an inability to utilize NOLs in some states altogether, which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes. In the event that state law results in lower limits, or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards, or we become subject to federal alternative minimum tax, this could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the\n- 121 -\npurchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We routinely monitor the factors impacting the acquired assets and liabilities. Transaction related costs are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or between annual tests when an impairment indicator exists. In the event there is a change in reporting units or segments, we will test for impairment at the reporting unit. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nAs part of the annual impairment test, we may conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets.\nIf an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. If a reporting unit's fair value is lower than its carrying value, we must determine the amount of implied goodwill that would be established if the reporting unit was hypothetically acquired on the impairment test date. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the amount of implied goodwill, we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess.\nThe determination of fair value of a reporting unit is based on a combination of a market approach that considers benchmark company market multiples and an income approach that uses discounted cash flows for each reporting unit utilizing Level 3 inputs. Under the income approach, we determine the fair value based on the present value of the most recent income projections for each reporting unit and calculates a terminal value utilizing a terminal growth rate. The significant assumptions under this approach include, among others: income projections, which are dependent on sales to new and existing clients, new solution introductions, client behavior, competitor pricing, operating expenses, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The cash flows used to determine fair value are dependent on a number of significant management assumptions based on historical experience, expectations of future performance, and the expected economic environment. Estimates are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future results. Additionally, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate are based on judgment of the rates that would be utilized by a hypothetical market participant.\nAccounting guidance requires that definite-lived intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets and ratably amortize the value over the estimated useful lives of those assets. If the estimates of the useful lives change, we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives or, if an asset is deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the value of the asset to its fair value may be required at such time.\nInvestment in Related Party\nInvestment in and advances to a related party in which we have a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20% to 50%, or for which we exercise significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. An investment in a limited liability company that is similar to partnership is also accounted for under the equity method if more than minor influence over the operation of the investee exists (generally through more than 3-5% ownership). As part of that accounting, we recognize gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by a related party that results in changes in the proportionate share of the dollar amount of the related party's equity.\n- 122 -\nThe investment in related party is assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net loss. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee's financial performance, and our ability and intention to retain the investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment's market value. The new cost basis of the investment is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nThe fair value of its equity method investment would be determined using the income approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. The related cash flow forecasts are discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital at the date of valuation.\nDifferences between the carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the related party are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on our analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, our share of the related party's reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the related party's historical book values.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nWe have classified the interest make-whole provision of our convertible notes due 2021 issued in December 2016 as a derivative liability that is recorded at fair value. This derivative liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. The change in the fair value of this derivative liability of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due primarily to the change in the value of our common stock from the date of issuance of our convertible notes to December 31, 2016.\nIncome taxes\nFASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ( Topic 740 \u201d) provides the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognizing, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including taking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided to us by our tax advisers, our legal advisers and similar tax cases. If at a later time our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or decrease.\n- 123 -\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company,\u201d we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act, including those relating to (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC with at least $700 million of outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years, or (iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\u201d and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs, assumptions, and information currently available to our management, and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, those described in greater detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company focused on enabling our clients to fundamentally change the diagnosis, treatment and pharmacoeconomics of cancer and other critical illnesses. We believe a molecular-driven, systems-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on large-scale, real time biometric and phenotypical data will become the standard of care initially for patients with cancer and, ultimately, other critical illnesses. We derive revenue from selling GPS Cancer (our Genomic Proteomic Spectrometry Cancer test, a unique, comprehensive molecular test and decision support solution that measures the proteins present in the patient's tumor tissue, combined with whole genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of tumor & normal samples), to which we obtained exclusive access from an affiliate, and NantOS and NantOS apps to healthcare providers and payors, self-insured employers and biopharmaceutical companies. NantOS and NantOS apps include proprietary methods and algorithms for enabling healthcare providers to make better treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes and lower the cost of care, and allow healthcare payors to ensure that their dependents receive high quality care in a cost-effective manner. We believe that as healthcare providers and payors migrate to value-based reimbursement models and implement advances in precision medicine, our offerings position us at the forefront of multiple significant market opportunities.\nWe market NantHealth solutions (which was originally introduced to the market as CLINICS) as a comprehensive integrated solution that includes GPS Cancer, NantOS and the NantOS apps. We also market our GPS Cancer, NantOS, individual NantOS apps and suites of NantOS apps as stand-alone solutions. To accelerate our commercial growth and enhance our competitive advantage, we continue to:\n \u2022 introduce new marketing, education and engagement efforts and foster relationships across the oncology community to drive adoption of GPS Cancer; \n \u2022 pursue reimbursement of GPS Cancer from regional and national third-party payors and government payors and self-insured employers; \n \u2022 publish scientific and medical advances; \n \u2022 strengthen our commercial organization to increase our NantHealth solutions client base and to broaden usage of our solutions by existing clients who currently use only NantOS, specific NantOS apps or suites of NantOS apps; and \n \u2022 develop new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions to address the needs of current and future healthcare provider and payor, self-insured employer and biopharmaceutical company clients.  Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of NantHealth solutions, including NantOS and the NantOS apps, as well as the commercial launch of our GPS Cancer business. To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and as of December 31, 2016 our accumulated deficit was approximately $475.3 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses over the near term as we drive adoption of GPS Cancer, expand our commercial operations, and invest further in NantHealth solutions.\n- 98 -\nWe plan to (i) continue investing in our infrastructure, including but not limited to solution development, sales and marketing, implementation and support, (ii) continue efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline, (iii) add new clients through maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and solution development activities, (iv) expand our relationships with existing clients through delivery of add-on and complementary solutions and services and (v) continue our commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs. We believe that our growing client base using our NantOS and NantOS apps on a daily basis is a strategic asset, and we intend to expand sales of NantHealth solutions offerings towards this client base in order to leverage this strategic asset.\nRecent Developments\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed our IPO, whereby we sold 6,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. Additionally, on June 9, 2016, the underwriters partially exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional 400,000 shares of our common stock at $14.00 per share.\nWe received a total of $83.6 million in net proceeds from our IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $13.0 million. The offering was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-211196), as amended.\nIn December 2016, we issued convertible notes to a related party and others for net proceeds of $9.9 million and $92.8 million, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $4.2 million. Please see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these convertible notes.\nRecent Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have made several significant acquisitions and investments in 2014, 2015 and 2016, which have expanded the features and functionality of NantHealth solutions, including the following:\n \u2022 NDO In June 2014, we acquired NDO, which provides healthcare interoperability and informatics solutions through its cOS platform to address population health issues. Our results of operations include the impact of the NDO acquisition as of June 2014. \n \u2022 NantOmics In June 2015, we invested a substantial portion of our available capital in NantOmics, a majority owned subsidiary of NantWorks. Our investment represents approximately 14.3% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of NantOmics. Our relationship with NantOmics provides us with access to what we believe is the nation's only CAP- and CLIA-certified whole genome and quantitative proteomics laboratory. \n \u2022 Healthcare Solutions ( HCS\u201d) In July 2015, we acquired certain assets related to HCS business from Harris Corporation. We believe the acquired assets will help complex healthcare delivery organizations achieve better patient outcomes, clinical and administrative workflow efficiency and stronger collaboration across the continuum of care. \n \u2022 NaviNet In January 2016, we acquired NaviNet, which provides a secure collaboration network connecting approximately 36 health plans and which is estimated to be utilized in more than 70% of the nation's physicians' offices during the fourth quarter of 2016. NaviNet Open will serve as a nationwide scalable and secure web-based portal for patients and providers.  Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share\nAdjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Our management believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance, because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for our core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for our core business between current, past and future periods . Other companies may define these measures in different ways. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All loss per share numbers contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated based on one class of common stock and do not incorporate the effects, if any, of using the two-class method.\n- 99 -\nAdjusted net loss excludes the effects of (1) loss from equity method investments, (2) stock based compensation expense, (3) intangible amortization, (4) corporate restructuring expenses, (5) BP settlement other income, (6) acquisition related compensation expense, (7) acquisition-related sales incentives, which have been recorded as contra revenue, (8) change in fair value of derivatives liability, (9) non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, and (10) Benefit for (provision from) income taxes adjustment includes the impact of the conversion from a limited liability corporation to a corporation, the impact of convertible notes offering and the impact of intangibles amortization.\nAdjusted shares outstanding include Series F redeemable shares as if converted on January 1, 2014.\nThe following table reconciles Net loss to Net loss per share - Non-GAAP and Shares outstanding to Shares outstanding-Non-GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n- 100 -\nThe following table reconciles Net loss per share to Net loss per share Non-GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\n (1) The net loss per share - non-GAAP, weighted-average shares outstanding, weighted average Series F units/redeemable stock and shares outstanding - non-GAAP, have been computed to give effect to the LLC conversion that occurred June 1, 2016 prior to our initial public offering. In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, (a) all of our outstanding units automatically converted into shares of common stock, based on the relative rights of our pre-IPO equityholders as set forth in the limited liability company agreement and (b) we adopted and filed a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware and adopted bylaws. We filed an amended certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-5.5 reverse stock split of our common stock on June 1, 2016. Please see Note 18 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the LLC conversion and related transactions. \n (2) The weighted-average shares outstanding have been further adjusted to account for the redeemable Series F units (converted to common stock in conjunction with the LLC conversion), whose put right expired on June 20, 2016. Prior to June 20, 2016, these units/shares of common stock were classified as redeemable members'/stockholders' equity in the balance sheet, and as such, were not included in the weighted-average shares outstanding prior to June 20, 2016. The put right expired June 20, 2016, and the shares were no longer redeemable and are included in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2016. The weighted-average shares are adjusted to include the redeemable common stock in the weighted-average shares outstanding for the entire period. Please see Note 18 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the LLC conversion and related transactions.  Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate our revenue from the sale of licensed software, maintenance, software-as-a-service, hardware and services. Our Systems Infrastructure and platforms support the delivery of both personalized comprehensive sequencing and molecular analysis and the implementation of value-based care models across the healthcare continuum. We generate revenue from the following sources:\n- 101 -\nSoftware, middleware and hardware - Software, middleware and hardware revenue is generated from the sale of NantOS and NantOS apps software on either a perpetual or term license basis, and the sale of our hardware. The software is installed on the client's site or the client's designated vendor's site and is not hosted by us or by a vendor contracted by us. We also generate revenue from the resale of third-party software and hardware to our clients. Our software and hardware solutions sold include components of our NantOS, including FusionFX, cOS, DeviceConX and HBox.\nSoftware-as-a-service - Software-as-a-service, or SaaS, revenue is generated from our clients' access to and usage of our hosted software solutions on a subscription basis for a specified contract term, which is typically annually. In our SaaS arrangements, the client cannot take possession of the software during the term of the contract and generally only has the right to access and use the software and receive any software upgrades published during the subscription period. Solutions sold under a SaaS model include our eviti platform solutions,NantOS and NantOS apps. SaaS revenue may include hosting of our software solutions on behalf of the client.\nMaintenance - Maintenance revenue includes ongoing post-contract client support, or PCS, or maintenance during the paid PCS term. Additionally, PCS includes ongoing development of software updates and upgrades provided to the client on a when and if available basis. We sell NantOS, including DeviceConX and FusionFX, with maintenance contracts.\nSequencing and molecular analysis - Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue is generated by the process of performing sequencing and analysis of whole genome DNA, RNA and proteomic results, including GPS Cancer. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of the analysis and reporting of the results to the client or on a cash basis when it cannot conclude that the fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nOther services - Other services revenue includes revenue from professional services we provide that are generally complementary to our software solutions and may or may not be required for the solution to function as desired by the client. When associated with software, there services are generally provided in the form of training and implementation services during the software license period and do not include PCS. Other services revenue also includes revenue related to nursing and therapy services provided to patients in a home care setting and any other services not included in the preceding revenue sources.\nWe have established VSOE for PCS on certain of our software solutions. We have not yet established VSOE of fair value for any element other than PCS for a portion of our arrangements. In situations where VSOE of fair value exists for PCS but not a delivered element, the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the undelivered element equal to our VSOE value with the remainder allocated to the delivered elements. In situations where our services are essential to the functionality of our software and VSOE of fair value for PCS does not exist, we defer revenue and costs until we have delivered all elements of the arrangement and amortize revenue and costs over the initial PCS period. For our contracts with multiple elements, we defer revenue until only one undelivered element remains and then recognize the revenue following the pattern of delivery of the final undelivered element. The timing and pattern of this revenue recognition can cause variations in revenue from period-to-period.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs for associates providing services to our clients and supporting our revenue-generating platform infrastructure, including salaries, benefits and bonuses. Additional expenses include consultant costs, direct reimbursable travel expenses and other direct engagement costs associated with the design, development, sale and installation of our solutions, including system support and maintenance services. Our cost of revenue associated with each of our revenue sources is as follows:\n \u25aa Software, middleware and hardware - Software and hardware cost of revenue includes third-party software and hardware costs directly associated with our solutions. \n \u25aa Software-as-a-service - SaaS cost of revenue includes personnel-related, amortization of deferred implementation costs and other direct costs associated with the delivery and hosting of NantOS and NantOS apps, including eviti, our cancer-decision support solution, and NaviNet on a subscription basis. \n \u25aa Maintenance - Maintenance cost of revenue includes personnel-related and other direct costs associated with the ongoing support or maintenance we provide for our clients. \n \u25aa Sequencing and molecular analysis - Sequencing and molecular analysis cost of revenue includes internal costs associated with these services and amounts due to NantOmics under our Reseller Agreement for the sequencing and analysis of whole genome, DNA, RNA and proteomic results. \n- 102 -\n \u25aa Other services - Other services cost of revenue includes personnel-related costs, amortization of deferred implementation costs and other direct costs associated with software training and implementation services provided to our clients as well as direct expenses relating to our nursing and therapy services provided to patients in a home care setting.  Cost of revenue also includes amortization of our developed technologies used to generate revenue. We plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. We expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we expand NantHealth solutions and realize economies of scale.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative, research and development, and amortization of software license and acquisition-related assets.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of shared service fees from NantWorks, personnel-related expenses for our sales and marketing, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative associates, stock based compensation, and advertising and marketing promotions of NantHealth solutions. It also includes trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, point of purchase display expenses and related amortization as well as legal costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate and administrative costs.\nWith the exception of stock based compensation, we expect our selling, general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to attract new clients, broaden usage of our solutions by existing clients, and expand our brand. Additionally, we expect to incur additional costs for legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with operating as a public company. These increases include additional costs we expect to incur associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies as well as increased costs for directors' and officers' liability insurance and an enhanced investor relations function. However, we expect our selling, general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as our revenue increases and we realize economies of scale.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for associates working on development of solutions, including salaries, benefits and stock based compensation. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees to third-party development resources.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new software solutions and improving our existing software solutions. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred as the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of software solutions for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWith the exception of stock based compensation, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the short term as we continue to make significant investments in developing new solutions and enhancing the functionality of our existing solutions. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we realize economies of scale from our developed technology.\nAmortization of Software License and Acquisition Related Assets\nAmortization of software license and acquisition related assets consists of non-cash amortization expense related to our non-revenue generating technology as well as amortization expense that we recognize on intangible assets that we acquired through our investments.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net primarily consists of interest expense associated with our outstanding borrowings offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n- 103 -\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of unrealized and realized gains (losses) on and dividends received from our marketable securities and other non-recurring items.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Method Investments\nIncome (Loss) from equity method investments consists of our pro rata share of income and losses of a company that we own an ownership interest in and account for under the equity method of accounting.\nWe regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other than temporary impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state and foreign income taxes. To date, we have no significant U.S. federal, state and foreign cash income taxes because of our LLC status prior to June 1, 2016 and current and accumulated net operating losses.\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all the available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\n- 104 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations data for each of the periods indicated:\n\n- 105 -\n (1) The net income (loss) per share and weighted-average shares outstanding have been computed to give effect to the LLC Conversion that occurred June 1, 2016 prior to our initial public offering. In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, (a) all of our outstanding units automatically converted into shares of common stock, based on the relative rights of our pre-IPO equityholders as set forth in the limited liability company agreement and (b) we adopted and filed a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware and adopted bylaws. We filed an amended certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-5.5 reverse stock split of our common stock on June 1, 2016. \n (2) The net income (loss) per share for the common stock for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 reflects $4,958 and $16,042 in accretion value allocated to the redeemable common stock, respectively. The redeemable common stock contained a put right, which expired unexercised on June 20, 2016. As a result of and as of that date, the shares were no longer redeemable and were included in common stock.  The following table sets forth our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\n\n- 106 -\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016\nRevenue\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nTotal revenue increased $42.1 million or 72.2% from $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our total revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and from our acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016. Our acquisition of certain assets of HCS resulted in the contribution of $19.2 million in primarily maintenance, SaaS, and other services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to approximately $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our acquisition of NaviNet resulted in the contribution of $40.8 million mainly in SaaS revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe that a significant opportunity exists to expand sequencing and molecular analysis revenue as we expand both the number of GPS profiles delivered as well as obtaining additional insurance reimbursement for our GPS profile.\nTotal software-related revenue was $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $31.3 million or 88.4%. Our total software-related revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and from the acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016. We also experienced growth in our Nant OS cancer decision support revenue from expansion in our customer base for those products. These increases were partially offset by a $11.6 million decrease in software and hardware revenue recognized from completed implementations of our DeviceConX, as well as decreases in our NantOS Interoperability (formerly cOS) platforms compared to the same period in the prior year. Software related revenue in the prior year ended December 31, 2015 included recognition of revenue from certain large DeviceConX arrangements which had been previously deferred pending completion of implementation.\nSoftware and hardware revenue decreased $6.4 million or 43.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to a decreased amount of completed DeviceConX implementations. Software and hardware revenue attributed to NantOS DeviceConX is recognized upon the completion of each implementation. A decline of $7.2 million was attributable to a reduction in the number of completed large implementations during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease was offset by a $1.0 million incremental increase as a result of the HCS acquisition. In 2015, there were more projects in excess of $1.0 million dollars in contract value completed compared with to 2016. We believe opportunities exist to grow software and hardware revenue through completion of both existing implementations as well as executing new sales bookings from our pipeline of opportunities.\nSaaS revenue was $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $37.6 million or 181.5% from $20.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by increased NantOS revenue including $1.0 million of FusionFX revenue acquired with the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and revenue of $41.0 million from the acquisition of NaviNet in January 2016 in connection with SaaS revenue. In addition, revenue from our NantOS cancer decision support (formerly Eviti) platform solutions increased $1.5 million, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in revenue from other NantOS Interoperability platforms.\nMaintenance revenue increased $3.8 million or 36.2% from $10.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015. Acquired NantOS (formerly Harris HCS) maintenance customers contributed to an increase of $3.9 million in maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n- 107 -\nSequencing and molecular analysis revenue during the period included revenue recognized for GPS profiles for which fees are fixed and determinable under a payor agreement as well as what was recognized on a cash basis due to uncertainty over reimbursement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $0.6 million in sequencing and molecular analysis revenue. There are significant opportunities going forward as we gain momentum in gaining coverage in the US with commercial health plans and self-insured employers and globally with supplemental benefits insurers, while at the same time building GPS adoption among oncologists, including the community and academic institutions.\nWe are aggressively expanding our sales efforts by adding seasoned sales and account management professionals in 2017. The commercial team's efforts are focused around the development of pilots with commercial insurance payers who would agree to pay for a certain number of GPS profiles, aligned with designated provider groups who will order the GPS test, and reimbursement is recognized. The pipeline of pilot opportunities going into 2017 is in excess of $10.0 million dollars. Our pipeline of self-insured employers includes opportunities with many companies listed on Fortune's 100, as well as an alliance of 50 of the largest employers in the US. Most recently, we announced a partnership with the International Association of Firefighters, which is significant not only because of its size, but because its incidence of cancer is much greater than the average population, and in 37 states, there are presumptive laws around job related cancer for firefighters, which has opened discussions for us related to worker's compensation as well.\nOther services revenue increased $6.5 million or 52.4% from $12.4 million in 2015 to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily driven by the completion of a large NantOS Interoperability (formerly Harris HCS) software related services project which contributed to NantOS interoperability services revenue growth of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and incremental growth of $0.2 million from the NaviNet acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease of NantOS DeviceConX solutions due to a decline in the number of completed large projects.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-sell opportunities of our suite of solutions across our existing customer base, including the recently acquired HCS FusionFX and NaviNet customer bases. We are also integrating the cOS, FusionFX and NaviNet product solutions, within our NantOS platform, and believe that opportunities exist to cross-sell this combination of solutions to existing former HCS, FusionFX and NaviNet customers as well as to new customers. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS sequencing analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future maintenance and SaaS recurring revenue streams.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nTotal revenue increased $24.4 million, or 71.9%, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our total revenue growth came in all of our revenue categories and was driven primarily by growth in our existing solutions including NantOS (DeviceConX and cOS), eviti and sequencing and molecular analysis, as well as our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015. Our acquisition of certain assets of HCS resulted in the contribution of $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.9 million in SaaS, maintenance and other services revenue, respectively, for the year ended 2015.\nOur total software-related revenue (including software, hardware, and SaaS) increased to $35.4 million for 2015 from $18.2 million for 2014, an increase of $17.2 million, or 94.8%. This growth came primarily from growth in revenue from our NantOS (DeviceConX and cOS) and eviti solutions, as well as our acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015.\nSoftware and hardware revenue increased to $14.6 million for 2015 from $8.4 million for the year ended 2014, an increase of $6.2 million, or 74.6%. This growth was primarily driven by an increased amount of completed NantOS component DeviceConX implementations. Software and hardware revenue attributed to DeviceConX is recognized upon the completion of each implementation.\nSaaS revenue increased to $20.7 million for 2015 from $9.8 million for the year ended 2014, an increase of $11.0 million, or 112.0%. This increase was primarily driven by increased NantOS sales (including our Fusion family of products, or Fusion), revenue acquired with the acquisition of HCS assets in July 2015 and eviti platform revenue. eviti platform revenue grew to approximately $13.9 million for 2015 from $8.9 million for 2014, an increase of $5.0 million, or 56%. eviti revenue growth was primarily driven by an expansion in volume with our existing payor customer base. cOS revenue included under SaaS was positively impacted by the recognition of $4.7 million in previously deferred revenue related to a client arrangement which ended in 2015. Finally, we recognized approximately $0.9 million in acquired Fusion SaaS revenue for 2015.\nMaintenance revenue increased to $10.5 million for 2015 from $5.3 million for 2014, an increase of $5.1 million, or 95.5%. Maintenance revenue growth was primarily driven by both an increase in customer base of DeviceConX as a result of completed implementations as well as acquired Fusion maintenance customers which contributed approximately $1.1 million in maintenance revenue for 2015.\n- 108 -\nThe increase in other services revenue of $2.0 million for December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by both the increase in the number of completed DeviceConX implementations as well as higher volume in our home healthcare business, or Assisteo. Our Assisteo home healthcare business benefited from an expanded relationship with a skilled nursing facility in 2015.\nWe expected to launch our commercial sequencing and molecular analysis solution, or GPS Cancer, in the second quarter of 2016. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement to provide certain research related sequencing services to a research institution. The agreement provides that the institution pay us $10.0 million in exchange for our providing sequencing services through our reseller agreement with NantOmics. In 2015, we provided $6.2 million of services, which has been recorded as a deemed capital contribution instead of revenue. At the institution's request, certain non-profit organizations provided partial funding for the sequencing and related bioinformatics costs associated with the project. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a member of the board of directors of, and may have significant influence or control over, these organizations. The institution was not contractually or otherwise required to use our molecular profiling solution or any of our other products or services as part of the charitable gift. In 2016, we completed another $3.8 million in services, which was recorded as deemed capital contributions.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-sell opportunities of our suite of solutions across our existing customer base including the recently acquired HCS and Fusion customer bases. We are also integrating the cOS, Fusion and NaviNet and believe that opportunities exist to cross sell this to existing Fusion and NaviNet customers as well as to new customers. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS sequencing analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future maintenance and SaaS recurring revenue streams.\nCost of Revenue\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nCost of revenue increased $37.5 million, or 107.8% from $34.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenue increased across all categories primarily as a result of acquisitions of HCS and NaviNet ($22.9 million). Additionally, we incurred $8.4 million of stock compensation expenses in the year period ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero in 2015.\nTotal software-related cost of revenue increased $19.4 million or 273.4% from $7.1 million in 2015 to $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers were the acquisitions of HCS and NaviNet which contributed increases of $0.7 million and $13.9 million respectively. Additionally, the Company has incurred $4.5 million of stock compensation expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016 versus zero in the same period last year.\nSequencing and molecular analysis increased $1.9 million or 4,994.9% from $0.04 million in 2015 compared to $2.0 million in 2016. We record the cost of revenue expense upon delivery of the GPS report to our clients. As a result, there will be a timing difference between the revenue recorded and the cost of revenue recorded. In addition, the cost of revenue is recorded as defined by the applicable contract with our clients and as outlined in the amended and restated Reseller Agreement for genomic and proteomic sequencing services and related bioinformatics and analysis services with NantOmics.\n- 109 -\nWe believe that there are significant opportunities going forward to grow the volume of sequencing and molecular analysis activity which would increase the associated costs of delivering such revenue. We record the cost of revenue expense upon delivery of the GPS report to our clients. There may be a timing difference between the revenue recorded and the cost of revenue recorded in the event that revenue recognition is delayed. Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue in the current period was limited to what could be recognized on a cash basis due to uncertainty over reimbursement for the GPS profiles delivered in the period. As we gain additional insurance coverage and reimbursement experience, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of GPS revenue which is recognized on a cash basis.\nOther services cost of revenue increased $10.3 million or 67.5% from $15.2 million in 2015 to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers were an incremental increase of $8.0 million as a result of the acquisition of HCS as well as an increase of $4.4 million in our NantOS Interoperability and Home Health Services lines of businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in cost of revenue associated with sequencing services provided to a research institution, as well as a decrease of $0.7 million in DeviceConX solutions due to a decline in the number of completed large projects.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nTotal cost of revenue increased $10.6 million, or 43.7%, from $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of an $8.2 million increase in our other services cost of revenue and a $2.9 million increase in our amortization of developed technologies, compared to 2014. The increase in total cost of revenue was partially offset by a decline in costs for software-related revenue of $1.9 million.\nThe $8.2 million increase in other services cost of revenue referenced above was primarily due to $3.7 million in amounts owed to NantOmics related to sequencing and molecular analysis performed for a research institution, incremental costs associated with the newly-acquired Fusion product revenue, and costs related to business expansion of our home health business for the year ended 2015. The increase in the amortization of developed technologies cost of revenue is due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition of HCS and full calendar year of amortization in 2015 versus a partial year of amortization in 2014 for the acquisition of NDO.\nThe $1.9 million reduction in total software-related cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a reduction in costs associated with certain cOS projects in 2015 versus 2014 as well as a reduction in certain hardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million or 74.8% from $69.0 million in 2015 to $120.7 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to $27.7 million increase in stock compensation expenses in connection with the vesting of phantom units upon consummation of our IPO and an increase of $9.0 million in personnel related expenses, a $6.3 million increase in professional services as well as selling and marketing expenses in connection with the growth of the business, $4.9 million due to increased investments in information technology and depreciation and amortization expenses as we invest in assets to support future growth. The balance is due to an increase in general overhead expenses as well as acquisition related expenses. We expect to continue to invest in opportunities to grow our molecular sequencing and analysis and other solutions which includes increased investments in sales and marketing activities.\n- 110 -\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.8 million, or 49.4%, from $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was driven in part by a $8.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a higher headcount, including increased costs associated with severance pay, bonus accruals and stock-based compensation expense. In addition, in 2015, we experienced an increase of an additional $9.6 million of expenses related to the acquisition of HCS (of which approximately $1.5 million was one-time in nature), a $3.6 million increase in professional services and internal information technology resources related expenses, and $1.5 million increase in other expenses, including a donation to support an academic cancer research center in the United Kingdom.\nResearch and Development\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nResearch and development expenses increased $37.8 million or 158.6%, from $23.8 million in 2015 to $61.6 million in 2016. This increase was driven by an increase of $16.4 million in stock compensation expense in connection with the vesting of equity awards upon the consummation of our IPO and Series C/restricted stock vesting, as well as the inclusion of research and development expenses of HCS and NaviNet. Specifically, we had $16.3 million due to an increase in personnel related expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in investments in information technology as we invest in assets to support future growth. In addition, we saw a $1.2 million increase in professional services expenses in connection with the growth of the business. Finally, we saw a $0.7 million increase in research and development general overhead expenses due to timing of certain research and development projects as well as the inclusion of research and development expenses of NaviNet. We expect to continue to invest in opportunities to leverage our solutions towards growth in our molecular sequencing and analysis and other solutions revenue.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.9 million, or 40.4%, from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by $4.7 million of expense related to the HCS acquisition in July 2015, and a $2.1 million increase due to higher headcount and associated personnel-related expenses as we invested in the development of our software and hardware solutions.\nInterest Expense, Net\n\nIn December 2016, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $107 million of our 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the \"Convertible Notes\") in a private placement offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, of which $10 million were issued to related party. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2021 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes. Please see the section entitled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 12 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the Convertible Notes.\n- 111 -\nIn January 2016, we executed a demand promissory note with NantCapital (the \"NantCapital Note\"), a personal investment vehicle for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a promissory note with NantOmics (the \"NantOmics Note\"). Through December 31, 2016, the total advances made by NantCapital and NantOmics to us pursuant to each applicable note amounted to approximately $112.7 million and $40.0 million, respectively. We can request additional advances subject to NantCapital and NantOmics approval. Each note bears interest at a per annum rate of 5.0% compounded annually and computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the year.\nIn May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. On December 15, 2016, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated May 9, 2016, between us and NantCapital, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note to June 30, 2022 and to subordinate the Promissory Note in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. In addition, in May 2016, the NantOmics Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest would be converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price at the time of pricing of the IPO. Later in May 2016, the NantOmics Note was further amended and restated to remove the automatic conversion feature and to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. In June 2016, the NantOmics Note was further amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest will be converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price after the pricing of the IPO and after the LLC Conversion. The NantOmics Note and all related accrued interest was converted on June 1, 2016 into 2,899,297 shares of our common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, there were no unpaid amounts related to the advances on the NantOmics Note. Please see the section entitled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 19 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these notes.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nInterest expense, net, increased by $5.7 million, from $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in interest expense, net, was due to the accrual of interest under the Convertible Notes, the NantOmics Note and the NantCapital Note.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nInterest expense, net decreased $0.4 million, or 36.0%, from $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the repayment of related party promissory notes on June 30, 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), net\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nOther income (expense), net, decreased by $0.6 million, from $2.5 million other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.9 million other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the year ended December 31, 2015, other income of $2.5 million was primarily derived from the dividend income and fair value adjustment from marketable securities. These marketable securities were liquidated or transferred to fund acquisitions and business operations. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we wrote off a short term note of $0.5 million with a vendor. There were no comparable write offs during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining balance was primarily due to expenses related to currency fluctuations.\n- 112 -\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a reduction in fair value of derivatives liability of $1.2 million, related to the convertible notes interest make-whole issued in December 2016. Also in November 2016, as one of the claimants in a class action lawsuit against BP p.l.c., and its related entities ( BP\u201d) regarding the Deepwater Horizon Incident, we entered into a settlement agreement with B.P. Exploration & Production, Inc. whereby in exchange for a $1.0 million monetary settlement we released BP from claims relating to the Deepwater Horizon Incident. In January 2017, the final distribution sheet was received and executed from BP's counsel in Alabama including information related to the gross $1.0 million settlement amount mentioned above and total $0.2 million expenses incurred related to the settlement agreement, resulting in a net settlement receivable of $0.8 million booked as Other income on our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nOther income (expense), net increased $3.0 million, from expense of $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to income of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This change was primarily attributable to the $2.3 million of dividend and interest income received from our marketable securities, $0.5 million from the write-off of short term notes payable and $0.2 million reimbursement from NantWorks for services provided by NantHealth associates in 2015.\nIncome (Loss) from Related Party Equity Method Investments\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from equity method investments increased $38.4 million compared with the same period of the prior year, from 2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $41.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our loss from equity investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $29.8 million non-cash impairment charge as a result of our determination that the fair value of our investment in NantOmics had declined below our carrying value as of December 31, 2016, and that this decline in value was other than temporary. The decline in the fair value of our investment in NantOmics was primarily caused by a change in the risk profile of our financial projections for NantOmics resulting from the delay in our GPS revenue growth.\nThe increase in loss from equity method investments was due to the impairment mentioned above, our pro rata share of losses from our investment in NantOmics, and the amortization of the basis difference in the investment. We report our share of NantOmics' loss and the amortization of basis difference using a one quarter lag.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments decreased $4.1 million, from income of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to a loss of $2.6 million during the year December 31, 2015. In 2014, we had income primarily attributable to an increase in our pro rata share of income from our investment in NantPharma LLC, or NantPharma, of $1.7 million. We sold our interest in NantPharma during May 2014. In 2015, we recorded pro rata share of losses from our investment in NantOmics.\n- 113 -\nProvision for (Benefits from) Income taxes\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the benefit from income taxes was $22.8 million, compared with a $0.4 million provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a benefit from income taxes in the amount of $8.7 million arising from a deferred tax asset valuation allowance release due to the LLC conversion to a C corporation and forming a federal tax consolidated group. The deferred tax liability previously recorded in purchase accounting of NaviNet became a source of income for the valuation allowance release.\nWe also recorded in 2016 an income tax benefit in the amount of $8.6 million, arising from the recording of a deferred tax expense in additional paid in capital due to the convertible notes conversion option recorded to equity. The remaining income tax benefit mainly results from amortization of purchase accounting intangibles.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the provision for income taxes was $0.4 million, compared to $0.01 million income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $160.4 million, compared to $7.2 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $3.0 million and $0.6 million , respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and our ability to borrow from affiliated entities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity, through one or more follow-on public offerings or in separate financings, or sell additional debt securities or obtain a credit facility. Further, because of the risk and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of our existing products as well as products in development, we may need additional funds to meet our needs sooner than planned. To date, our primary sources of capital were private placements of preferred stock, debt financing agreements, including the NantCapital Note, our IPO and the Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (\"the Convertible Notes\").\nConvertible Notes\nIn December 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Jefferies LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers\u201d), to issue and sell $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In December 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Cambridge Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Cambridge Equities, L.P., an entity affiliated with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ( Cambridge\u201d), to issue and sell $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In December 2016, pursuant to the exercise of the overallotment by the Initial Purchasers, we issued an additional $7.0 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately $102.7 million, comprised of $9.9 million from Cambridge and $92.8 million from the Initial Purchasers, after deducting of Initial Purchasers' discount and debt issuance costs of $4.3 million in connection with the Convertible Notes offering.\n- 114 -\nOn December 21, 2016, we entered into an Indenture, relating to the issuance of the Convertible Notes (the Indenture\u201d), by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee\u201d). The interest rates are fixed at 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2021, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted pursuant to their terms. The initial conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is 82.3893 shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $12.14 per share). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2021, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, the last reported sale price of our common stock on such trading day is greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price on such trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which, for each day of that period, the trading price per $1 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes will be settled in cash, shares of the Company's common stock or any combination thereof at our option.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes in principal amounts of $1 thousand or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nNantCapital Note\nIn January 2016, we issued the NantCapital Note to NantCapital, a personal investment vehicle for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, our Chairman and CEO, and the NantOmics Note to NantOmics. As of March 31, 2016, the total advances made by NantCapital and NantOmics to us pursuant to each applicable note were approximately $112.7 million and $40.0 million, respectively. In May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. In May 2016, the NantCapital Note was amended and restated to provide that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2021, and not on demand. On December 15, 2016, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated May 9, 2016, between us and NantCapital, to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note and to subordinate the Promissory Note in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. We can request additional advances subject to NantCapital approval, and the NantCapital Note bears interest at a per annum rate of 5.0% compounded annually and computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the year. NantCapital has the option, but not the obligation, to require us to repay any such amount in cash, Series A-2 units of NantOmics (based on a per unit price of $1.484) held by us, shares of our common stock based on a per share price of $18.6126 (if such equity exists at the time of repayment), or any combination of the foregoing at the sole discretion of NantCapital.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity, our stockholders could experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marketing of our products and scale back our business and operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated:\n\n- 115 -\nTo date, our operations have been primarily financed through the proceeds from related party promissory notes and through equity issuances, including net cash proceeds from our IPO and net cash proceeds from our Convertible Notes private placement. In June 2016, we sold 6,900,000 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share, which includes 400,000 shares sold to the underwriter upon exercise of their overallotment option to purchase additional shares of our Company. We raised net proceeds of $83.6 million from our IPO, after underwriting fees, discounts and commissions of $4.9 million and other offering costs of $8.1 million. In December 2016 we issued Convertible Notes to related party and others for net proceeds of $102.7 million, $9.9 million from Cambridge and $92.8 million from others, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $4.3 million.\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities have been driven by rate of revenue, billings, and collections, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, and enhancements to existing services, and the timing of general and administrative expenses as we grow our administrative infrastructure, and the continuing market acceptance of our solution. In addition, our net loss in the year ended December 31, 2016 has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of substantial non-cash charges.\nCash used in operating activities of $70.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of our continued significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and increased expenses incurred as we became a public company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, and other expenses incurred to grow our business. In the year ended December 31, 2016, $102.6 million, or 56% of our net loss of $184.1 million consisted of non-cash items, including a $54.0 million in stock-based compensation, $30.9 million of depreciation and amortization, a $41.0 million equity in net loss of a related party investment, a $0.5 million provision for accounts receivable bad debts, a $0.5 million inventory provision, and other non-cash expenses of $0.1 million. The non-cash expenses were partially offset by non-cash income related to a deferred income tax benefit of $23.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $6.0 million increase in deferred implementation costs due to an increase in business activity associated with the growth of our business, $5.6 million in payments to vendors, and a $0.3 million increase in related party receivables, net. The cash used in operating activities was offset by a $8.1 million decrease in accounts receivable, net attributable to the receipt of payments from our clients, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.5 million, a $3.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased billings during the year ended December 31, 2016, a $3.8 million increase in accrued expenses, and an increase in $4.2 million in related party payables, net.\nCash used in operating activities of $74.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of spending on selling, administrative structure, and research and development efforts. In the year ended December 31, 2015, $20.4 million, or 28%, of our net loss of $72.0 million consisted of non-cash items, including $15.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation, and $0.3 million of changes in fair value of marketable securities. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 included a $21.2 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.7 million decrease in related party payables, net, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $4.2 million increase in deferred implementation costs, which were partially offset by an increase of $7.2 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $3.6 million decrease in accounts receivable, net and, a decrease of $1.0 million in inventory, and a decrease of $0.2 million in related party receivables, net.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in operating activities of $42.1 million consisted of a net loss of $84.6 million, primarily attributable to an increase in spending on selling, general and administrative expense and research and development efforts, and $1.0 million of cash used to fund changes in working capital, partially offset by $43.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in related party payables of $7.6 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $1.6 million offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of $4.6 million, a decrease in other liabilities of $2.9 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.9 million, an decrease in inventory of $2.3 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.5 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $24.2 million of intangible assets impairment as we realized a non-cash charge for the impairment of certain of our acquired intangible assets, $16.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.7 million of unrealized changes in fair value of our marketable securities, and $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions to expand our features and functionality of NantHealth solutions and capital expenditures to develop our software as well as to purchase computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure.\n- 116 -\nWe used $88.8 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily comprised of $78.7 million related to our acquisition of NaviNet, $15.8 million of purchases of equipment and investments in our capitalized software, partially offset by consideration received related to acquisitions of $4.4 million, proceeds from sale of marketable securities of $1.3 million and proceeds from sale of equipment of $0.1 million.\nWe used $95.3 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily comprised of investments in NantOmics of $150.8 million, acquisition of HCS of $48.1 million, investments in our capitalized software and purchase of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures of approximately $8.2 million, purchase of intangible asset of $5.0 million, and $1.8 million purchase of IOBS, partially offset by the proceeds of the sale of the marketable securities for $136.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $230.1 million, which primarily consisted of investments in marketable securities of $251.7 million as we invested our cash raised in mutual funds, purchase of intangible asset of $4.0 million, investment in unconsolidated related parties of $3.3 million, $7.6 million in capital expenditures and $2.3 million in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses. These were offset in part by $26.1 million in proceeds from sales of our marketable securities as we liquidated our investments as needed to provide for working capital and $12.8 million from the sale of businesses and equity method investments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $313.6 million was primarily due to $152.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of related party promissory notes, $83.6 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, as well as $9.9 million and $92.8 million, respectively of proceeds from the sale of convertible notes to a related party and others, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In addition, cash provided by financing activities was also due to $3.8 million in deemed capital contribution from our Chairman and CEO. These proceeds were partially offset by $23.3 million of reductions in notes payable related to the NaviNet acquisition, and $5.8 million payment to tax authorities on the employee's behalf to satisfy withholding requirements on income earned from vested shares.\nCash provided by financing activities of $171.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to $200.0 million in proceeds from an issuance of equity interests to Allscripts in addition to deemed capital contribution from our Chairman and CEO of $6.2 million. These proceeds were partially offset by $34.5 million payments of related party promissory notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities of $258.8 million consisted of $260.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of membership interests and $5.9 million in proceeds from related party promissory note offset in part by a $2.0 million in payments of notes payable.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt obligations, non-cancellable leases for our office space and certain equipment and vendor contracts to provide research services, and purchase obligations under license agreements and reseller agreements. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 in thousands:\n\n(1) Including capital lease obligation in an amount of $89 thousand for payment prior to one year subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nIn September 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Reseller Agreement, (\"Reseller Agreement\"), for genomic and proteomic sequencing services and related bioinformatics and analysis services with NantOmics, with an effective date of June\n- 117 -\n19, 2015. The Reseller Agreement has a contract period from June 2015 through December 31, 2020, subject to three potential three-year renewal options if we meet certain GPS Cancer thresholds. We agreed to pay NantOmics non-cancellable annual minimum fees of $2.0 million for each of the calendar years from 2016 through 2020, and subject to us exercising at least one of our renewal options, we are required to pay annual minimum fees to NantOmics of $25.0 million for each of the calendar years from 2021 through 2023 and $50.0 million per year for each of the calendar years from 2024 through 2029. We have the ability to terminate this agreement without cause. The Reseller Agreement permits us to use vendors other than NantOmics to provide any or all of the services that are currently being provided by NantOmics and clarifies that we are responsible for order fulfillment and branding.\nOn September 29, 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NorthShore University Health System, or NorthShore, to further develop their Health Heritage software platform, or Health Heritage, and to license the software to customers. As part of the agreement, we will pay NorthShore a one-time license fee of $5.0 million and minimum annual royalties of $750,000 for the first four years of the agreement. We will have no obligation to pay any additional royalties after seven years or once aggregate royalties reach $5.0 million.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn March 2017, a number of putative class action securities complaints were filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, naming as defendants the Company and certain of our executive officers and directors. The pending complaints are captioned Deora v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01825, Di Rienzo v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01912, and Shafik v. NantHealth, Inc., 2:17-cv-01940. Some of the complaints also name as defendants investment banks who were underwriters in our initial public offering. The complaints generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material misstatements and omissions concerning NantHealth's business, operations, and results. In particular, the complaints refer to an article in alleging that defendants misrepresented NantHealth's business with the University of Utah and donations to the university by non-profit entities associated with our founder Dr. Soon-Shiong. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief on behalf of putative classes of persons who purchased or acquired NantHealth securities in the IPO or on the open market from the time of the initial public offering through early March 2017. We believe that the claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. The monetary and other impact of this action may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise resolve this matter may be significant and divert management's attention. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in this lawsuit. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in this matter, we could be required to pay substantial amounts which might materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of accompanying Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee Note 21 of accompanying notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of related party transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n- 118 -\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock based compensation arrangements granted to employees in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation: Stock Compensation\u201d, by measuring the grant date fair value of the award and recognizing the resulting expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.\nWe account for stock based compensation arrangements issued to non-employees using the fair value approach prescribed by ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d. The value of non-employee stock based compensation is re-measured at the end of each reporting period until the award vests and is recognized as stock based compensation expense over the period during which the non-employee provides the services.\nStock based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate service period for awards that are only subject to service conditions and is recognized using the accelerated attribution method for awards that are subject to performance conditions. Stock based compensation expense is only recognized for awards subject to performance conditions if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.\nWe early adopted FASB ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d) related to stock based compensation, beginning July 1, 2016, simplifying the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. Per ASU 2016-09, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. We have elected to account for forfeitures when they occur. Cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity in the Statement of Cash Flows.\nSoftware Developed for Internal Use\nWe account for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with FASB ASC 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other \" (\"ASC 350\"). Computer software development costs are expensed as incurred, except for internal use software that qualify for capitalization as described below, and include employee related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses; costs of computer hardware and software; and costs incurred in developing features and functionality. These capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. We expense costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of software development and capitalizes costs incurred in the application development stage and costs associated with significant enhancements to existing internal use software applications. Software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years commencing when the software project is ready for its intended use.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services or products have been provided to the client, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. While most of the our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we on occasion provide payment terms to clients in excess of one year from the date of contract signing. We do not recognize revenue for arrangements containing these extended payment terms until such payments become due. Certain of our customer arrangements allow for termination for convenience with advanced notice. Such termination rights do not allow for refunds other than prepaid PCS or other services. These provisions do not affect the recognition of revenue. We also have certain arrangements which allow for termination and refunds of fees in the event that software acceptance by the customer has not occurred. In these instances, we will defer all revenue until software acceptance has occurred.\nThe sequencing and molecular analysis revenue is primarily generated from payments received from commercial third-party payors, hospitals and other provider networks and patients. We report revenue from arrangements with these customers on a gross basis in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations. We recognize revenue from these arrangements when all revenue recognition criteria have been met or on a cash basis when it cannot conclude that the fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We use judgment in our assessment of whether the fees are fixed or determinable and whether collectability is reasonably assured in determining when to recognize revenue in the future as it continues to gain payment experience with our customers. Accordingly, we expect to recognize revenue on a cash basis when we cannot conclude that the fees from a particular customer are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured until it has a sufficient history to reliably estimate payment patterns from such customer.\n- 119 -\nWe engage in various multiple-element arrangements, which may generate revenue across any of the sources noted above. For multiple-element software arrangements that involve the sale of our proprietary software, PCS, and other software-related services, VSOE of fair value is required to allocate and recognize revenue for each element. VSOE of fair value is determined based on the price charged in which each deliverable is sold separately. We have established VSOE for PCS on certain of our software solutions using the Stated Renewal Method. In this instance, we have determined that our stated renewals are substantive and appropriate for use in the Stated Renewal Method. We have not yet established VSOE of fair value for any element other than PCS for our arrangements. In situations where VSOE of fair value exists for PCS but not a delivered element (typically the software license and services elements), the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the undelivered element equal to its VSOE value with the remainder allocated to the delivered elements. In situations in which VSOE of fair value does not exist for all of the undelivered software-related elements, revenue is deferred until only one undelivered element remains (typically the PCS element) and then recognized following the pattern of delivery of the final undelivered element. Our multiple element arrangements typically provide for renewal of PCS terms upon expiration of the original term. The amounts of these PCS renewals are recognized as revenue ratably over the specified PCS renewal period.\nFor non-software arrangements that include multiple elements, primarily consisting of our SaaS agreements, revenue recognition involves the identification of separate units of accounting after consideration of combining and/or segmenting contracts and allocation of the arrangement consideration to the units of accounting on the basis of their relative selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on VSOE of fair value, if available, third party evidence, or TPE, of fair value if VSOE is not available, or our best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In determining the units of accounting for these arrangements, we evaluate whether each deliverable has standalone value as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance. Our SaaS arrangements are treated as a single unit of accounting as the professional services do not have standalone value. As a result, we recognize initial system implementation and deployment fees ratably over a period of time from when the system implementation or deployment services are completed and accepted by the customer over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated customer life. SaaS revenue consists of revenue earned from clients (typically on a monthly basis) for use of our subscription or license-based solutions and services. We recognize revenue from such contracts ratably over the contract period.\nIf an arrangement to deliver software requires significant production, modification or customization of the licensed software, we account for the arrangement as a construction-type contract. Currently we recognize revenue for these arrangements using the completed-contract method as it does not currently have sufficient information to reliably estimate the percentage of completion for these projects. We consider these arrangements to be substantially complete upon the clients' acceptance of the software and related professional services and consistently apply this policy to all contract accounting arrangements.\nTransaction processing fees are recognized on a monthly basis based on the number of transactions processed and the fee per transaction.\nRevenue derived from reseller arrangements is recognized when the resellers, in turn, sell the software solution to their clients and installation of the software solution has occurred, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. This is commonly referred to as the sell-through method and we defer recognition until there is a sell-through by the reseller to an actual end user clients and acceptance by the end user has occurred.\nProfits Interest Plan\nOn December 3, 2013, we adopted the Profits Interests Plan and reserved an aggregate of 63.8 million Series C units for issuance to our associates, consultants and contractors in consideration for bona fide services provided.\nThe Series C units were considered profits interests of us and did not entitle their holders (the \"Series C members\") to receive distributions if we were liquidated immediately after the grant. Instead, the Series C members were entitled to receive an allocation of a portion of our profits and losses arising after the date of the grant and, subject to vesting conditions, distributions made out of a portion of the our profits arising after the grant date of the Series C units. Grants of the Series C units were either fully vested, partially vested, or entirely unvested at the time of the grant as determined by the our Board of Directors.\nSeries C members were not entitled to receive any distributions until our aggregate distributions exceeded a hurdle amount applicable to those Series C units. The hurdle amount for each grant was determined by the Board of Directors at the date of issuance of such units. After all other members received their applicable hurdle amount, the Series C members were entitled to receive their percentage interest of such excess distributions.\n- 120 -\nPrior to the LLC Conversion on June 1, 2016, we had 3.5 million Series C units outstanding. Upon the LLC Conversion on June 1, 2016, we issued 28,973 shares of common stock to holders of vested Series C units and 10,462 shares of restricted stock to holders of unvested Series C units. The shares of restricted stock issued to holders of unvested profits interest are subject to forfeiture until becoming fully vested in accordance with the terms of the original Series C unit grant agreements.\nStock compensation expense for the Series C units/restricted stock issued to the nonemployees is calculated based on the fair value of the aware on each balance sheet date and the attribution of that cost is being recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nPhantom Unit Plan\nOn March 31, 2015, we approved the Phantom Unit Plan. The maximum number of phantom units that may be issued under the Phantom Unit Plan is equal to 11.6 million minus the number of issued and outstanding Series C units. As of December 31, 2016, we had 4.3 million phantom units outstanding under the Phantom Unit Plan. Each grant of phantom units made to a participant under the Phantom Unit Plan vests over a defined service period, subject to completion of a liquidity event, and is subject to forfeiture upon termination of the participant's continuous service to us for any reason. Our IPO satisfied the liquidity event condition, and the phantom units now entitle their holders to cash or non-cash payments in an amount equal to the number of vested units held by that participant multiplied by the fair market value of our common stock, as determined by our board of directors.\nWe intend to settle all vested phantom unit payments held by United States-based participants in shares of our common stock and classified these awards as equity awards in our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet. Awards held by participants who are based outside of the United States will be settled in cash and are classified within accrued expenses on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. In order to satisfy payroll withholding tax obligations triggered by the issuance of shares of common stock to holders of vested phantom units, we issue recipients a net lower number of shares of common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations, and remitted a cash payment for the related withholding taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 1.1 million shares of common stock, after withholding 0.5 million shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. We made a cash payment of $5.8 million to cover employee withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes upon the settlement of these vested phantom units. We also paid $0.2 million to cash-settle 17 thousand vested phantom units held by participants of the Phantom Unit Plan based outside of the United States.\nUtilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards\nWe had federal, state and foreign income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $238.9 million, $169.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, available to offset taxable income in tax year 2017 and thereafter. The federal NOL's will start to expire in year 2023.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that we have recently undergone one or more ownership changes. The above NOL amounts do not include the NOLs expected to expire before they can be utilized under Section 382.\nThe occurrence of such ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and possibly other tax attributes. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect. Any further ownership change also could cause such NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unused, thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows.\nIn addition, we may determine that varying state laws with respect to NOL utilization may result in lower limits, or an inability to utilize NOLs in some states altogether, which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes. In the event that state law results in lower limits, or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards, or we become subject to federal alternative minimum tax, this could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the\n- 121 -\npurchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We routinely monitor the factors impacting the acquired assets and liabilities. Transaction related costs are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or between annual tests when an impairment indicator exists. In the event there is a change in reporting units or segments, we will test for impairment at the reporting unit. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nAs part of the annual impairment test, we may conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets.\nIf an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. If a reporting unit's fair value is lower than its carrying value, we must determine the amount of implied goodwill that would be established if the reporting unit was hypothetically acquired on the impairment test date. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the amount of implied goodwill, we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess.\nThe determination of fair value of a reporting unit is based on a combination of a market approach that considers benchmark company market multiples and an income approach that uses discounted cash flows for each reporting unit utilizing Level 3 inputs. Under the income approach, we determine the fair value based on the present value of the most recent income projections for each reporting unit and calculates a terminal value utilizing a terminal growth rate. The significant assumptions under this approach include, among others: income projections, which are dependent on sales to new and existing clients, new solution introductions, client behavior, competitor pricing, operating expenses, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The cash flows used to determine fair value are dependent on a number of significant management assumptions based on historical experience, expectations of future performance, and the expected economic environment. Estimates are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future results. Additionally, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate are based on judgment of the rates that would be utilized by a hypothetical market participant.\nAccounting guidance requires that definite-lived intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets and ratably amortize the value over the estimated useful lives of those assets. If the estimates of the useful lives change, we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives or, if an asset is deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the value of the asset to its fair value may be required at such time.\nInvestment in Related Party\nInvestment in and advances to a related party in which we have a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20% to 50%, or for which we exercise significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. An investment in a limited liability company that is similar to partnership is also accounted for under the equity method if more than minor influence over the operation of the investee exists (generally through more than 3-5% ownership). As part of that accounting, we recognize gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by a related party that results in changes in the proportionate share of the dollar amount of the related party's equity.\n- 122 -\nThe investment in related party is assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net loss. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee's financial performance, and our ability and intention to retain the investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment's market value. The new cost basis of the investment is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nThe fair value of its equity method investment would be determined using the income approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. The related cash flow forecasts are discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital at the date of valuation.\nDifferences between the carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the related party are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on our analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, our share of the related party's reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the related party's historical book values.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nWe have classified the interest make-whole provision of our convertible notes due 2021 issued in December 2016 as a derivative liability that is recorded at fair value. This derivative liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. The change in the fair value of this derivative liability of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due primarily to the change in the value of our common stock from the date of issuance of our convertible notes to December 31, 2016.\nIncome taxes\nFASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ( Topic 740 \u201d) provides the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognizing, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including taking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided to us by our tax advisers, our legal advisers and similar tax cases. If at a later time our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or decrease.\n- 123 -\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company,\u201d we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act, including those relating to (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC with at least $700 million of outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years, or (iv) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering.", "item_7_tables": "Table 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
