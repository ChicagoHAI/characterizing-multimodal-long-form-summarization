Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto for the period ended June 30, 2019 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are qualified by the cautionary statement included in this review under the sub-heading, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Information,\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company's mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, better-for-you\u201d products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide.\nThe Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as better-for-you\u201d products, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Almond Dream\u00ae, Arrowhead Mills\u00ae, Bearitos\u00ae, Better Bean\u00ae, BluePrint\u00ae, Casbah\u00ae, Celestial Seasonings\u00ae, Clarks\u2122, Coconut Dream\u00ae, Cully & Sully\u00ae, Danival\u00ae, DeBoles\u00ae, Earth's Best\u00ae, Ella's Kitchen\u00ae, Europe's Best\u00ae, Farmhouse Fare\u2122, Frank Cooper's\u00ae, Gale's\u00ae, Garden of Eatin'\u00ae, GG UniqueFiber\u00ae, Hain Pure Foods\u00ae, Hartley's\u00ae, Health Valley\u00ae, Imagine\u00ae, Johnson's Juice Co.\u2122, Joya\u00ae, Lima\u00ae, Linda McCartney\u00ae (under license), MaraNatha\u00ae, Mary Berry (under license), Natumi\u00ae, New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae, Orchard House\u00ae, Rice Dream\u00ae, Robertson's\u00ae, Rudi's Gluten-Free Bakery\u2122, Rudi's Organic Bakery\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae, Spectrum\u00ae Organics, Soy Dream\u00ae, Sun-Pat\u00ae, Sunripe\u00ae, SunSpire\u00ae, Terra\u00ae, The Greek Gods\u00ae, Walnut Acres\u00ae, Yorkshire Provender\u00ae, Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae and William's\u2122. The Company's personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica\u00ae, Avalon Organics\u00ae, Earth's Best\u00ae, JASON\u00ae, Live Clean\u00ae and Queen Helene\u00ae brands.\nHistorically, the Company divided its business into core platforms, which are defined by common consumer need, route-to-market or internal advantage and are aligned with the Company's strategic roadmap to continue its leadership position in the organic and natural, better-for-you\u201d products industry. Those core platforms within our United States segment are:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Better-for-You Baby, which includes infant foods, infant and toddler formula, toddler and kids foods and diapers that nurture and care for babies and toddlers, under the Earth's Best\u00ae and Ella's Kitchen\u00ae brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Better-for-You Pantry, which includes core consumer staples, such as MaraNatha\u00ae, Arrowhead Mills\u00ae, Imagine\u00ae and Spectrum\u00ae brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Better-for-You Snacking, which includes wholesome products for in-between meals, such as Terra\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae and Garden of Eatin'\u00ae brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fresh Living, which includes yogurt, plant-based proteins and other refrigerated products, such as The Greek Gods\u00ae yogurt and Dream\u2122 plant-based beverage brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pure Personal Care, which includes personal care products focused on providing consumers with cleaner and gentler ingredients, such as JASON\u00ae, Live Clean\u00ae, Avalon Organics\u00ae and Alba Botanica\u00ae brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tea, which includes tea products marketed under the Celestial Seasonings\u00ae brand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company launched Hain Ventures (formerly known as Cultivate Ventures\u201d), a venture unit with a twofold purpose: (i) to strategically invest in the Company's smaller brands in high potential categories, by giving these brands a dedicated, creative focus for refresh and relaunch and (ii) to incubate and grow small acquisitions until they reach the scale required to migrate to the Company's core platforms.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company refined its strategy within the United States segment, focusing on simplifying the Company's portfolio and reinvigorating profitable sales growth through discontinuing uneconomic investment, realigning resources to coincide with individual brand role, reducing unproductive stock-keeping units ( SKUs\u201d) and brands, and reassessing current pricing architecture. As part of this initiative, the Company reviewed its product portfolio and divided it into Get Bigger\u201d and Get Better\u201d brand categories.\nThe Company's Get Bigger\u201d brands represent its strongest brands with higher margins, which compete in categories with strong growth. In order to capitalize on the potential of these brands, the Company began reallocating resources to optimize assortment and increase share of distribution. In addition, the Company will increase its marketing and innovation investments.\nThe Company's Get Better\u201d brands are the brands in which the Company is primarily focused on simplification and expansion of profit. Some of these are low margin, non-strategic brands that add complexity with minimal benefit to the Company's operations. Accordingly, in fiscal 2019, the Company initiated a SKU rationalization, which included the elimination of approximately 350 low velocity SKUs. The elimination of these SKUs is expected to impact sales growth in the next fiscal year, but is expected to result in expanded profits and a remaining set of core SKUs that will maintain their shelf space in the store.\nAs part of the Company's overall strategy, the Company may seek to dispose of businesses and brands that are less profitable or are otherwise less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio. Accordingly, the Company divested of all of its operations of the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment (discussed further below) and WestSoy\u00ae tofu, seitan and tempeh businesses in the United States. Additionally, on August 27, 2019, the Company sold the entities comprising its Tilda operating segment and certain other assets of the Tilda business. See Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProductivity and Transformation\nAs part of the Company's historical strategic review, it focused on a productivity initiative, which it called Project Terra.\u201d A key component of this project was the identification of global cost savings, and the removal of complexity from the business. This review has included and continues to include streamlining the Company's manufacturing plants, co-packers and supply chain, eliminating served categories or brands within those categories, and product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating slow moving SKUs.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company announced a new transformation initiative, of which one aspect is to identify additional areas of productivity savings to support sustainable profitable performance.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn March 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to sell all of the operations of the Hain Pure Protein Corporation ( HPPC\u201d) and EK Holdings, Inc. ( Empire Kosher\u201d or Empire\u201d) operating segments, which were reported in the aggregate as the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment. These dispositions were undertaken to reduce complexity in the Company's operations and simplify the Company's brand portfolio, in addition to allowing additional flexibility to focus on opportunities for growth and innovation in the Company's more profitable and faster growing core businesses.\nCollectively, these dispositions represented a strategic shift that had a major impact on the Company's operations and financial results and have been accounted for as discontinued operations.\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used primarily for the Plainville Farms business (a component of HPPC).\nOn June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. which includes the FreeBird and Empire Kosher businesses.\nSee Note 5, Discontinued Operations,in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan\nOn June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) succession plan, whereby the Company's former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. On October 26, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mark L. Schiller as President and CEO, succeeding Mr. Simon. In connection with the appointment, on October 26, 2018, the Company and Mr. Schiller entered into an employment agreement, which was approved by the Board, with Mr. Schiller's employment commencing on November 5, 2018. Accordingly, Mr. Simon's employment with the Company terminated on November 4, 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nResults of

</tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage is not meaningful\nNet Sales\nNet sales in fiscal 2019 were $2.30 billion, a decrease of $155.3 million, or 6.3%, from net sales of $2.46 billion in fiscal 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $52.6 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased approximately 4.2% from the prior year. Net sales decreased across all three of our reportable segments. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2019 was $445.2 million, a decrease of $70.2 million, or 13.6%, from gross profit of $515.4 million in fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin was 19.3%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by an inventory write-down of $12.4 million in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs primarily in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative, higher trade and promotional investments and increased freight and commodity costs primarily in the United States segment. These increased costs were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $340.9 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.2%, in fiscal 2019 from $341.6 million in fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower marketing investment costs in the United States, the reversal of previously accrued amounts under the net sales portion of the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 LTIPs and the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the relative TSR portion of the 2017-2019 LTIP due to specified performance metrics not being attained. See Note 14, Stock-based Compensation and Incentive Performance Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the aforementioned reversals under the Company's LTIPs. This decrease was offset in part by increased consulting costs in the United States, as well as increased variable compensation costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.8% in fiscal 2019 and 13.9% in the prior year, an increase of 90 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles was $15.3 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 16.0%, from $18.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to finite-lived intangibles from certain historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized subsequent to June 30, 2018.\nProject Terra Costs and Other\nProject Terra costs and other was $40.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $22.1 million from $18.0 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's Project Terra strategic review as well as increased severance costs in fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year period.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, net\nOn June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer succession plan, whereby the Company's former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. Net costs and expenses associated with the Company's Chief Executive Officer succession plan were $30.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $0.5 million in fiscal 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProceeds from Insurance Claims\nIn July of 2019, the Company received $7.0 million as partial payment from an insurance claim relating to business disruption costs associated with a co-packer. Of this amount $4.5 million was recognized in fiscal 2019 as it relates to reimbursement of costs already incurred. The Company will record an additional $2.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAccounting Review and Remediation Costs, net of Insurance Proceeds\nCosts and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $4.3 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2018. Included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were insurance proceeds of $0.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively, related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee and other related matters.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our Hain Ventures reporting unit within the Rest of World segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2019. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $17.9 million ($11.3 million related to the United States segment, $3.8 million related to the Rest of World segment and $2.8 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain tradenames of the Company. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company recorded $8.7 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to the Company's decision to consolidate manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in the United States and United Kingdom, some of which was used to manufacture certain slow moving SKUs that were discontinued.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at three of its manufacturing facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives due to the Company's decision to utilize third-party manufacturers for two facilities in the United States and to the closure of one facility to consolidate manufacturing of certain soup products in the United Kingdom. As such, the Company recorded a $6.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to the closures of these facilities. Additionally, the Company discontinued additional slow moving SKUs in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative. As a result, expected future cash flows are not expected to support the carrying value of certain machinery and equipment used to manufacture these products. As such, the Company recorded a $2.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of these assets to fair value. Also, during fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million related to the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain trade names of the Company.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nOperating loss in fiscal 2019 was $14.9 million compared to operating income of $106.0 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income resulted from the items described above.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, net\nInterest and other financing expense, net totaled $36.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $9.2 million, or 34.0%, from $26.9 million in the prior year. The increase in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from higher interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of higher variable interest rates. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther Expense/(Income), net\nOther expense/(income), net totaled $1.0 million of expense in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $3.1 million from $2.1 million of income in the prior year. Included in other expense/(income), net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were net unrealized foreign currency losses, which were higher than the prior year period principally due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated loans.\n(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss (Income) of Equity-Method Investees\nLoss before income taxes and equity in the net loss of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2019 was $52.0 million compared to income of $81.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to the items discussed above.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was $2.7 million and $0.9 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which significantly revised the ongoing U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time tax on foreign unremitted earnings and setting limitations on deductibility of certain costs (e.g., interest expense and executive compensation), among other things.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 required that the Company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company was allowed a\nmeasurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded an additional expense of $6.8 million related to its transition tax liability. The net increase in the transition tax was due to the finalization of the Company's earnings and profits study for the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The adjustment of the Company's provisional tax expense was recorded as a change in estimate in accordance with SAB No. 118. Despite the completion of the Company's accounting for Tax Act under SAB 118, many aspects of the law remain unclear, and the Company expects ongoing guidance to be issued at both the federal and state levels. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the impact of any new developments.\nThe Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A Topic No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the resulting tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The Company has computed the impact on our effective tax rate on a discrete basis.\nThe effective income tax benefit rate from continuing operations was 5.2% and 1.1% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, state taxes, provisions in the Tax Act including global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), finalization of the transition tax liability, and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by a net increase of $9.8 million in the Company's valuation allowance primarily related to the Company's state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of executive officers' compensation, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nOur effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.\nSee Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEquity in Net Loss (Income) of Equity-Method Investees\nOur equity in the net loss from our equity method investments for fiscal 2019 was $0.7 million compared to equity in net income of $0.3 million for fiscal 2018. See Note 15, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\nNet loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 was $49.9 million compared to net income of $82.4 million for fiscal 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $0.48 in fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.79 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was attributable to the factors noted above.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\nNet loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $133.4 million and $72.7 million, respectively, or $1.28 and $0.70 per diluted share, respectively. The increase in net loss from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to asset impairment charges of $109.3 million and losses on sale in connection with the disposition of the Plainville Farms and HPPC businesses of $40.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in each case recorded in fiscal 2019 and discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss for fiscal 2019 was $183.3 million compared to net income of $9.7 million for fiscal 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $1.76 in fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.09 in 2018. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $191.4 million and $255.9 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation of our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,302,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> $ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75,465\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % change\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(123,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> $ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(120,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % change\n</td> <td>(72.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019 operating income (loss) margin\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income margin\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited States\nOur net sales in the United States in fiscal 2019 were $1.01 billion, a decrease of $75.5 million, or 7.0%, from net sales of $1.08 billion in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by declines in our Pantry, Better-For-You-Baby, Fresh Living and Personal Care platforms. In addition, the declines were also driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins. Operating income in the United States in fiscal 2019 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $62.5 million, or 72.4%, from $86.3 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was the result of the aforementioned decrease in net sales, higher trade investments to drive future period growth, increased freight and logistics costs, start-up costs incurred in connection with a new manufacturing facility, inventory write-downs of $8.3 million in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs as part of a product rationalization initiative and a $6.5 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in fiscal 2019, offset in part by Project Terra cost savings.\nUnited Kingdom\nOur net sales in the United Kingdom in fiscal 2019 were $885.5 million, a decrease of $52.5 million, or 5.6%, from net sales of $938.0 million in fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 1.8% from the prior year. The net sales decrease on a constant currency basis was primarily due to declines from the New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae and Johnson's Juice Co.\u2122 brands and private label sales, offset in part by growth in the Company's Tilda and Ella's Kitchen businesses and growth in our Hartley's\u00ae brand. Operating income in the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2019 was $52.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6.5%, from $56.0 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales and a $8.7 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the consolidation of manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in fiscal 2019, partially offset by operating efficiencies achieved at Hain Daniels driven by Project Terra.\nRest of World\nOur net sales in Rest of World were $407.6 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $27.3 million, or 6.3%, from net sales of $434.9 million in fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.5% from the prior year. The decrease in net sales on a constant currency basis was primarily due to declines in Canada from the Company's Europe's Best\u00ae and Dream\u00ae brands and private label sales, partially offset by growth in our Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae and Live Clean\u00ae brands. Hain Ventures (formerly known as Cultivate Ventures) net sales decreased from the prior year, primarily driven by declines from the Blueprint\u00ae, SunSpire\u00ae and DeBoles\u00ae brands, offset in part by growth from the GG UniqueFiber\u2122 brand. Declines in Canada and Hain Ventures were offset by growth in Hain Europe primarily driven by increased sales from the Joya\u00ae and Natumi\u00ae brands and private label sales, partially offset by declines from the Danival\u00ae, Lima\u00ae and Dream\u00ae brands. Operating income in Rest of World for fiscal 2019 was $32.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million, or 15.1%, from $38.7 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales, charges related to SKU rationalizations across all operating segments in Rest of World, start-up costs incurred in connection with a new manufacturing facility in Canada and costs associated with the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in the United States due to the Company's decision to utilize a third-party manufacturer.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan expense, net, Project Terra costs and other and accounting review and remediation costs, net are included in Corporate and Other and were $30.2 million, $28.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Corporate and Other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 also includes trade name impairment charges of $17.9 million and a benefit of $4.5 million recorded in connection with proceeds received for an insurance claim. Corporate and Other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included Project Terra costs and other and accounting review and remediation costs of $10.1 million and $9.3 million (net of $5.7 million of insurance proceeds), respectively. Corporate and Other also included impairment charges of $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.\nRefer to Note 19, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial

Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $80.0 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased approximately 1.5% from the prior year period. The increase in net sales was due to sales growth in the United Kingdom, Europe and Canada businesses, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the United States segment. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2018 was $515.4 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 0.8%, from gross profit of $519.4 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted gross margin by $15.9 million as compared to the prior year. Gross profit margin was 21.0%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by decreased gross profit in the United States due to increased commodity and freight and logistics costs, increased trade investment and costs associated with the aforementioned SKU rationalization and higher commodity costs in the United Kingdom. These increased\ncosts were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings and higher profit achieved on higher net sales in the United Kingdom and the Rest of World segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $341.6 million, an increase of $29.1 million, or 9.3%, in fiscal 2018 from $312.6 million in fiscal 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased principally due to higher marketing investment primarily in the United States and personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 13.9% in fiscal 2018 and 13.3% in the prior year, an increase of 60 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles was $18.2 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $1.2 million, or 7.1%, from $17.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the intangibles acquired as a result of the Company's recent acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rates. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProject Terra Costs and Other\nWe incurred Project Terra costs and other of $18.0 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $7.6 million from $10.4 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased severance costs in the current year period as compared to the prior year period related to the closures of two of the Company's manufacturing facilities in the United States and one manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's Project Terra strategic review.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, net\nNet costs and expenses associated with the Company's Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan were $0.5 million in fiscal 2018. There were no such costs incurred in fiscal 2017. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting Review and Remediation Costs, Net of Insurance Proceeds\nCosts and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $15.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $29.6 million in fiscal 2017. Also, included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2018 were insurance proceeds of $5.7 million related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee of the Company and other related matters. The net amount of accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2018 was $9.3 million.\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our Hain Ventures reporting unit within the Rest of World segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2017. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at three of its manufacturing facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives due to the Company's decision to utilize third-party manufacturers for two facilities in the United States and to the closure of one facility to consolidate manufacturing of certain soup products in the United Kingdom. As such, the Company recorded a $6.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to the closures of these facilities. Additionally, the Company discontinued additional slow moving SKUs in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative. As a result, expected future cash flows are not expected to support the carrying value of certain machinery and equipment used to manufacture these products. As such, the Company recorded a $2.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of these assets to fair value. Also, during fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million related to the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain trade names of the Company.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $14.1 million ($7.6 million related to the United Kingdom segment and $6.5 million related to the United States segment) related to certain trade names of the Company. Additionally, during fiscal 2017, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $26.4 million primarily related to the decision to exit of certain portions of our own-label chilled desserts business in the United Kingdom. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 8, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in fiscal 2018 was $106.0 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 3.1%, from $109.4 million in fiscal 2017. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 4.3% in fiscal 2018 compared with 4.7% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales resulted from the items described above.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, net\nInterest and other financing expense, net totaled $26.9 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $5.8 million, or 27.5%, from $21.1 million in the prior year. The increase in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from higher interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of higher variable interest rates on outstanding debt. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther (Income)/Expense, net\nOther (income)/expense, net totaled $2.1 million of income in fiscal 2018, an increase of $2.5 million from $0.4 million of expense in the prior year. Included in other (income)/expense, net were net unrealized and realized foreign currency gains, which were higher in the current period than the prior year period principally due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany loans.\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Equity-Method Investees\nIncome before income taxes and equity in the net income of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $81.2 million and $87.9 million, respectively. The decrease was due to the items discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was $0.9 million for the fiscal 2018 compared to $22.5 million of tax expense in fiscal 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was (1.1)% and 25.6% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of executive officers' compensation, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28.1% for fiscal 2018 and a 21% U.S. federal statutory rate for subsequent fiscal years.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's SAB 118 requires that the Company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, the Company recorded the following reasonable estimates of the tax impact in its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company accrued a $25.0 million provisional tax benefit related to the net change in deferred tax liabilities stemming from the Tax Act's reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, and disallowance of certain incentive based compensation tax deductibility under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company accrued a reasonable estimate of $7.1 million of tax expense for the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on the foreign subsidiaries' accumulated, unremitted earnings going back to 1986.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has recorded the final impact on the Company from the Tax Act's transition tax legislation in fiscal 2019. See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPursuant to SAB 118, the Company was allowed a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. The Company calculated the impact of the Tax Act and recorded any resulting tax adjustments during fiscal 2019.\nThe Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The Company will be subject to the GILTI provisions effective beginning July 1, 2018 and is in the process of analyzing its effects, including how to account for the GILTI provision from an accounting policy standpoint.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was also favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and a $4.0 million benefit relating to the release of the remainder of the Company's domestic uncertain tax position as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 was favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom enacted in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a $1.8 million decrease to the carrying balance of net deferred tax liabilities. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 was also favorably impacted by a $4.6 million benefit relating to the release of a portion of the Company's domestic uncertain tax position as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nOur effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.\nSee Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEquity in Net Income of Equity-Method Investees\nOur equity in the net income from our equity method investments for fiscal 2018 was $0.3 million compared to a $0.1 million for fiscal 2017. See Note 15, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations\nNet income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $82.4 million and $65.5 million, respectively, or $0.79 and $0.63 per diluted share, respectively. The increase was attributable to the factors noted above.\nNet (loss) Income from Discontinued Operations\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was net loss of $72.7 million and net income of $1.9 million, respectively, or $(0.70) and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively. The net loss for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to impairments of assets held for sale of $78.5 million in fiscal 2018 as discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, results for HPPC (which comprises the Plainville and FreeBird brands) were below our projections. The fourth quarter results, as well as negative market conditions in the sector, required the Company to reduce the internal projections for the business, which resulted in the Company lowering the projected long-term growth rate and profitability levels for HPPC. Accordingly, the updated projections indicated that the fair value of the HPPC business is below carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded asset impairments of $78.5 million, reflected in Net (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax in order to reduce the carrying amount of the net assets to their fair value less costs to sell. This impairment was partially offset by an increase in income tax benefit from discontinued operations from $0.6 million in fiscal 2017 to $5.7 million, which includes a $20.2 million deferred tax benefit arising from asset impairment charges and a $12.3 million deferred tax liability related to Hain Pure Protein being classified as held for sale in fiscal 2018.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $9.7 million and $67.4 million, or $0.09 and $0.65 per diluted share, respectively. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $255.9 million and $265.0 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2017 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,107,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,343,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% change\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2017 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(119,842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% change\n</td> <td>(40.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income margin\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2017 operating income margin\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited States\nOur net sales in the United States in fiscal 2018 were $1.08 billion, a decrease of $22.9 million, or 2.1%, from net sales of $1.11 billion in fiscal 2017. The decrease in net sales was driven by declines in our Better-for-You Snacking, Fresh Living and Better-for-You-Pantry platforms, partially offset by growth in our Pure Personal Care, Better-for-You Baby and Tea platforms. In addition, the declines were also driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins as the Company continues its focus on its top 500 SKUs and 11 brands in the United States as well as increased trade investment. Net sales in the prior year period were negatively impacted by a realignment of customer inventories at certain distributor customers. Operating income in the United States in fiscal 2018 was $86.3 million, a decrease of $59.0 million, or 40.6%, from operating income of $145.3 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income was the result of lower sales, higher trade and marketing investments to drive current and future period growth, increased freight and logistics, commodity and other input costs and costs associated with the closure of two of our manufacturing facilities in the United States. These increased costs were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings in the current period. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted in both periods by charges related to the initiation of SKU rationalizations.\nUnited Kingdom\nOur net sales in the United Kingdom in fiscal 2018 were $938.0 million, an increase of $86.3 million, or 10.1%, from net sales of $851.8 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $54.4 million as compared to the prior year. The net sales increase on a constant currency basis was primarily due to growth from our Tilda\u00ae, Ella's Kitchen\u00ae, Hartley's\u00ae, Cully & Sully\u00ae and Linda McCartney's\u00ae brands, partially offset by lower New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was the impact of price realization, as well as the acquisitions of The Yorkshire Provender Limited and Clarks. Operating income in the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2018 was $56.0 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 7.9%, from $51.9 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned\nincrease in sales, operating efficiencies achieved at Hain Daniels, Project Terra cost savings and the impact of favorable foreign currency. These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs, marketing investments and costs associated with the planned closure of a soup manufacturing facility.\nRest of World\nOur net sales in Rest of World were $434.9 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $50.9 million, or 13.3%, from net sales of $383.9 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $25.5 million as compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales on a constant currency basis was primarily due to increased sales volume in Europe related to both branded and private label non-dairy products, as well as increased sales in Canada driven by growth in our Tilda\u00ae, Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae,Sensible Portions\u00ae and Live Clean\u00ae brands, partially offset by Europe's Best\u00ae lost distribution. Operating income in Rest of World for fiscal 2018 was $38.7 million, an increase of $6.7 million, or 20.8%, from $32.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in sales as well as operating efficiencies achieved at our plant-based manufacturing facilities in Europe, Project Terra cost savings and the impact of favorable foreign currency.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, Project Terra costs and other included in Corporate and Other totaled $10.1 million and $10.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Corporate and Other category also included accounting review costs of $9.3 million (net of $5.7 million of insurance proceeds) and $29.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and impairment charges of $13.3 million and $40.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRefer to Note 19, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings available to us under our Credit Agreement and Amended Credit Agreement (defined below).\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $67.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $39.5 million compared to $106.6 million at June 30, 2018. Our working capital was $318.6 million at June 30, 2019, a decrease of $310.5 million from $629.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018, which included current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations of $191.0 million.\nLiquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the Company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are held in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe and India. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 77.9% ($30.8 million) of the Company's total cash balance was held outside of the United States. It is our current intent to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the United States. However, we intend to further study changes enacted by the Tax Act, costs of repatriation and the current and future cash needs of foreign operations to determine whether there is an opportunity to repatriate foreign cash balances in the future on a tax-efficient basis.\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent. As of June 30, 2019, all of our investments were expected to mature in less than three months. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 resulted primarily from a decrease of $126.9 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges, offset by $55.1 million of cash provided by within working capital accounts, primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $121.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to $232.7 million provided in fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from an additional $97.5 million of cash used within working capital accounts, primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease of $13.9 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges.\nCash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $70.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $77.1 million. We used cash in investing activities of $82.5 million during fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which was principally made up of $12.4 million, net of cash acquired, in connection with our Clarks UK Limited acquisition and $70.9 million for capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We used cash in investing activities of $60.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which was principally for the acquisitions of Better Bean and Yorkshire Provender and capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $44.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We had net debt repayments of $77.0 million funded primarily through proceeds received from the sale of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. Additionally, we paid $3.5 million during fiscal 2019 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $36.0 million of proceeds received from operations of discontinued operations. Net cash of $69.5 million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We had net debt repayments of $40.7 million funded primarily through cash flows from operations. Additionally, we paid $7.2 million during fiscal 2018 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $21.6 million to fund the operations of discontinued operations. Net cash of $147.1 million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. We had net repayments of $110.4 million funded primarily through cash flows from operations. Additionally, we paid $8.3 million during fiscal 2017 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $25.9 million to fund the operations of discontinued operations.\nOperating Free Cash Flow\nOur operating free cash flow was negative $27.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $78.0 million from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in operating free cash flow primarily resulted from an increase in our capital expenditures of $6.2 million and a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $126.9 million, offset in part by cash provided within working capital accounts of $55.1 million. We expect that our capital spending for fiscal 2020 will be approximately $70-$80 million, and we may incur additional costs in connection with Project Terra. We refer the reader to the Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to operating free cash flow from continuing operations.\nCredit Agreement\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility through February 6, 2023 and provides for a $300.0 million term loan. Under the Credit Agreement, the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional uncommitted $400.0 million, provided certain conditions are met. Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate (both of which are defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin, which is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings may be used to provide working capital, finance capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions, refinance certain existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nOn May 8, 2019, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), whereby, among other things, its allowable consolidated leverage ratio increased to no more than 5.0 to 1.0 from March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2019, no more than 4.75 to 1.0 at March 31, 2020, no more than 4.25 to 1.0 at June 30, 2020 and no more than 4.0 to 1.0 on September 30, 2020 and thereafter. The allowable consolidated leverage ratio for each period was decreased by 0.25 upon sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, the Company's required consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) was reduced to no less than 3.0 to 1 through March 31, 2020, no less than 3.75 to 1 through March 31, 2021 and no less than 4.0 to 1 thereafter. The Amended Credit Agreement also required that the Company and the subsidiary guarantors enter into a Security and Pledge Agreement pursuant to which all of the obligations under Amended Credit Agreement are secured by liens on assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries, including stock of each of their direct subsidiaries and intellectual property, subject to agreed upon exceptions. Additionally, the Company is now required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of no less than 3.0 to 1 through March 31, 2020, no less than 3.75 to 1 through March 31, 2021 and no less than 4.0 to 1 thereafter. The allowable consolidated leverage ratio was decreased by 0.25 upon sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides that loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a rate ranging from 0.875% to 2.50% per annum; or (b) the Base Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a rate ranging from 0.00% to 1.50% per annum, the relevant rate being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. Swing line loans and Global Swing Line loans denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate, and Global Swing Line loans denominated in foreign currencies shall bear interest based on the overnight Eurocurrency Rate for loans denominated in such currency plus the Applicable Rate. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019 was 4.20%. Additionally, the Amended Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, on the amount unused under the Amended Credit Agreement ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid. As part of the Amended Credit Agreement, HPPC was released from its obligations as a borrower and a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business and utilized proceeds from the sale, net of transaction related costs, to prepay a portion of the term loan. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on the sale of the Hain Pure Protein business.\nAs of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $626.8 million and $698.1 million of borrowings outstanding, respectively, under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nTilda Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements\nOur former Tilda business maintained short-term borrowing arrangements primarily used to fund the purchase of rice from India and other countries. The maximum borrowings permitted under all such arrangements were \u00a352.0 million. Outstanding borrowings were collateralized by the current assets of Tilda, typically had six-month terms and bore interest at variable rates typically based on LIBOR plus a margin (weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.38% at June 30, 2019). As of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $8.7 million and $9.3 million of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements, respectively. On August 27, 2019, we sold our Tilda business as discussed in Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 21, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans,\nin private transactions or otherwise. The authorization does not have a stated expiration date. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this program in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017, and accordingly, as of the end of fiscal 2019, we had $250 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase program.\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures\nWe have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.\nFor each of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and Board of Directors believes the non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and Board of Directors uses the non-U.S. GAAP measure. These non-U.S. GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nConstant Currency Presentation\nWe believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.\nA reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales decrease in fiscal 2019 is as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hain Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,302,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of foreign currency exchange\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales on a constant currency basis - Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>921,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,355,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales decrease on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales increase in fiscal 2018 is as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hain Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of foreign currency exchange\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales on a constant currency basis - Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,343,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales increase on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, equity in the earnings of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, Project Terra costs and other, and other non-recurring items. The Company's management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the\nCompany and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with U.S. GAAP results.\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: Table

internal evaluations, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure operating free cash flow from continuing operations.\u201d The difference between operating free cash flow from continuing operations and cash flow provided by or used in operating activities from continuing operations, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that operating free cash flow from continuing operations reflects the impact of capital expenditures. Since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash provided by or used in operating activities. We view operating free cash flow from continuing operations as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments. We do not consider operating free cash flow from continuing operations in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nA reconciliation from cash flow provided by operating activities to Operating free cash flow is as follows: Table 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(77,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating free cash flow continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,609\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nObligations for all debt instruments, capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5+ years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>118,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>275,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,136,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Including principal and interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Excludes amounts that may be payable upon termination to co-packers as we are not able to reasonably estimate such amounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of June 30, 2019, we had non-current unrecognized tax benefits of $11.9 million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows. As a result, this amount has not been included in the table above.\nWe believe that our cash on hand of $39.5 million at June 30, 2019 as well as projected cash flows from operations and availability under our Amended Credit Agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business, anticipated fiscal 2020 capital expenditures and other expected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates; however, materially different amounts\nmight be reported under different conditions or using assumptions, estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied. Our critical accounting policies, including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural foods stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. The majority of our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. Our customer contracts typically contain standard terms and conditions. In instances where formal written contracts are not in place we consider the customer purchase orders to be contracts based on the criteria outlined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Payment terms and conditions vary by customer and are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers, but we generally provide credit terms to customers ranging from 15-60 days; therefore, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.\nSales to customers generally do not include more than one performance obligation. When a contract does contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for each distinct good is generally determined by directly observable data.\nWe have determined that we satisfy our performance obligations related to our customer contracts at a point in time, as opposed to over time, and, accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time. Therefore, we do not have any contract balances with our customers recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSales includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of discounts, trade promotions and sales incentives, consumer coupon programs and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a fulfillment activity of our promise to transfer products to our customers and are included in cost of sales line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nVariable Consideration\nIn addition to fixed contract consideration, many of our contracts include some form of variable consideration. We offer various trade promotions and sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, slotting fees, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The expenses associated with these programs are accounted for as reductions to the transaction price of our products and are therefore deducted from our net sales to determine reported net sales. Trade promotions and sales incentive accruals are subject to significant management estimates and assumptions. The critical assumptions used in estimating the accruals for trade promotions and sales incentives include management's estimate of expected levels of performance and redemption rates. Management exercises judgment in developing these assumptions. These assumptions are based upon historical performance of the retailer or distributor customers with similar types of promotions adjusted for current trends. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions and incentives based on what has been incurred by the customers. The terms of most of our promotion and incentive arrangements do not exceed a year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorization process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. Differences between estimated expense and actual promotion and incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract\nAs our contracts are generally shorter than one year, the Company has elected a practical expedient under ASU 2014-09 that allows the Company to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the contract period is for one year or less. These costs are included in the selling, general and administrative expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDisaggregation of Net Sales\nThe Company does not disaggregate revenue below the segment revenues level disclosed in Note 17, Segment Information, as all revenues are recognized at a point in time and the Company's segment revenues depict how the economic factors affect the nature, amount, and timing and uncertainty of cash flows.\nValuation of Accounts and Chargeback Receivable\nWe perform routine credit evaluations on existing and new customers. We apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply an additional reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories. Credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years. While Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, Sam's Club and ASDA, together represented approximately 12% of accounts receivable, net at June 30, 2019, we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time.\nBased on cash collection history and other statistical analysis, we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken that we expect will be collectible and repaid in the near future and records a chargeback receivable. Differences between estimated collectible receivables and actual collections are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.\nWe may not have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions, or with changes in business conditions, such as consolidation within the food industry and/or a change in the way we market and sell our products.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nOur growth strategy has historically included the acquisition of numerous brands and businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to judgment as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nThe accounting for the acquisitions we have made requires that the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as any contingent consideration that may be part of the agreement, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. This requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values, especially with respect to intangible assets, including estimates of expected cash flows, expected cost savings and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. As a result of these significant judgments to be made, we occasionally obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate, it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change. See Note 6, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nFixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. We generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows. The assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability, our estimated working capital needs, as well as our weighted average cost of capital. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses. Estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The\namount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied\u201d fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. We measure the fair value of these assets using the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that the trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received. We estimate the future revenues for the associated brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, in conjunction with its budgeting and forecasting process for fiscal year 2020, and concluded that no indicators of impairment existed at any of its reporting units.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill was $1.01 billion. As of the 2019 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 20%, with the exception of the Tilda and Grocery and Snacks reporting units, whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by 13% and 8%, respectively. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, other than the Tilda reporting unit, to be in excess of the fair value. However, the fair values of the Hain Daniels, Grocery and Snacks and Hain Ventures reporting units would exceed their respective carrying values by less than 10%. The fair values were based on significant management assumptions including an estimate of future cash flow. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. The Company will continue to monitor impairment indicators and financial results in future periods.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million in its Hain Ventures reporting unit primarily as a result of lowered projected long-term revenue growth rates and profitability levels.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated on an annual basis in conjunction with the Company's evaluation of goodwill, or on an interim basis if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its indefinite-life intangible assets below their carrying value. In assessing fair value, the Company utilizes a relief from royalty payments\u201d methodology. This approach involves two steps: (i) estimating the royalty rates for each trademark and (ii) applying these royalty rates to a projected net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed in certain of the Company's indefinite-lived tradenames. The result of this interim assessment indicated that the fair value of certain of the Company's tradenames was below their carrying value, and therefore an impairment charge of $17.9 million was recognized ($11.3 million in the United States segment, $3.8 million in the Rest of World segment and $2.8 million in the United Kingdom segment) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The result of the annual assessment for the year ended June 30, 2019 indicated that the fair value of the Company's trade names exceeded their carrying values and no indicators of impairment were present. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, a trade name impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million in the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million in the United Kingdom segment) was recorded. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, a trade name impairment charge of $14.1 million ($7.6 million in the United Kingdom segment and $6.5 million in the United States segment) was recorded.\nSee also Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee and non-employee directors services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition, which cliff vest, are recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. Stock-based compensation awards with service conditions only are also recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight-line method.\nFor awards that contain a market condition, expense is recognized over the defined or derived service period using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized for these awards on a straight-line basis over the service period, regardless of the eventual number of shares that are earned based upon the market condition, provided that each grantee remains an employee\nat the end of the performance period. Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the service period a grantee is no longer an employee.\nValuation Allowances for Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods. Deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years. Accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is more likely than not\u201d that the deductions, losses or credits will be used in the future. A valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met. Our determination of our valuation allowances is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses, primarily in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in Belgium, against which we have recorded valuation allowances. The losses in the United Kingdom were recorded prior to the acquisition of Daniels. Under current tax law in these jurisdictions, our carryforward losses have no expiration. During fiscal 2019, the Company released the valuation allowance on a majority of its U.K. net operating loss carryforwards as it is more likely than not that the losses are realizable.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we recorded a partial valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards as it is not more likely than not that the state tax attributes will be realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nSeasonality\nCertain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, baking products, hot cereal, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our prepared food and personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto for the period ended June 30, 2019 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are qualified by the cautionary statement included in this review under the sub-heading, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Information,\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company's mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, better-for-you\u201d products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide.\nThe Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as better-for-you\u201d products, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Almond Dream\u00ae, Arrowhead Mills\u00ae, Bearitos\u00ae, Better Bean\u00ae, BluePrint\u00ae, Casbah\u00ae, Celestial Seasonings\u00ae, Clarks\u2122, Coconut Dream\u00ae, Cully & Sully\u00ae, Danival\u00ae, DeBoles\u00ae, Earth's Best\u00ae, Ella's Kitchen\u00ae, Europe's Best\u00ae, Farmhouse Fare\u2122, Frank Cooper's\u00ae, Gale's\u00ae, Garden of Eatin'\u00ae, GG UniqueFiber\u00ae, Hain Pure Foods\u00ae, Hartley's\u00ae, Health Valley\u00ae, Imagine\u00ae, Johnson's Juice Co.\u2122, Joya\u00ae, Lima\u00ae, Linda McCartney\u00ae (under license), MaraNatha\u00ae, Mary Berry (under license), Natumi\u00ae, New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae, Orchard House\u00ae, Rice Dream\u00ae, Robertson's\u00ae, Rudi's Gluten-Free Bakery\u2122, Rudi's Organic Bakery\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae, Spectrum\u00ae Organics, Soy Dream\u00ae, Sun-Pat\u00ae, Sunripe\u00ae, SunSpire\u00ae, Terra\u00ae, The Greek Gods\u00ae, Walnut Acres\u00ae, Yorkshire Provender\u00ae, Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae and William's\u2122. The Company's personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica\u00ae, Avalon Organics\u00ae, Earth's Best\u00ae, JASON\u00ae, Live Clean\u00ae and Queen Helene\u00ae brands.\nHistorically, the Company divided its business into core platforms, which are defined by common consumer need, route-to-market or internal advantage and are aligned with the Company's strategic roadmap to continue its leadership position in the organic and natural, better-for-you\u201d products industry. Those core platforms within our United States segment are:\n \u2022 Better-for-You Baby, which includes infant foods, infant and toddler formula, toddler and kids foods and diapers that nurture and care for babies and toddlers, under the Earth's Best\u00ae and Ella's Kitchen\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Better-for-You Pantry, which includes core consumer staples, such as MaraNatha\u00ae, Arrowhead Mills\u00ae, Imagine\u00ae and Spectrum\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Better-for-You Snacking, which includes wholesome products for in-between meals, such as Terra\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae and Garden of Eatin'\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Fresh Living, which includes yogurt, plant-based proteins and other refrigerated products, such as The Greek Gods\u00ae yogurt and Dream\u2122 plant-based beverage brands. \n \u2022 Pure Personal Care, which includes personal care products focused on providing consumers with cleaner and gentler ingredients, such as JASON\u00ae, Live Clean\u00ae, Avalon Organics\u00ae and Alba Botanica\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Tea, which includes tea products marketed under the Celestial Seasonings\u00ae brand. \nAdditionally, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company launched Hain Ventures (formerly known as Cultivate Ventures\u201d), a venture unit with a twofold purpose: (i) to strategically invest in the Company's smaller brands in high potential categories, by giving these brands a dedicated, creative focus for refresh and relaunch and (ii) to incubate and grow small acquisitions until they reach the scale required to migrate to the Company's core platforms.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company refined its strategy within the United States segment, focusing on simplifying the Company's portfolio and reinvigorating profitable sales growth through discontinuing uneconomic investment, realigning resources to coincide with individual brand role, reducing unproductive stock-keeping units ( SKUs\u201d) and brands, and reassessing current pricing architecture. As part of this initiative, the Company reviewed its product portfolio and divided it into Get Bigger\u201d and Get Better\u201d brand categories.\nThe Company's Get Bigger\u201d brands represent its strongest brands with higher margins, which compete in categories with strong growth. In order to capitalize on the potential of these brands, the Company began reallocating resources to optimize assortment and increase share of distribution. In addition, the Company will increase its marketing and innovation investments.\nThe Company's Get Better\u201d brands are the brands in which the Company is primarily focused on simplification and expansion of profit. Some of these are low margin, non-strategic brands that add complexity with minimal benefit to the Company's operations. Accordingly, in fiscal 2019, the Company initiated a SKU rationalization, which included the elimination of approximately 350 low velocity SKUs. The elimination of these SKUs is expected to impact sales growth in the next fiscal year, but is expected to result in expanded profits and a remaining set of core SKUs that will maintain their shelf space in the store.\nAs part of the Company's overall strategy, the Company may seek to dispose of businesses and brands that are less profitable or are otherwise less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio. Accordingly, the Company divested of all of its operations of the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment (discussed further below) and WestSoy\u00ae tofu, seitan and tempeh businesses in the United States. Additionally, on August 27, 2019, the Company sold the entities comprising its Tilda operating segment and certain other assets of the Tilda business. See Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProductivity and Transformation\nAs part of the Company's historical strategic review, it focused on a productivity initiative, which it called Project Terra.\u201d A key component of this project was the identification of global cost savings, and the removal of complexity from the business. This review has included and continues to include streamlining the Company's manufacturing plants, co-packers and supply chain, eliminating served categories or brands within those categories, and product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating slow moving SKUs.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company announced a new transformation initiative, of which one aspect is to identify additional areas of productivity savings to support sustainable profitable performance.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn March 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to sell all of the operations of the Hain Pure Protein Corporation ( HPPC\u201d) and EK Holdings, Inc. ( Empire Kosher\u201d or Empire\u201d) operating segments, which were reported in the aggregate as the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment. These dispositions were undertaken to reduce complexity in the Company's operations and simplify the Company's brand portfolio, in addition to allowing additional flexibility to focus on opportunities for growth and innovation in the Company's more profitable and faster growing core businesses.\nCollectively, these dispositions represented a strategic shift that had a major impact on the Company's operations and financial results and have been accounted for as discontinued operations.\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used primarily for the Plainville Farms business (a component of HPPC).\nOn June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. which includes the FreeBird and Empire Kosher businesses.\nSee Note 5, Discontinued Operations,in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan\nOn June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) succession plan, whereby the Company's former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. On October 26, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mark L. Schiller as President and CEO, succeeding Mr. Simon. In connection with the appointment, on October 26, 2018, the Company and Mr. Schiller entered into an employment agreement, which was approved by the Board, with Mr. Schiller's employment commencing on November 5, 2018. Accordingly, Mr. Simon's employment with the Company terminated on November 4, 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2019 to Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2018\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table compares our results of operations, including as a percentage of

Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $52.6 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased approximately 4.2% from the prior year. Net sales decreased across all three of our reportable segments. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2019 was $445.2 million, a decrease of $70.2 million, or 13.6%, from gross profit of $515.4 million in fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin was 19.3%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by an inventory write-down of $12.4 million in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs primarily in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative, higher trade and promotional investments and increased freight and commodity costs primarily in the United States segment. These increased costs were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $340.9 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.2%, in fiscal 2019 from $341.6 million in fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower marketing investment costs in the United States, the reversal of previously accrued amounts under the net sales portion of the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 LTIPs and the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the relative TSR portion of the 2017-2019 LTIP due to specified performance metrics not being attained. See Note 14, Stock-based Compensation and Incentive Performance Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the aforementioned reversals under the Company's LTIPs. This decrease was offset in part by increased consulting costs in the United States, as well as increased variable compensation costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.8% in fiscal 2019 and 13.9% in the prior year, an increase of 90 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles was $15.3 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 16.0%, from $18.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to finite-lived intangibles from certain historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized subsequent to June 30, 2018.\nProject Terra Costs and Other\nProject Terra costs and other was $40.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $22.1 million from $18.0 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's Project Terra strategic review as well as increased severance costs in fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year period.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, net\nOn June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer succession plan, whereby the Company's former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. Net costs and expenses associated with the Company's Chief Executive Officer succession plan were $30.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $0.5 million in fiscal 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProceeds from Insurance Claims\nIn July of 2019, the Company received $7.0 million as partial payment from an insurance claim relating to business disruption costs associated with a co-packer. Of this amount $4.5 million was recognized in fiscal 2019 as it relates to reimbursement of costs already incurred. The Company will record an additional $2.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAccounting Review and Remediation Costs, net of Insurance Proceeds\nCosts and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $4.3 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2018. Included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were insurance proceeds of $0.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively, related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee and other related matters.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our Hain Ventures reporting unit within the Rest of World segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2019. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $17.9 million ($11.3 million related to the United States segment, $3.8 million related to the Rest of World segment and $2.8 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain tradenames of the Company. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company recorded $8.7 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to the Company's decision to consolidate manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in the United States and United Kingdom, some of which was used to manufacture certain slow moving SKUs that were discontinued.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at three of its manufacturing facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives due to the Company's decision to utilize third-party manufacturers for two facilities in the United States and to the closure of one facility to consolidate manufacturing of certain soup products in the United Kingdom. As such, the Company recorded a $6.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to the closures of these facilities. Additionally, the Company discontinued additional slow moving SKUs in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative. As a result, expected future cash flows are not expected to support the carrying value of certain machinery and equipment used to manufacture these products. As such, the Company recorded a $2.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of these assets to fair value. Also, during fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million related to the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain trade names of the Company.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nOperating loss in fiscal 2019 was $14.9 million compared to operating income of $106.0 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income resulted from the items described above.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, net\nInterest and other financing expense, net totaled $36.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $9.2 million, or 34.0%, from $26.9 million in the prior year. The increase in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from higher interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of higher variable interest rates. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther Expense/(Income), net\nOther expense/(income), net totaled $1.0 million of expense in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $3.1 million from $2.1 million of income in the prior year. Included in other expense/(income), net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were net unrealized foreign currency losses, which were higher than the prior year period principally due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated loans.\n(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss (Income) of Equity-Method Investees\nLoss before income taxes and equity in the net loss of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2019 was $52.0 million compared to income of $81.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to the items discussed above.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was $2.7 million and $0.9 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which significantly revised the ongoing U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time tax on foreign unremitted earnings and setting limitations on deductibility of certain costs (e.g., interest expense and executive compensation), among other things.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 required that the Company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company was allowed a\nmeasurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded an additional expense of $6.8 million related to its transition tax liability. The net increase in the transition tax was due to the finalization of the Company's earnings and profits study for the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The adjustment of the Company's provisional tax expense was recorded as a change in estimate in accordance with SAB No. 118. Despite the completion of the Company's accounting for Tax Act under SAB 118, many aspects of the law remain unclear, and the Company expects ongoing guidance to be issued at both the federal and state levels. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the impact of any new developments.\nThe Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A Topic No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the resulting tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The Company has computed the impact on our effective tax rate on a discrete basis.\nThe effective income tax benefit rate from continuing operations was 5.2% and 1.1% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, state taxes, provisions in the Tax Act including global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), finalization of the transition tax liability, and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by a net increase of $9.8 million in the Company's valuation allowance primarily related to the Company's state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of executive officers' compensation, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nOur effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.\nSee Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEquity in Net Loss (Income) of Equity-Method Investees\nOur equity in the net loss from our equity method investments for fiscal 2019 was $0.7 million compared to equity in net income of $0.3 million for fiscal 2018. See Note 15, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\nNet loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 was $49.9 million compared to net income of $82.4 million for fiscal 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $0.48 in fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.79 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was attributable to the factors noted above.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\nNet loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $133.4 million and $72.7 million, respectively, or $1.28 and $0.70 per diluted share, respectively. The increase in net loss from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to asset impairment charges of $109.3 million and losses on sale in connection with the disposition of the Plainville Farms and HPPC businesses of $40.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in each case recorded in fiscal 2019 and discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss for fiscal 2019 was $183.3 million compared to net income of $9.7 million for fiscal 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $1.76 in fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.09 in 2018. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $191.4 million and $255.9 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation of our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,302,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> $ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75,465\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(155,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % change\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(123,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> $ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(120,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % change\n</td> <td>(72.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019 operating income (loss) margin\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income margin\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited States\nOur net sales in the United States in fiscal 2019 were $1.01 billion, a decrease of $75.5 million, or 7.0%, from net sales of $1.08 billion in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by declines in our Pantry, Better-For-You-Baby, Fresh Living and Personal Care platforms. In addition, the declines were also driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins. Operating income in the United States in fiscal 2019 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $62.5 million, or 72.4%, from $86.3 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was the result of the aforementioned decrease in net sales, higher trade investments to drive future period growth, increased freight and logistics costs, start-up costs incurred in connection with a new manufacturing facility, inventory write-downs of $8.3 million in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs as part of a product rationalization initiative and a $6.5 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in fiscal 2019, offset in part by Project Terra cost savings.\nUnited Kingdom\nOur net sales in the United Kingdom in fiscal 2019 were $885.5 million, a decrease of $52.5 million, or 5.6%, from net sales of $938.0 million in fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 1.8% from the prior year. The net sales decrease on a constant currency basis was primarily due to declines from the New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae and Johnson's Juice Co.\u2122 brands and private label sales, offset in part by growth in the Company's Tilda and Ella's Kitchen businesses and growth in our Hartley's\u00ae brand. Operating income in the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2019 was $52.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6.5%, from $56.0 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales and a $8.7 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the consolidation of manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in fiscal 2019, partially offset by operating efficiencies achieved at Hain Daniels driven by Project Terra.\nRest of World\nOur net sales in Rest of World were $407.6 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $27.3 million, or 6.3%, from net sales of $434.9 million in fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.5% from the prior year. The decrease in net sales on a constant currency basis was primarily due to declines in Canada from the Company's Europe's Best\u00ae and Dream\u00ae brands and private label sales, partially offset by growth in our Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae and Live Clean\u00ae brands. Hain Ventures (formerly known as Cultivate Ventures) net sales decreased from the prior year, primarily driven by declines from the Blueprint\u00ae, SunSpire\u00ae and DeBoles\u00ae brands, offset in part by growth from the GG UniqueFiber\u2122 brand. Declines in Canada and Hain Ventures were offset by growth in Hain Europe primarily driven by increased sales from the Joya\u00ae and Natumi\u00ae brands and private label sales, partially offset by declines from the Danival\u00ae, Lima\u00ae and Dream\u00ae brands. Operating income in Rest of World for fiscal 2019 was $32.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million, or 15.1%, from $38.7 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales, charges related to SKU rationalizations across all operating segments in Rest of World, start-up costs incurred in connection with a new manufacturing facility in Canada and costs associated with the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in the United States due to the Company's decision to utilize a third-party manufacturer.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan expense, net, Project Terra costs and other and accounting review and remediation costs, net are included in Corporate and Other and were $30.2 million, $28.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Corporate and Other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 also includes trade name impairment charges of $17.9 million and a benefit of $4.5 million recorded in connection with proceeds received for an insurance claim. Corporate and Other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included Project Terra costs and other and accounting review and remediation costs of $10.1 million and $9.3 million (net of $5.7 million of insurance proceeds), respectively. Corporate and Other also included impairment charges of $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.\nRefer to Note 19, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nComparison of Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2018 to Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table

</tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage is not meaningful\nNet Sales\nNet sales in fiscal 2018 were $2.46 billion, an increase of $114.3 million, or 4.9%, from net sales of $2.34 billion in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $80.0 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased approximately 1.5% from the prior year period. The increase in net sales was due to sales growth in the United Kingdom, Europe and Canada businesses, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the United States segment. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2018 was $515.4 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 0.8%, from gross profit of $519.4 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted gross margin by $15.9 million as compared to the prior year. Gross profit margin was 21.0%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by decreased gross profit in the United States due to increased commodity and freight and logistics costs, increased trade investment and costs associated with the aforementioned SKU rationalization and higher commodity costs in the United Kingdom. These increased\ncosts were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings and higher profit achieved on higher net sales in the United Kingdom and the Rest of World segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $341.6 million, an increase of $29.1 million, or 9.3%, in fiscal 2018 from $312.6 million in fiscal 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased principally due to higher marketing investment primarily in the United States and personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 13.9% in fiscal 2018 and 13.3% in the prior year, an increase of 60 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles was $18.2 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $1.2 million, or 7.1%, from $17.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the intangibles acquired as a result of the Company's recent acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rates. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProject Terra Costs and Other\nWe incurred Project Terra costs and other of $18.0 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $7.6 million from $10.4 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased severance costs in the current year period as compared to the prior year period related to the closures of two of the Company's manufacturing facilities in the United States and one manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's Project Terra strategic review.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, net\nNet costs and expenses associated with the Company's Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan were $0.5 million in fiscal 2018. There were no such costs incurred in fiscal 2017. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting Review and Remediation Costs, Net of Insurance Proceeds\nCosts and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $15.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $29.6 million in fiscal 2017. Also, included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2018 were insurance proceeds of $5.7 million related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee of the Company and other related matters. The net amount of accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2018 was $9.3 million.\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our Hain Ventures reporting unit within the Rest of World segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2017. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at three of its manufacturing facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives due to the Company's decision to utilize third-party manufacturers for two facilities in the United States and to the closure of one facility to consolidate manufacturing of certain soup products in the United Kingdom. As such, the Company recorded a $6.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to the closures of these facilities. Additionally, the Company discontinued additional slow moving SKUs in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative. As a result, expected future cash flows are not expected to support the carrying value of certain machinery and equipment used to manufacture these products. As such, the Company recorded a $2.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of these assets to fair value. Also, during fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million related to the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain trade names of the Company.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $14.1 million ($7.6 million related to the United Kingdom segment and $6.5 million related to the United States segment) related to certain trade names of the Company. Additionally, during fiscal 2017, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $26.4 million primarily related to the decision to exit of certain portions of our own-label chilled desserts business in the United Kingdom. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 8, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in fiscal 2018 was $106.0 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 3.1%, from $109.4 million in fiscal 2017. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 4.3% in fiscal 2018 compared with 4.7% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales resulted from the items described above.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, net\nInterest and other financing expense, net totaled $26.9 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $5.8 million, or 27.5%, from $21.1 million in the prior year. The increase in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from higher interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of higher variable interest rates on outstanding debt. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther (Income)/Expense, net\nOther (income)/expense, net totaled $2.1 million of income in fiscal 2018, an increase of $2.5 million from $0.4 million of expense in the prior year. Included in other (income)/expense, net were net unrealized and realized foreign currency gains, which were higher in the current period than the prior year period principally due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany loans.\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Equity-Method Investees\nIncome before income taxes and equity in the net income of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $81.2 million and $87.9 million, respectively. The decrease was due to the items discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was $0.9 million for the fiscal 2018 compared to $22.5 million of tax expense in fiscal 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was (1.1)% and 25.6% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of executive officers' compensation, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28.1% for fiscal 2018 and a 21% U.S. federal statutory rate for subsequent fiscal years.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's SAB 118 requires that the Company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, the Company recorded the following reasonable estimates of the tax impact in its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.\n \u2022 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company accrued a $25.0 million provisional tax benefit related to the net change in deferred tax liabilities stemming from the Tax Act's reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, and disallowance of certain incentive based compensation tax deductibility under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). \n \u2022 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company accrued a reasonable estimate of $7.1 million of tax expense for the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on the foreign subsidiaries' accumulated, unremitted earnings going back to 1986. \nThe Company has recorded the final impact on the Company from the Tax Act's transition tax legislation in fiscal 2019. See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPursuant to SAB 118, the Company was allowed a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. The Company calculated the impact of the Tax Act and recorded any resulting tax adjustments during fiscal 2019.\nThe Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The Company will be subject to the GILTI provisions effective beginning July 1, 2018 and is in the process of analyzing its effects, including how to account for the GILTI provision from an accounting policy standpoint.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was also favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and a $4.0 million benefit relating to the release of the remainder of the Company's domestic uncertain tax position as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 was favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom enacted in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a $1.8 million decrease to the carrying balance of net deferred tax liabilities. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 was also favorably impacted by a $4.6 million benefit relating to the release of a portion of the Company's domestic uncertain tax position as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nOur effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.\nSee Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEquity in Net Income of Equity-Method Investees\nOur equity in the net income from our equity method investments for fiscal 2018 was $0.3 million compared to a $0.1 million for fiscal 2017. See Note 15, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations\nNet income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $82.4 million and $65.5 million, respectively, or $0.79 and $0.63 per diluted share, respectively. The increase was attributable to the factors noted above.\nNet (loss) Income from Discontinued Operations\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was net loss of $72.7 million and net income of $1.9 million, respectively, or $(0.70) and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively. The net loss for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to impairments of assets held for sale of $78.5 million in fiscal 2018 as discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, results for HPPC (which comprises the Plainville and FreeBird brands) were below our projections. The fourth quarter results, as well as negative market conditions in the sector, required the Company to reduce the internal projections for the business, which resulted in the Company lowering the projected long-term growth rate and profitability levels for HPPC. Accordingly, the updated projections indicated that the fair value of the HPPC business is below carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded asset impairments of $78.5 million, reflected in Net (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax in order to reduce the carrying amount of the net assets to their fair value less costs to sell. This impairment was partially offset by an increase in income tax benefit from discontinued operations from $0.6 million in fiscal 2017 to $5.7 million, which includes a $20.2 million deferred tax benefit arising from asset impairment charges and a $12.3 million deferred tax liability related to Hain Pure Protein being classified as held for sale in fiscal 2018.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $9.7 million and $67.4 million, or $0.09 and $0.65 per diluted share, respectively. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $255.9 million and $265.0 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2017 net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,107,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,343,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% change\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2017 operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(119,842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% change\n</td> <td>(40.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018 operating income margin\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2017 operating income margin\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited States\nOur net sales in the United States in fiscal 2018 were $1.08 billion, a decrease of $22.9 million, or 2.1%, from net sales of $1.11 billion in fiscal 2017. The decrease in net sales was driven by declines in our Better-for-You Snacking, Fresh Living and Better-for-You-Pantry platforms, partially offset by growth in our Pure Personal Care, Better-for-You Baby and Tea platforms. In addition, the declines were also driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins as the Company continues its focus on its top 500 SKUs and 11 brands in the United States as well as increased trade investment. Net sales in the prior year period were negatively impacted by a realignment of customer inventories at certain distributor customers. Operating income in the United States in fiscal 2018 was $86.3 million, a decrease of $59.0 million, or 40.6%, from operating income of $145.3 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income was the result of lower sales, higher trade and marketing investments to drive current and future period growth, increased freight and logistics, commodity and other input costs and costs associated with the closure of two of our manufacturing facilities in the United States. These increased costs were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings in the current period. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted in both periods by charges related to the initiation of SKU rationalizations.\nUnited Kingdom\nOur net sales in the United Kingdom in fiscal 2018 were $938.0 million, an increase of $86.3 million, or 10.1%, from net sales of $851.8 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $54.4 million as compared to the prior year. The net sales increase on a constant currency basis was primarily due to growth from our Tilda\u00ae, Ella's Kitchen\u00ae, Hartley's\u00ae, Cully & Sully\u00ae and Linda McCartney's\u00ae brands, partially offset by lower New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was the impact of price realization, as well as the acquisitions of The Yorkshire Provender Limited and Clarks. Operating income in the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2018 was $56.0 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 7.9%, from $51.9 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned\nincrease in sales, operating efficiencies achieved at Hain Daniels, Project Terra cost savings and the impact of favorable foreign currency. These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs, marketing investments and costs associated with the planned closure of a soup manufacturing facility.\nRest of World\nOur net sales in Rest of World were $434.9 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $50.9 million, or 13.3%, from net sales of $383.9 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $25.5 million as compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales on a constant currency basis was primarily due to increased sales volume in Europe related to both branded and private label non-dairy products, as well as increased sales in Canada driven by growth in our Tilda\u00ae, Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae,Sensible Portions\u00ae and Live Clean\u00ae brands, partially offset by Europe's Best\u00ae lost distribution. Operating income in Rest of World for fiscal 2018 was $38.7 million, an increase of $6.7 million, or 20.8%, from $32.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in sales as well as operating efficiencies achieved at our plant-based manufacturing facilities in Europe, Project Terra cost savings and the impact of favorable foreign currency.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, Project Terra costs and other included in Corporate and Other totaled $10.1 million and $10.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Corporate and Other category also included accounting review costs of $9.3 million (net of $5.7 million of insurance proceeds) and $29.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and impairment charges of $13.3 million and $40.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRefer to Note 19, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings available to us under our Credit Agreement and Amended Credit Agreement (defined below).\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $67.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $39.5 million compared to $106.6 million at June 30, 2018. Our working capital was $318.6 million at June 30, 2019, a decrease of $310.5 million from $629.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018, which included current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations of $191.0 million.\nLiquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the Company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are held in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe and India. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 77.9% ($30.8 million) of the Company's total cash balance was held outside of the United States. It is our current intent to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the United States. However, we intend to further study changes enacted by the Tax Act, costs of repatriation and the current and future cash needs of foreign operations to determine whether there is an opportunity to repatriate foreign cash balances in the future on a tax-efficient basis.\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent. As of June 30, 2019, all of our investments were expected to mature in less than three months. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 resulted primarily from a decrease of $126.9 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges, offset by $55.1 million of cash provided by within working capital accounts, primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $121.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to $232.7 million provided in fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from an additional $97.5 million of cash used within working capital accounts, primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease of $13.9 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges.\nCash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $70.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $77.1 million. We used cash in investing activities of $82.5 million during fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which was principally made up of $12.4 million, net of cash acquired, in connection with our Clarks UK Limited acquisition and $70.9 million for capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We used cash in investing activities of $60.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which was principally for the acquisitions of Better Bean and Yorkshire Provender and capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $44.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We had net debt repayments of $77.0 million funded primarily through proceeds received from the sale of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. Additionally, we paid $3.5 million during fiscal 2019 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $36.0 million of proceeds received from operations of discontinued operations. Net cash of $69.5 million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We had net debt repayments of $40.7 million funded primarily through cash flows from operations. Additionally, we paid $7.2 million during fiscal 2018 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $21.6 million to fund the operations of discontinued operations. Net cash of $147.1 million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. We had net repayments of $110.4 million funded primarily through cash flows from operations. Additionally, we paid $8.3 million during fiscal 2017 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $25.9 million to fund the operations of discontinued operations.\nOperating Free Cash Flow\nOur operating free cash flow was negative $27.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $78.0 million from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in operating free cash flow primarily resulted from an increase in our capital expenditures of $6.2 million and a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $126.9 million, offset in part by cash provided within working capital accounts of $55.1 million. We expect that our capital spending for fiscal 2020 will be approximately $70-$80 million, and we may incur additional costs in connection with Project Terra. We refer the reader to the Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to operating free cash flow from continuing operations.\nCredit Agreement\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility through February 6, 2023 and provides for a $300.0 million term loan. Under the Credit Agreement, the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional uncommitted $400.0 million, provided certain conditions are met. Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate (both of which are defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin, which is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings may be used to provide working capital, finance capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions, refinance certain existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nOn May 8, 2019, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), whereby, among other things, its allowable consolidated leverage ratio increased to no more than 5.0 to 1.0 from March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2019, no more than 4.75 to 1.0 at March 31, 2020, no more than 4.25 to 1.0 at June 30, 2020 and no more than 4.0 to 1.0 on September 30, 2020 and thereafter. The allowable consolidated leverage ratio for each period was decreased by 0.25 upon sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, the Company's required consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) was reduced to no less than 3.0 to 1 through March 31, 2020, no less than 3.75 to 1 through March 31, 2021 and no less than 4.0 to 1 thereafter. The Amended Credit Agreement also required that the Company and the subsidiary guarantors enter into a Security and Pledge Agreement pursuant to which all of the obligations under Amended Credit Agreement are secured by liens on assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries, including stock of each of their direct subsidiaries and intellectual property, subject to agreed upon exceptions. Additionally, the Company is now required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of no less than 3.0 to 1 through March 31, 2020, no less than 3.75 to 1 through March 31, 2021 and no less than 4.0 to 1 thereafter. The allowable consolidated leverage ratio was decreased by 0.25 upon sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides that loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a rate ranging from 0.875% to 2.50% per annum; or (b) the Base Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a rate ranging from 0.00% to 1.50% per annum, the relevant rate being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. Swing line loans and Global Swing Line loans denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate, and Global Swing Line loans denominated in foreign currencies shall bear interest based on the overnight Eurocurrency Rate for loans denominated in such currency plus the Applicable Rate. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019 was 4.20%. Additionally, the Amended Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, on the amount unused under the Amended Credit Agreement ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid. As part of the Amended Credit Agreement, HPPC was released from its obligations as a borrower and a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business and utilized proceeds from the sale, net of transaction related costs, to prepay a portion of the term loan. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on the sale of the Hain Pure Protein business.\nAs of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $626.8 million and $698.1 million of borrowings outstanding, respectively, under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nTilda Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements\nOur former Tilda business maintained short-term borrowing arrangements primarily used to fund the purchase of rice from India and other countries. The maximum borrowings permitted under all such arrangements were \u00a352.0 million. Outstanding borrowings were collateralized by the current assets of Tilda, typically had six-month terms and bore interest at variable rates typically based on LIBOR plus a margin (weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.38% at June 30, 2019). As of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $8.7 million and $9.3 million of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements, respectively. On August 27, 2019, we sold our Tilda business as discussed in Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 21, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans,\nin private transactions or otherwise. The authorization does not have a stated expiration date. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this program in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017, and accordingly, as of the end of fiscal 2019, we had $250 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase program.\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures\nWe have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.\nFor each of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and Board of Directors believes the non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and Board of Directors uses the non-U.S. GAAP measure. These non-U.S. GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nConstant Currency Presentation\nWe believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.\nA reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales decrease in fiscal 2019 is as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hain Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,302,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of foreign currency exchange\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales on a constant currency basis - Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>921,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,355,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales decrease on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales increase in fiscal 2018 is as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hain Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>938,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,457,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of foreign currency exchange\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales on a constant currency basis - Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales - Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,343,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales increase on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, equity in the earnings of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, Project Terra costs and other, and other non-recurring items. The Company's management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the\nCompany and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with U.S. GAAP results.\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: Table

internal evaluations, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure operating free cash flow from continuing operations.\u201d The difference between operating free cash flow from continuing operations and cash flow provided by or used in operating activities from continuing operations, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that operating free cash flow from continuing operations reflects the impact of capital expenditures. Since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash provided by or used in operating activities. We view operating free cash flow from continuing operations as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments. We do not consider operating free cash flow from continuing operations in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nA reconciliation from cash flow provided by operating activities to Operating free cash flow is as follows: Table 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(77,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating free cash flow continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,609\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nObligations for all debt instruments, capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5+ years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>118,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>275,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,136,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Including principal and interest. \n (2) Excludes amounts that may be payable upon termination to co-packers as we are not able to reasonably estimate such amounts.  As of June 30, 2019, we had non-current unrecognized tax benefits of $11.9 million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows. As a result, this amount has not been included in the table above.\nWe believe that our cash on hand of $39.5 million at June 30, 2019 as well as projected cash flows from operations and availability under our Amended Credit Agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business, anticipated fiscal 2020 capital expenditures and other expected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates; however, materially different amounts\nmight be reported under different conditions or using assumptions, estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied. Our critical accounting policies, including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural foods stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. The majority of our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. Our customer contracts typically contain standard terms and conditions. In instances where formal written contracts are not in place we consider the customer purchase orders to be contracts based on the criteria outlined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Payment terms and conditions vary by customer and are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers, but we generally provide credit terms to customers ranging from 15-60 days; therefore, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.\nSales to customers generally do not include more than one performance obligation. When a contract does contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for each distinct good is generally determined by directly observable data.\nWe have determined that we satisfy our performance obligations related to our customer contracts at a point in time, as opposed to over time, and, accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time. Therefore, we do not have any contract balances with our customers recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSales includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of discounts, trade promotions and sales incentives, consumer coupon programs and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a fulfillment activity of our promise to transfer products to our customers and are included in cost of sales line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nVariable Consideration\nIn addition to fixed contract consideration, many of our contracts include some form of variable consideration. We offer various trade promotions and sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, slotting fees, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The expenses associated with these programs are accounted for as reductions to the transaction price of our products and are therefore deducted from our net sales to determine reported net sales. Trade promotions and sales incentive accruals are subject to significant management estimates and assumptions. The critical assumptions used in estimating the accruals for trade promotions and sales incentives include management's estimate of expected levels of performance and redemption rates. Management exercises judgment in developing these assumptions. These assumptions are based upon historical performance of the retailer or distributor customers with similar types of promotions adjusted for current trends. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions and incentives based on what has been incurred by the customers. The terms of most of our promotion and incentive arrangements do not exceed a year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorization process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. Differences between estimated expense and actual promotion and incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract\nAs our contracts are generally shorter than one year, the Company has elected a practical expedient under ASU 2014-09 that allows the Company to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the contract period is for one year or less. These costs are included in the selling, general and administrative expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDisaggregation of Net Sales\nThe Company does not disaggregate revenue below the segment revenues level disclosed in Note 17, Segment Information, as all revenues are recognized at a point in time and the Company's segment revenues depict how the economic factors affect the nature, amount, and timing and uncertainty of cash flows.\nValuation of Accounts and Chargeback Receivable\nWe perform routine credit evaluations on existing and new customers. We apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply an additional reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories. Credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years. While Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, Sam's Club and ASDA, together represented approximately 12% of accounts receivable, net at June 30, 2019, we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time.\nBased on cash collection history and other statistical analysis, we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken that we expect will be collectible and repaid in the near future and records a chargeback receivable. Differences between estimated collectible receivables and actual collections are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.\nWe may not have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions, or with changes in business conditions, such as consolidation within the food industry and/or a change in the way we market and sell our products.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nOur growth strategy has historically included the acquisition of numerous brands and businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to judgment as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nThe accounting for the acquisitions we have made requires that the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as any contingent consideration that may be part of the agreement, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. This requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values, especially with respect to intangible assets, including estimates of expected cash flows, expected cost savings and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. As a result of these significant judgments to be made, we occasionally obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate, it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change. See Note 6, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nFixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. We generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows. The assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability, our estimated working capital needs, as well as our weighted average cost of capital. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses. Estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The\namount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied\u201d fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. We measure the fair value of these assets using the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that the trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received. We estimate the future revenues for the associated brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, in conjunction with its budgeting and forecasting process for fiscal year 2020, and concluded that no indicators of impairment existed at any of its reporting units.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill was $1.01 billion. As of the 2019 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 20%, with the exception of the Tilda and Grocery and Snacks reporting units, whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by 13% and 8%, respectively. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, other than the Tilda reporting unit, to be in excess of the fair value. However, the fair values of the Hain Daniels, Grocery and Snacks and Hain Ventures reporting units would exceed their respective carrying values by less than 10%. The fair values were based on significant management assumptions including an estimate of future cash flow. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. The Company will continue to monitor impairment indicators and financial results in future periods.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million in its Hain Ventures reporting unit primarily as a result of lowered projected long-term revenue growth rates and profitability levels.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated on an annual basis in conjunction with the Company's evaluation of goodwill, or on an interim basis if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its indefinite-life intangible assets below their carrying value. In assessing fair value, the Company utilizes a relief from royalty payments\u201d methodology. This approach involves two steps: (i) estimating the royalty rates for each trademark and (ii) applying these royalty rates to a projected net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed in certain of the Company's indefinite-lived tradenames. The result of this interim assessment indicated that the fair value of certain of the Company's tradenames was below their carrying value, and therefore an impairment charge of $17.9 million was recognized ($11.3 million in the United States segment, $3.8 million in the Rest of World segment and $2.8 million in the United Kingdom segment) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The result of the annual assessment for the year ended June 30, 2019 indicated that the fair value of the Company's trade names exceeded their carrying values and no indicators of impairment were present. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, a trade name impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million in the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million in the United Kingdom segment) was recorded. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, a trade name impairment charge of $14.1 million ($7.6 million in the United Kingdom segment and $6.5 million in the United States segment) was recorded.\nSee also Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee and non-employee directors services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition, which cliff vest, are recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. Stock-based compensation awards with service conditions only are also recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight-line method.\nFor awards that contain a market condition, expense is recognized over the defined or derived service period using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized for these awards on a straight-line basis over the service period, regardless of the eventual number of shares that are earned based upon the market condition, provided that each grantee remains an employee\nat the end of the performance period. Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the service period a grantee is no longer an employee.\nValuation Allowances for Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods. Deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years. Accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is more likely than not\u201d that the deductions, losses or credits will be used in the future. A valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met. Our determination of our valuation allowances is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses, primarily in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in Belgium, against which we have recorded valuation allowances. The losses in the United Kingdom were recorded prior to the acquisition of Daniels. Under current tax law in these jurisdictions, our carryforward losses have no expiration. During fiscal 2019, the Company released the valuation allowance on a majority of its U.K. net operating loss carryforwards as it is more likely than not that the losses are realizable.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we recorded a partial valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards as it is not more likely than not that the state tax attributes will be realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nSeasonality\nCertain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, baking products, hot cereal, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our prepared food and personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto for the period ended June 30, 2019 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are qualified by the cautionary statement included in this review under the sub-heading, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Information,\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company's mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, better-for-you\u201d products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide.\nThe Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as better-for-you\u201d products, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Almond Dream\u00ae, Arrowhead Mills\u00ae, Bearitos\u00ae, Better Bean\u00ae, BluePrint\u00ae, Casbah\u00ae, Celestial Seasonings\u00ae, Clarks\u2122, Coconut Dream\u00ae, Cully & Sully\u00ae, Danival\u00ae, DeBoles\u00ae, Earth's Best\u00ae, Ella's Kitchen\u00ae, Europe's Best\u00ae, Farmhouse Fare\u2122, Frank Cooper's\u00ae, Gale's\u00ae, Garden of Eatin'\u00ae, GG UniqueFiber\u00ae, Hain Pure Foods\u00ae, Hartley's\u00ae, Health Valley\u00ae, Imagine\u00ae, Johnson's Juice Co.\u2122, Joya\u00ae, Lima\u00ae, Linda McCartney\u00ae (under license), MaraNatha\u00ae, Mary Berry (under license), Natumi\u00ae, New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae, Orchard House\u00ae, Rice Dream\u00ae, Robertson's\u00ae, Rudi's Gluten-Free Bakery\u2122, Rudi's Organic Bakery\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae, Spectrum\u00ae Organics, Soy Dream\u00ae, Sun-Pat\u00ae, Sunripe\u00ae, SunSpire\u00ae, Terra\u00ae, The Greek Gods\u00ae, Walnut Acres\u00ae, Yorkshire Provender\u00ae, Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae and William's\u2122. The Company's personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica\u00ae, Avalon Organics\u00ae, Earth's Best\u00ae, JASON\u00ae, Live Clean\u00ae and Queen Helene\u00ae brands.\nHistorically, the Company divided its business into core platforms, which are defined by common consumer need, route-to-market or internal advantage and are aligned with the Company's strategic roadmap to continue its leadership position in the organic and natural, better-for-you\u201d products industry. Those core platforms within our United States segment are:\n \u2022 Better-for-You Baby, which includes infant foods, infant and toddler formula, toddler and kids foods and diapers that nurture and care for babies and toddlers, under the Earth's Best\u00ae and Ella's Kitchen\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Better-for-You Pantry, which includes core consumer staples, such as MaraNatha\u00ae, Arrowhead Mills\u00ae, Imagine\u00ae and Spectrum\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Better-for-You Snacking, which includes wholesome products for in-between meals, such as Terra\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae and Garden of Eatin'\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Fresh Living, which includes yogurt, plant-based proteins and other refrigerated products, such as The Greek Gods\u00ae yogurt and Dream\u2122 plant-based beverage brands. \n \u2022 Pure Personal Care, which includes personal care products focused on providing consumers with cleaner and gentler ingredients, such as JASON\u00ae, Live Clean\u00ae, Avalon Organics\u00ae and Alba Botanica\u00ae brands. \n \u2022 Tea, which includes tea products marketed under the Celestial Seasonings\u00ae brand. \nAdditionally, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company launched Hain Ventures (formerly known as Cultivate Ventures\u201d), a venture unit with a twofold purpose: (i) to strategically invest in the Company's smaller brands in high potential categories, by giving these brands a dedicated, creative focus for refresh and relaunch and (ii) to incubate and grow small acquisitions until they reach the scale required to migrate to the Company's core platforms.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company refined its strategy within the United States segment, focusing on simplifying the Company's portfolio and reinvigorating profitable sales growth through discontinuing uneconomic investment, realigning resources to coincide with individual brand role, reducing unproductive stock-keeping units ( SKUs\u201d) and brands, and reassessing current pricing architecture. As part of this initiative, the Company reviewed its product portfolio and divided it into Get Bigger\u201d and Get Better\u201d brand categories.\nThe Company's Get Bigger\u201d brands represent its strongest brands with higher margins, which compete in categories with strong growth. In order to capitalize on the potential of these brands, the Company began reallocating resources to optimize assortment and increase share of distribution. In addition, the Company will increase its marketing and innovation investments.\nThe Company's Get Better\u201d brands are the brands in which the Company is primarily focused on simplification and expansion of profit. Some of these are low margin, non-strategic brands that add complexity with minimal benefit to the Company's operations. Accordingly, in fiscal 2019, the Company initiated a SKU rationalization, which included the elimination of approximately 350 low velocity SKUs. The elimination of these SKUs is expected to impact sales growth in the next fiscal year, but is expected to result in expanded profits and a remaining set of core SKUs that will maintain their shelf space in the store.\nAs part of the Company's overall strategy, the Company may seek to dispose of businesses and brands that are less profitable or are otherwise less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio. Accordingly, the Company divested of all of its operations of the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment (discussed further below) and WestSoy\u00ae tofu, seitan and tempeh businesses in the United States. Additionally, on August 27, 2019, the Company sold the entities comprising its Tilda operating segment and certain other assets of the Tilda business. See Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nProductivity and Transformation\nAs part of the Company's historical strategic review, it focused on a productivity initiative, which it called Project Terra.\u201d A key component of this project was the identification of global cost savings, and the removal of complexity from the business. This review has included and continues to include streamlining the Company's manufacturing plants, co-packers and supply chain, eliminating served categories or brands within those categories, and product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating slow moving SKUs.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company announced a new transformation initiative, of which one aspect is to identify additional areas of productivity savings to support sustainable profitable performance.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn March 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to sell all of the operations of the Hain Pure Protein Corporation ( HPPC\u201d) and EK Holdings, Inc. ( Empire Kosher\u201d or Empire\u201d) operating segments, which were reported in the aggregate as the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment. These dispositions were undertaken to reduce complexity in the Company's operations and simplify the Company's brand portfolio, in addition to allowing additional flexibility to focus on opportunities for growth and innovation in the Company's more profitable and faster growing core businesses.\nCollectively, these dispositions represented a strategic shift that had a major impact on the Company's operations and financial results and have been accounted for as discontinued operations.\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used primarily for the Plainville Farms business (a component of HPPC).\nOn June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. which includes the FreeBird and Empire Kosher businesses.\nSee Note 5, Discontinued Operations,in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan\nOn June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) succession plan, whereby the Company's former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. On October 26, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mark L. Schiller as President and CEO, succeeding Mr. Simon. In connection with the appointment, on October 26, 2018, the Company and Mr. Schiller entered into an employment agreement, which was approved by the Board, with Mr. Schiller's employment commencing on November 5, 2018. Accordingly, Mr. Simon's employment with the Company terminated on November 4, 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2019 to Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2018\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table compares our results of operations, including as a percentage of net sales, on a consolidated basis, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 (amounts in thousands, other than percentages which may not add due to rounding):\n\n* Percentage is not meaningful\nNet Sales\nNet sales in fiscal 2019 were $2.30 billion, a decrease of $155.3 million, or 6.3%, from net sales of $2.46 billion in fiscal 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $52.6 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased approximately 4.2% from the prior year. Net sales decreased across all three of our reportable segments. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2019 was $445.2 million, a decrease of $70.2 million, or 13.6%, from gross profit of $515.4 million in fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin was 19.3%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by an inventory write-down of $12.4 million in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs primarily in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative, higher trade and promotional investments and increased freight and commodity costs primarily in the United States segment. These increased costs were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $340.9 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.2%, in fiscal 2019 from $341.6 million in fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower marketing investment costs in the United States, the reversal of previously accrued amounts under the net sales portion of the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 LTIPs and the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the relative TSR portion of the 2017-2019 LTIP due to specified performance metrics not being attained. See Note 14, Stock-based Compensation and Incentive Performance Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the aforementioned reversals under the Company's LTIPs. This decrease was offset in part by increased consulting costs in the United States, as well as increased variable compensation costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.8% in fiscal 2019 and 13.9% in the prior year, an increase of 90 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles was $15.3 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 16.0%, from $18.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to finite-lived intangibles from certain historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized subsequent to June 30, 2018.\nProject Terra Costs and Other\nProject Terra costs and other was $40.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $22.1 million from $18.0 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's Project Terra strategic review as well as increased severance costs in fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year period.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, net\nOn June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer succession plan, whereby the Company's former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. Net costs and expenses associated with the Company's Chief Executive Officer succession plan were $30.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $0.5 million in fiscal 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProceeds from Insurance Claims\nIn July of 2019, the Company received $7.0 million as partial payment from an insurance claim relating to business disruption costs associated with a co-packer. Of this amount $4.5 million was recognized in fiscal 2019 as it relates to reimbursement of costs already incurred. The Company will record an additional $2.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAccounting Review and Remediation Costs, net of Insurance Proceeds\nCosts and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $4.3 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2018. Included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were insurance proceeds of $0.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively, related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee and other related matters.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our Hain Ventures reporting unit within the Rest of World segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2019. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $17.9 million ($11.3 million related to the United States segment, $3.8 million related to the Rest of World segment and $2.8 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain tradenames of the Company. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company recorded $8.7 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to the Company's decision to consolidate manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in the United States and United Kingdom, some of which was used to manufacture certain slow moving SKUs that were discontinued.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at three of its manufacturing facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives due to the Company's decision to utilize third-party manufacturers for two facilities in the United States and to the closure of one facility to consolidate manufacturing of certain soup products in the United Kingdom. As such, the Company recorded a $6.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to the closures of these facilities. Additionally, the Company discontinued additional slow moving SKUs in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative. As a result, expected future cash flows are not expected to support the carrying value of certain machinery and equipment used to manufacture these products. As such, the Company recorded a $2.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of these assets to fair value. Also, during fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million related to the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain trade names of the Company.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nOperating loss in fiscal 2019 was $14.9 million compared to operating income of $106.0 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income resulted from the items described above.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, net\nInterest and other financing expense, net totaled $36.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $9.2 million, or 34.0%, from $26.9 million in the prior year. The increase in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from higher interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of higher variable interest rates. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther Expense/(Income), net\nOther expense/(income), net totaled $1.0 million of expense in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $3.1 million from $2.1 million of income in the prior year. Included in other expense/(income), net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were net unrealized foreign currency losses, which were higher than the prior year period principally due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated loans.\n(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss (Income) of Equity-Method Investees\nLoss before income taxes and equity in the net loss of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2019 was $52.0 million compared to income of $81.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to the items discussed above.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was $2.7 million and $0.9 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which significantly revised the ongoing U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time tax on foreign unremitted earnings and setting limitations on deductibility of certain costs (e.g., interest expense and executive compensation), among other things.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 required that the Company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company was allowed a\nmeasurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded an additional expense of $6.8 million related to its transition tax liability. The net increase in the transition tax was due to the finalization of the Company's earnings and profits study for the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The adjustment of the Company's provisional tax expense was recorded as a change in estimate in accordance with SAB No. 118. Despite the completion of the Company's accounting for Tax Act under SAB 118, many aspects of the law remain unclear, and the Company expects ongoing guidance to be issued at both the federal and state levels. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the impact of any new developments.\nThe Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A Topic No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the resulting tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The Company has computed the impact on our effective tax rate on a discrete basis.\nThe effective income tax benefit rate from continuing operations was 5.2% and 1.1% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, state taxes, provisions in the Tax Act including global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), finalization of the transition tax liability, and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by a net increase of $9.8 million in the Company's valuation allowance primarily related to the Company's state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of executive officers' compensation, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nOur effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.\nSee Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEquity in Net Loss (Income) of Equity-Method Investees\nOur equity in the net loss from our equity method investments for fiscal 2019 was $0.7 million compared to equity in net income of $0.3 million for fiscal 2018. See Note 15, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\nNet loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 was $49.9 million compared to net income of $82.4 million for fiscal 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $0.48 in fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.79 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was attributable to the factors noted above.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\nNet loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $133.4 million and $72.7 million, respectively, or $1.28 and $0.70 per diluted share, respectively. The increase in net loss from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to asset impairment charges of $109.3 million and losses on sale in connection with the disposition of the Plainville Farms and HPPC businesses of $40.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in each case recorded in fiscal 2019 and discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss for fiscal 2019 was $183.3 million compared to net income of $9.7 million for fiscal 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $1.76 in fiscal 2019 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.09 in 2018. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $191.4 million and $255.9 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation of our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\n\nUnited States\nOur net sales in the United States in fiscal 2019 were $1.01 billion, a decrease of $75.5 million, or 7.0%, from net sales of $1.08 billion in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by declines in our Pantry, Better-For-You-Baby, Fresh Living and Personal Care platforms. In addition, the declines were also driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins. Operating income in the United States in fiscal 2019 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $62.5 million, or 72.4%, from $86.3 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was the result of the aforementioned decrease in net sales, higher trade investments to drive future period growth, increased freight and logistics costs, start-up costs incurred in connection with a new manufacturing facility, inventory write-downs of $8.3 million in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs as part of a product rationalization initiative and a $6.5 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in fiscal 2019, offset in part by Project Terra cost savings.\nUnited Kingdom\nOur net sales in the United Kingdom in fiscal 2019 were $885.5 million, a decrease of $52.5 million, or 5.6%, from net sales of $938.0 million in fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 1.8% from the prior year. The net sales decrease on a constant currency basis was primarily due to declines from the New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae and Johnson's Juice Co.\u2122 brands and private label sales, offset in part by growth in the Company's Tilda and Ella's Kitchen businesses and growth in our Hartley's\u00ae brand. Operating income in the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2019 was $52.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6.5%, from $56.0 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales and a $8.7 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the consolidation of manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in fiscal 2019, partially offset by operating efficiencies achieved at Hain Daniels driven by Project Terra.\nRest of World\nOur net sales in Rest of World were $407.6 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $27.3 million, or 6.3%, from net sales of $434.9 million in fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.5% from the prior year. The decrease in net sales on a constant currency basis was primarily due to declines in Canada from the Company's Europe's Best\u00ae and Dream\u00ae brands and private label sales, partially offset by growth in our Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae, Sensible Portions\u00ae and Live Clean\u00ae brands. Hain Ventures (formerly known as Cultivate Ventures) net sales decreased from the prior year, primarily driven by declines from the Blueprint\u00ae, SunSpire\u00ae and DeBoles\u00ae brands, offset in part by growth from the GG UniqueFiber\u2122 brand. Declines in Canada and Hain Ventures were offset by growth in Hain Europe primarily driven by increased sales from the Joya\u00ae and Natumi\u00ae brands and private label sales, partially offset by declines from the Danival\u00ae, Lima\u00ae and Dream\u00ae brands. Operating income in Rest of World for fiscal 2019 was $32.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million, or 15.1%, from $38.7 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales, charges related to SKU rationalizations across all operating segments in Rest of World, start-up costs incurred in connection with a new manufacturing facility in Canada and costs associated with the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in the United States due to the Company's decision to utilize a third-party manufacturer.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan expense, net, Project Terra costs and other and accounting review and remediation costs, net are included in Corporate and Other and were $30.2 million, $28.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Corporate and Other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 also includes trade name impairment charges of $17.9 million and a benefit of $4.5 million recorded in connection with proceeds received for an insurance claim. Corporate and Other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included Project Terra costs and other and accounting review and remediation costs of $10.1 million and $9.3 million (net of $5.7 million of insurance proceeds), respectively. Corporate and Other also included impairment charges of $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.\nRefer to Note 19, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nComparison of Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2018 to Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table compares our results of operations, including as a percentage of net sales, on a consolidated basis, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, other than percentages which may not add due to rounding):\n\n* Percentage is not meaningful\nNet Sales\nNet sales in fiscal 2018 were $2.46 billion, an increase of $114.3 million, or 4.9%, from net sales of $2.34 billion in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $80.0 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased approximately 1.5% from the prior year period. The increase in net sales was due to sales growth in the United Kingdom, Europe and Canada businesses, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the United States segment. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2018 was $515.4 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 0.8%, from gross profit of $519.4 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted gross margin by $15.9 million as compared to the prior year. Gross profit margin was 21.0%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by decreased gross profit in the United States due to increased commodity and freight and logistics costs, increased trade investment and costs associated with the aforementioned SKU rationalization and higher commodity costs in the United Kingdom. These increased\ncosts were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings and higher profit achieved on higher net sales in the United Kingdom and the Rest of World segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $341.6 million, an increase of $29.1 million, or 9.3%, in fiscal 2018 from $312.6 million in fiscal 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased principally due to higher marketing investment primarily in the United States and personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 13.9% in fiscal 2018 and 13.3% in the prior year, an increase of 60 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles was $18.2 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $1.2 million, or 7.1%, from $17.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the intangibles acquired as a result of the Company's recent acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rates. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nProject Terra Costs and Other\nWe incurred Project Terra costs and other of $18.0 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $7.6 million from $10.4 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased severance costs in the current year period as compared to the prior year period related to the closures of two of the Company's manufacturing facilities in the United States and one manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's Project Terra strategic review.\nChief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, net\nNet costs and expenses associated with the Company's Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan were $0.5 million in fiscal 2018. There were no such costs incurred in fiscal 2017. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting Review and Remediation Costs, Net of Insurance Proceeds\nCosts and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $15.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $29.6 million in fiscal 2017. Also, included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2018 were insurance proceeds of $5.7 million related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee of the Company and other related matters. The net amount of accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2018 was $9.3 million.\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million related to our Hain Ventures reporting unit within the Rest of World segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2017. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at three of its manufacturing facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives due to the Company's decision to utilize third-party manufacturers for two facilities in the United States and to the closure of one facility to consolidate manufacturing of certain soup products in the United Kingdom. As such, the Company recorded a $6.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to the closures of these facilities. Additionally, the Company discontinued additional slow moving SKUs in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative. As a result, expected future cash flows are not expected to support the carrying value of certain machinery and equipment used to manufacture these products. As such, the Company recorded a $2.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of these assets to fair value. Also, during fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million related to the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million related to the United Kingdom segment) related to certain trade names of the Company.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $14.1 million ($7.6 million related to the United Kingdom segment and $6.5 million related to the United States segment) related to certain trade names of the Company. Additionally, during fiscal 2017, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $26.4 million primarily related to the decision to exit of certain portions of our own-label chilled desserts business in the United Kingdom. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 8, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in fiscal 2018 was $106.0 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 3.1%, from $109.4 million in fiscal 2017. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 4.3% in fiscal 2018 compared with 4.7% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales resulted from the items described above.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, net\nInterest and other financing expense, net totaled $26.9 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $5.8 million, or 27.5%, from $21.1 million in the prior year. The increase in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from higher interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of higher variable interest rates on outstanding debt. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther (Income)/Expense, net\nOther (income)/expense, net totaled $2.1 million of income in fiscal 2018, an increase of $2.5 million from $0.4 million of expense in the prior year. Included in other (income)/expense, net were net unrealized and realized foreign currency gains, which were higher in the current period than the prior year period principally due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany loans.\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Equity-Method Investees\nIncome before income taxes and equity in the net income of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $81.2 million and $87.9 million, respectively. The decrease was due to the items discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was $0.9 million for the fiscal 2018 compared to $22.5 million of tax expense in fiscal 2017.\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was (1.1)% and 25.6% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of executive officers' compensation, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28.1% for fiscal 2018 and a 21% U.S. federal statutory rate for subsequent fiscal years.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's SAB 118 requires that the Company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, the Company recorded the following reasonable estimates of the tax impact in its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.\n \u2022 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company accrued a $25.0 million provisional tax benefit related to the net change in deferred tax liabilities stemming from the Tax Act's reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, and disallowance of certain incentive based compensation tax deductibility under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). \n \u2022 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company accrued a reasonable estimate of $7.1 million of tax expense for the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on the foreign subsidiaries' accumulated, unremitted earnings going back to 1986. \nThe Company has recorded the final impact on the Company from the Tax Act's transition tax legislation in fiscal 2019. See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPursuant to SAB 118, the Company was allowed a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. The Company calculated the impact of the Tax Act and recorded any resulting tax adjustments during fiscal 2019.\nThe Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The Company will be subject to the GILTI provisions effective beginning July 1, 2018 and is in the process of analyzing its effects, including how to account for the GILTI provision from an accounting policy standpoint.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was also favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and a $4.0 million benefit relating to the release of the remainder of the Company's domestic uncertain tax position as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 was favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom enacted in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a $1.8 million decrease to the carrying balance of net deferred tax liabilities. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 was also favorably impacted by a $4.6 million benefit relating to the release of a portion of the Company's domestic uncertain tax position as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nOur effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.\nSee Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEquity in Net Income of Equity-Method Investees\nOur equity in the net income from our equity method investments for fiscal 2018 was $0.3 million compared to a $0.1 million for fiscal 2017. See Note 15, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations\nNet income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $82.4 million and $65.5 million, respectively, or $0.79 and $0.63 per diluted share, respectively. The increase was attributable to the factors noted above.\nNet (loss) Income from Discontinued Operations\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was net loss of $72.7 million and net income of $1.9 million, respectively, or $(0.70) and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively. The net loss for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to impairments of assets held for sale of $78.5 million in fiscal 2018 as discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, results for HPPC (which comprises the Plainville and FreeBird brands) were below our projections. The fourth quarter results, as well as negative market conditions in the sector, required the Company to reduce the internal projections for the business, which resulted in the Company lowering the projected long-term growth rate and profitability levels for HPPC. Accordingly, the updated projections indicated that the fair value of the HPPC business is below carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded asset impairments of $78.5 million, reflected in Net (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax in order to reduce the carrying amount of the net assets to their fair value less costs to sell. This impairment was partially offset by an increase in income tax benefit from discontinued operations from $0.6 million in fiscal 2017 to $5.7 million, which includes a $20.2 million deferred tax benefit arising from asset impairment charges and a $12.3 million deferred tax liability related to Hain Pure Protein being classified as held for sale in fiscal 2018.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $9.7 million and $67.4 million, or $0.09 and $0.65 per diluted share, respectively. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $255.9 million and $265.0 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\n\nUnited States\nOur net sales in the United States in fiscal 2018 were $1.08 billion, a decrease of $22.9 million, or 2.1%, from net sales of $1.11 billion in fiscal 2017. The decrease in net sales was driven by declines in our Better-for-You Snacking, Fresh Living and Better-for-You-Pantry platforms, partially offset by growth in our Pure Personal Care, Better-for-You Baby and Tea platforms. In addition, the declines were also driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins as the Company continues its focus on its top 500 SKUs and 11 brands in the United States as well as increased trade investment. Net sales in the prior year period were negatively impacted by a realignment of customer inventories at certain distributor customers. Operating income in the United States in fiscal 2018 was $86.3 million, a decrease of $59.0 million, or 40.6%, from operating income of $145.3 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income was the result of lower sales, higher trade and marketing investments to drive current and future period growth, increased freight and logistics, commodity and other input costs and costs associated with the closure of two of our manufacturing facilities in the United States. These increased costs were partially offset by Project Terra cost savings in the current period. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted in both periods by charges related to the initiation of SKU rationalizations.\nUnited Kingdom\nOur net sales in the United Kingdom in fiscal 2018 were $938.0 million, an increase of $86.3 million, or 10.1%, from net sales of $851.8 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $54.4 million as compared to the prior year. The net sales increase on a constant currency basis was primarily due to growth from our Tilda\u00ae, Ella's Kitchen\u00ae, Hartley's\u00ae, Cully & Sully\u00ae and Linda McCartney's\u00ae brands, partially offset by lower New Covent Garden Soup Co.\u00ae sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was the impact of price realization, as well as the acquisitions of The Yorkshire Provender Limited and Clarks. Operating income in the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2018 was $56.0 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 7.9%, from $51.9 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned\nincrease in sales, operating efficiencies achieved at Hain Daniels, Project Terra cost savings and the impact of favorable foreign currency. These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs, marketing investments and costs associated with the planned closure of a soup manufacturing facility.\nRest of World\nOur net sales in Rest of World were $434.9 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $50.9 million, or 13.3%, from net sales of $383.9 million in fiscal 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $25.5 million as compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales on a constant currency basis was primarily due to increased sales volume in Europe related to both branded and private label non-dairy products, as well as increased sales in Canada driven by growth in our Tilda\u00ae, Yves Veggie Cuisine\u00ae,Sensible Portions\u00ae and Live Clean\u00ae brands, partially offset by Europe's Best\u00ae lost distribution. Operating income in Rest of World for fiscal 2018 was $38.7 million, an increase of $6.7 million, or 20.8%, from $32.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in sales as well as operating efficiencies achieved at our plant-based manufacturing facilities in Europe, Project Terra cost savings and the impact of favorable foreign currency.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, Project Terra costs and other included in Corporate and Other totaled $10.1 million and $10.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Corporate and Other category also included accounting review costs of $9.3 million (net of $5.7 million of insurance proceeds) and $29.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and impairment charges of $13.3 million and $40.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRefer to Note 19, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings available to us under our Credit Agreement and Amended Credit Agreement (defined below).\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $67.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $39.5 million compared to $106.6 million at June 30, 2018. Our working capital was $318.6 million at June 30, 2019, a decrease of $310.5 million from $629.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018, which included current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations of $191.0 million.\nLiquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the Company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are held in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe and India. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 77.9% ($30.8 million) of the Company's total cash balance was held outside of the United States. It is our current intent to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the United States. However, we intend to further study changes enacted by the Tax Act, costs of repatriation and the current and future cash needs of foreign operations to determine whether there is an opportunity to repatriate foreign cash balances in the future on a tax-efficient basis.\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent. As of June 30, 2019, all of our investments were expected to mature in less than three months. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below. \nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $49.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to $121.3 million provided by in fiscal 2018 and $232.7 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 resulted primarily from a decrease of $126.9 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges, offset by $55.1 million of cash provided by within working capital accounts, primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $121.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to $232.7 million provided in fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from an additional $97.5 million of cash used within working capital accounts, primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease of $13.9 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges.\nCash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $70.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $77.1 million. We used cash in investing activities of $82.5 million during fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which was principally made up of $12.4 million, net of cash acquired, in connection with our Clarks UK Limited acquisition and $70.9 million for capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We used cash in investing activities of $60.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which was principally for the acquisitions of Better Bean and Yorkshire Provender and capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $44.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We had net debt repayments of $77.0 million funded primarily through proceeds received from the sale of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. Additionally, we paid $3.5 million during fiscal 2019 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $36.0 million of proceeds received from operations of discontinued operations. Net cash of $69.5 million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We had net debt repayments of $40.7 million funded primarily through cash flows from operations. Additionally, we paid $7.2 million during fiscal 2018 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $21.6 million to fund the operations of discontinued operations. Net cash of $147.1 million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. We had net repayments of $110.4 million funded primarily through cash flows from operations. Additionally, we paid $8.3 million during fiscal 2017 for stock repurchases to satisfy employee payroll tax withholdings and $25.9 million to fund the operations of discontinued operations.\nOperating Free Cash Flow\nOur operating free cash flow was negative $27.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $78.0 million from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in operating free cash flow primarily resulted from an increase in our capital expenditures of $6.2 million and a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $126.9 million, offset in part by cash provided within working capital accounts of $55.1 million. We expect that our capital spending for fiscal 2020 will be approximately $70-$80 million, and we may incur additional costs in connection with Project Terra. We refer the reader to the Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to operating free cash flow from continuing operations.\nCredit Agreement\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility through February 6, 2023 and provides for a $300.0 million term loan. Under the Credit Agreement, the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional uncommitted $400.0 million, provided certain conditions are met. Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate (both of which are defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin, which is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings may be used to provide working capital, finance capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions, refinance certain existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nOn May 8, 2019, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), whereby, among other things, its allowable consolidated leverage ratio increased to no more than 5.0 to 1.0 from March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2019, no more than 4.75 to 1.0 at March 31, 2020, no more than 4.25 to 1.0 at June 30, 2020 and no more than 4.0 to 1.0 on September 30, 2020 and thereafter. The allowable consolidated leverage ratio for each period was decreased by 0.25 upon sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, the Company's required consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) was reduced to no less than 3.0 to 1 through March 31, 2020, no less than 3.75 to 1 through March 31, 2021 and no less than 4.0 to 1 thereafter. The Amended Credit Agreement also required that the Company and the subsidiary guarantors enter into a Security and Pledge Agreement pursuant to which all of the obligations under Amended Credit Agreement are secured by liens on assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries, including stock of each of their direct subsidiaries and intellectual property, subject to agreed upon exceptions. Additionally, the Company is now required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of no less than 3.0 to 1 through March 31, 2020, no less than 3.75 to 1 through March 31, 2021 and no less than 4.0 to 1 thereafter. The allowable consolidated leverage ratio was decreased by 0.25 upon sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides that loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a rate ranging from 0.875% to 2.50% per annum; or (b) the Base Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a rate ranging from 0.00% to 1.50% per annum, the relevant rate being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. Swing line loans and Global Swing Line loans denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate, and Global Swing Line loans denominated in foreign currencies shall bear interest based on the overnight Eurocurrency Rate for loans denominated in such currency plus the Applicable Rate. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019 was 4.20%. Additionally, the Amended Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, on the amount unused under the Amended Credit Agreement ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid. As part of the Amended Credit Agreement, HPPC was released from its obligations as a borrower and a guarantor under the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Company's remaining Hain Pure Protein business and utilized proceeds from the sale, net of transaction related costs, to prepay a portion of the term loan. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on the sale of the Hain Pure Protein business.\nAs of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $626.8 million and $698.1 million of borrowings outstanding, respectively, under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nTilda Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements\nOur former Tilda business maintained short-term borrowing arrangements primarily used to fund the purchase of rice from India and other countries. The maximum borrowings permitted under all such arrangements were \u00a352.0 million. Outstanding borrowings were collateralized by the current assets of Tilda, typically had six-month terms and bore interest at variable rates typically based on LIBOR plus a margin (weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.38% at June 30, 2019). As of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, there were $8.7 million and $9.3 million of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements, respectively. On August 27, 2019, we sold our Tilda business as discussed in Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 21, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans,\nin private transactions or otherwise. The authorization does not have a stated expiration date. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this program in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017, and accordingly, as of the end of fiscal 2019, we had $250 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase program.\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures\nWe have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.\nFor each of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and Board of Directors believes the non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and Board of Directors uses the non-U.S. GAAP measure. These non-U.S. GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nConstant Currency Presentation\nWe believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.\nA reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales decrease in fiscal 2019 is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales increase in fiscal 2018 is as follows:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, equity in the earnings of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, Project Terra costs and other, and other non-recurring items. The Company's management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the\nCompany and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with U.S. GAAP results.\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: \nOperating Free Cash Flow\nIn our internal evaluations, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure operating free cash flow from continuing operations.\u201d The difference between operating free cash flow from continuing operations and cash flow provided by or used in operating activities from continuing operations, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that operating free cash flow from continuing operations reflects the impact of capital expenditures. Since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash provided by or used in operating activities. We view operating free cash flow from continuing operations as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments. We do not consider operating free cash flow from continuing operations in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nA reconciliation from cash flow provided by operating activities to Operating free cash flow is as follows: \nContractual Obligations\nObligations for all debt instruments, capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 are as follows:\n\n (1) Including principal and interest. \n (2) Excludes amounts that may be payable upon termination to co-packers as we are not able to reasonably estimate such amounts.  As of June 30, 2019, we had non-current unrecognized tax benefits of $11.9 million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows. As a result, this amount has not been included in the table above.\nWe believe that our cash on hand of $39.5 million at June 30, 2019 as well as projected cash flows from operations and availability under our Amended Credit Agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business, anticipated fiscal 2020 capital expenditures and other expected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates; however, materially different amounts\nmight be reported under different conditions or using assumptions, estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied. Our critical accounting policies, including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural foods stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. The majority of our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. Our customer contracts typically contain standard terms and conditions. In instances where formal written contracts are not in place we consider the customer purchase orders to be contracts based on the criteria outlined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Payment terms and conditions vary by customer and are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers, but we generally provide credit terms to customers ranging from 15-60 days; therefore, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.\nSales to customers generally do not include more than one performance obligation. When a contract does contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for each distinct good is generally determined by directly observable data.\nWe have determined that we satisfy our performance obligations related to our customer contracts at a point in time, as opposed to over time, and, accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time. Therefore, we do not have any contract balances with our customers recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSales includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of discounts, trade promotions and sales incentives, consumer coupon programs and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a fulfillment activity of our promise to transfer products to our customers and are included in cost of sales line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nVariable Consideration\nIn addition to fixed contract consideration, many of our contracts include some form of variable consideration. We offer various trade promotions and sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, slotting fees, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The expenses associated with these programs are accounted for as reductions to the transaction price of our products and are therefore deducted from our net sales to determine reported net sales. Trade promotions and sales incentive accruals are subject to significant management estimates and assumptions. The critical assumptions used in estimating the accruals for trade promotions and sales incentives include management's estimate of expected levels of performance and redemption rates. Management exercises judgment in developing these assumptions. These assumptions are based upon historical performance of the retailer or distributor customers with similar types of promotions adjusted for current trends. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions and incentives based on what has been incurred by the customers. The terms of most of our promotion and incentive arrangements do not exceed a year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorization process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. Differences between estimated expense and actual promotion and incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract\nAs our contracts are generally shorter than one year, the Company has elected a practical expedient under ASU 2014-09 that allows the Company to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the contract period is for one year or less. These costs are included in the selling, general and administrative expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDisaggregation of Net Sales\nThe Company does not disaggregate revenue below the segment revenues level disclosed in Note 17, Segment Information, as all revenues are recognized at a point in time and the Company's segment revenues depict how the economic factors affect the nature, amount, and timing and uncertainty of cash flows.\nValuation of Accounts and Chargeback Receivable\nWe perform routine credit evaluations on existing and new customers. We apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply an additional reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories. Credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years. While Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, Sam's Club and ASDA, together represented approximately 12% of accounts receivable, net at June 30, 2019, we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time.\nBased on cash collection history and other statistical analysis, we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken that we expect will be collectible and repaid in the near future and records a chargeback receivable. Differences between estimated collectible receivables and actual collections are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.\nWe may not have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions, or with changes in business conditions, such as consolidation within the food industry and/or a change in the way we market and sell our products.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nOur growth strategy has historically included the acquisition of numerous brands and businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to judgment as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nThe accounting for the acquisitions we have made requires that the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as any contingent consideration that may be part of the agreement, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. This requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values, especially with respect to intangible assets, including estimates of expected cash flows, expected cost savings and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. As a result of these significant judgments to be made, we occasionally obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate, it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change. See Note 6, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nFixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. We generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows. The assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability, our estimated working capital needs, as well as our weighted average cost of capital. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses. Estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The\namount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied\u201d fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. We measure the fair value of these assets using the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that the trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received. We estimate the future revenues for the associated brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, in conjunction with its budgeting and forecasting process for fiscal year 2020, and concluded that no indicators of impairment existed at any of its reporting units.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill was $1.01 billion. As of the 2019 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 20%, with the exception of the Tilda and Grocery and Snacks reporting units, whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by 13% and 8%, respectively. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, other than the Tilda reporting unit, to be in excess of the fair value. However, the fair values of the Hain Daniels, Grocery and Snacks and Hain Ventures reporting units would exceed their respective carrying values by less than 10%. The fair values were based on significant management assumptions including an estimate of future cash flow. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. The Company will continue to monitor impairment indicators and financial results in future periods.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $7.7 million in its Hain Ventures reporting unit primarily as a result of lowered projected long-term revenue growth rates and profitability levels.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated on an annual basis in conjunction with the Company's evaluation of goodwill, or on an interim basis if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its indefinite-life intangible assets below their carrying value. In assessing fair value, the Company utilizes a relief from royalty payments\u201d methodology. This approach involves two steps: (i) estimating the royalty rates for each trademark and (ii) applying these royalty rates to a projected net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed in certain of the Company's indefinite-lived tradenames. The result of this interim assessment indicated that the fair value of certain of the Company's tradenames was below their carrying value, and therefore an impairment charge of $17.9 million was recognized ($11.3 million in the United States segment, $3.8 million in the Rest of World segment and $2.8 million in the United Kingdom segment) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The result of the annual assessment for the year ended June 30, 2019 indicated that the fair value of the Company's trade names exceeded their carrying values and no indicators of impairment were present. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, a trade name impairment charge of $5.6 million ($5.1 million in the Rest of World segment and $0.5 million in the United Kingdom segment) was recorded. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, a trade name impairment charge of $14.1 million ($7.6 million in the United Kingdom segment and $6.5 million in the United States segment) was recorded.\nSee also Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee and non-employee directors services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition, which cliff vest, are recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. Stock-based compensation awards with service conditions only are also recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight-line method.\nFor awards that contain a market condition, expense is recognized over the defined or derived service period using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized for these awards on a straight-line basis over the service period, regardless of the eventual number of shares that are earned based upon the market condition, provided that each grantee remains an employee\nat the end of the performance period. Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the service period a grantee is no longer an employee.\nValuation Allowances for Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods. Deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years. Accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is more likely than not\u201d that the deductions, losses or credits will be used in the future. A valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met. Our determination of our valuation allowances is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses, primarily in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in Belgium, against which we have recorded valuation allowances. The losses in the United Kingdom were recorded prior to the acquisition of Daniels. Under current tax law in these jurisdictions, our carryforward losses have no expiration. During fiscal 2019, the Company released the valuation allowance on a majority of its U.K. net operating loss carryforwards as it is more likely than not that the losses are realizable.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we recorded a partial valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards as it is not more likely than not that the state tax attributes will be realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nSeasonality\nCertain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, baking products, hot cereal, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our prepared food and personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.", "item_7_tables": "Table 68: <table><tr><td> </td>

MD&A report:\n\n- Net sales in fiscal 2019 were $2.30 billion, down 6.3% from the prior year. The decrease was driven by declines across all three operating segments - United States, United Kingdom, and Rest of World. \n\n- Gross profit margin declined to 19.3% from 21.0% last year due to inventory write-downs, higher trade spending, increased freight and commodity costs, partially offset by Project Terra savings.\n\n- Operating loss was $14.9 million compared to income of $106 million last year. The decline was primarily due to lower sales, impairment charges, CEO succession plan costs, and Project Terra consulting fees.\n\n- Net loss from continuing operations was $49.9 million compared to income of $82.4 million last year. Loss per share was $0.48 versus income of $0.79 last year.\n\n- Net loss including discontinued operations was $183.3 million compared to net income of $9.7 million last year, due to asset impairment charges and losses on sale related to the discontinued Hain Pure Protein business. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA declined 25% to $191.4 million due to the sales declines and factors impacting operating income.\n\n- Operating cash flow was $49.5 million, down from $121.3 million last year, while capital expenditures were $77.1 million. Operating free cash flow was negative $27.6 million.\n\nIn summary, the company saw declines in sales, earnings, and cash flow during fiscal 2019 driven by competitive pressures in the natural/organic food industry. It continues to implement its transformation plan to simplify operations and reduce costs."}
