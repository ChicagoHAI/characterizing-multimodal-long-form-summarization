As of December 31, 2017, we had 100% interests in four producing mines: (1) Fire Creek (2) Midas mine and ore milling facility and (3) Hollister, all of which are located in the state of Nevada, USA, and (4) True North gold mine and mill located in Manitoba, Canada (\"True North\"). We also have a 100% interest in the Aurora mine and ore milling facility (\"Aurora\"), which is also located in Nevada, USA and a 100% interest in the Ogama-Rockland gold exploration property located in Manitoba, Canada. All of our mines are located in safe political jurisdictions.\nPrior to February 2014, our only mine was Fire Creek, and since that time, we have experienced growth in our annual gold and silver production, total assets, and workforce largely due to growth at Fire Creek and to the acquisitions of Midas (February 2014), True North (January 2016), and Hollister and Aurora (October 2016).\nGold and silver sales represent 100% of our revenues and the market prices of gold and silver significantly impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. Our primary strategy is to increase shareholder value by responsibly achieving our production, cost, and capital targets while attempting to extend our mine lives through development and exploration programs and reducing our costs through operational efficiencies. We also consider acquisitions or other arrangements in the normal course which strategically fit our future growth objectives.\nExecutive summary\nOur 2017 highlights included the following, which are discussed in further detail throughout this MD&A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Health, safety, and environmental - We remained committed to our most important core values by operating in an environmentally responsible manner while protecting the health and safety of our employees and contractors.

The Company issued a total of 1,956,126 shares.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 full year outlook\nThe following statements are based on our current expectations for fiscal year 2018 results. The statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.\nWe expect to produce between 186,000 and 202,000 GEOs during 2018 at an expected production cash cost per GEO sold of $675 to $725. Total production is not expected to be equally distributed by quarter during the year as higher levels of production are expected during the second and third quarters due to the processing of tailings. It is anticipated that production could vary 5,000 to 10,000 GEOs between the highest and lowest producing quarters. Production from the Fire Creek and Midas mines are expected to be consistent with 2017. Hollister mine production is expected to increase during the year as the benefit of processing the stock pile from 2017 is realized. In addition, Klondex has begun processing historical Hollister tailings at the Aurora mill and expects to realize incremental production from that operation during 2018. Production from the True North mine in Canada will decrease as mining operations have been suspended and most of the GEOs produced will come from the processing of tailings. Total all-in sustaining costs (AISC) are projected to be between $940 and $990 per gold ounce sold for 2018.\nWe expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be between $48 to $56 million, including $16 to $18 million of capital to be spent on the construction of a new tailings facility for the Midas mill. Total capital expenditures guidance consists of $36 to $42 million of sustaining and $12 to $14 million of non-sustaining capital. The majority of the capital is expected to be spent at Fire Creek as the Company continues underground expansion in the form of primary access development. Total exploration expense is planned to be $10 to $12 million and is expected to be spent on district and near mine exploration.\nBelow are tables summarizing key 2018 operating guidance:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gold Equivalent Ounces Produced(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Production Cash Costs per Gold Equivalent Ounce Sold(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capital Expenditures (thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 full year outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midas Mill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fire Creek\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hollister\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aurora\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nevada Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>True North\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative (thousands)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) This is a non-GAAP measure; refer to the Non-GAAP Performance Measures section of the MD&A for additional detail.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Includes share based compensation of approximately $4 million, a non-cash item.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have not reconciled forward-looking 2018 full year non-GAAP performance measures contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliations would require unreasonable efforts at this time to estimate and quantify, with a reasonable degree of certainty, various necessary GAAP components, including for example those related to future production costs, realized sales prices and the timing of such sales, timing and amounts of capital expenditures, metal recoveries, and corporate general and administrative amounts and timing, or others that\nmay arise during the year. These components and other factors could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures, which may differ significantly from their non-GAAP counterparts.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThis MD&A is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. The preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that are considered to be relevant at the time our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ, and such differences could be material.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires significant management judgments and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact our financial statements. Although other estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. For information on all of our significant accounting policies and additional estimates, see Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies and Note 3. Recent accounting pronouncements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet realizable value of production-related inventories\nEstimate required: Our production-related inventories include stockpiles, in-process, and dor\u00e9 finished goods, all of which are measured and carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated future sales price of production-related inventories in the ordinary course of business using period-end metal prices less the estimated costs to convert the inventories into a saleable product (less estimated selling costs). A change in metal price levels or estimated future costs of completion from those which were used in our year-end net realizable value calculations could result in, or contribute to, additional future write-downs of production-related inventories.\nImpact of change in estimate: We incorporated year-end metal prices for gold and silver of $1,297 and $16.87 per ounce, respectively, into our net realizable value calculations. At Midas, Hollister, and True North, lower metal prices and/or increases in estimated costs to complete would have a corresponding increase on the amount of write-downs recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Fire Creek did not have write downs and the estimated net realizable value of production-related inventories exceeded its cost by approximately 130%.\nAs discussed in Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the application of our lower of average cost or net realizable value accounting policy resulted in write-downs of production inventories at Midas and True North.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nEstimate required: Our long-lived assets, which consist of mineral properties, plant and equipment, are evaluated for recoverability annually and at interim periods as needed. A recoverability test is performed if triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events that may trigger a test for recoverability include significant adverse changes to projected revenues, increases in costs and capital expenditures, or future plans that may adversely impact our current or future operations and cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. Existing proven and probable reserves, value beyond proven and probable reserves, and mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included in estimates of future cash flows. An impairment is determined to exist if the total projected future cash flows on an undiscounted pretax basis are less than the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. An impairment loss is measured using discounted cash flows and recorded based on the excess carrying value of the impaired long-lived asset over its estimated fair value. The assumptions, projections, and probabilities used to determine estimates of future cash flows are consistent or reasonable in relation to internal budgets, projections, and life-of-mine plans. Any change in the assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in our impairment calculations could materially impact our financial statements.\nImpact of change in estimate: The most significant assumptions used in our 2017 impairment tests include estimates of future gold and silver ounces sold and long-term future average gold and silver selling prices. As of December 31, 2017, our projected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using average long-term gold and silver prices of $1,303 and $19.31 per ounce, respectively, exceeded the carrying values of the related long-lived asset groups by approximately 832% for Fire Creek, 132% for Midas, 213% for True North, and 222% for Hollister.\nWe did not experience any impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nBusiness combinations\nEstimate required: When accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase consideration transferred to the estimated fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities assumed, as well as the consideration transferred, requires us to make estimates about future cash flows from long-lived assets, valuation of deferred taxes, and asset retirement obligations using models and inputs, as of the acquisition date, which are comparable to our long-lived asset impairment analysis and estimates relating to valuation of common shares and warrants. Any change in the assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in our fair value calculations could materially impact our financial statements, including during a measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date.\nImpact of change in estimate: If we were to change inputs, assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in business combinations that determine the fair values of consideration transferred, assets acquired, or liabilities assumed, the amounts recorded in our financial statements could change.\nAs discussed in Note 4. Business combinations to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we completed two acquisitions over the last three years which were accounted for as business combinations.\nIncome taxes\nEstimate required: Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the United States and Canada. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecast operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies. Changes in valuation allowances are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined.\nImpact of change in estimate: As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded deferred tax assets of $1.1 million (net of a valuation allowance of $58.7 million for deferred tax assets). Our estimate of future taxable earnings is the most significant estimate that impacts deferred taxes, and if such estimate was changed, would result in a corresponding increase or decrease to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nSee Note 15.

During our mining activities, we may encounter mineralization not included in the mineral reserve estimate that, in the opinion of management, can be processed economically. Often-times, rather than leaving such mineralized ore for future extraction, we mine the area when encountered so as not to potentially sterilize or incur additional costs to re-access and mine the ore at a later date. In other instances, additional design work, rehabilitation, and/or underground development may be required to enable access to mineralization included in the mineral resource estimate. Due to the above, actual mined gold and gold equivalent grades can differ from those which are stated in the current mineral reserve estimate.\nConsolidated\nThe following table provides a summary of consolidated operating results for our producing properties which include our Nevada operations, Fire Creek, Midas, and Hollister (which began mining activities during the end of the first quarter of 2017), and our Canadian asset, True North, which was placed into production during the end of the third quarter of 2016.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Nevada operations produced 161,536 GEOs, an increase of 7% from 151,007 GEOs produced during 2016. Core operations at Fire Creek and Midas performed in line with expectations. Total GEOs produced were less than the lower end of the most recent guidance range primarily due to results from Hollister, which produced 7,371 GEOs compared to the low end of the guidance range of 21,000 GEOs. The Company deferred the processing of a majority of the mined Hollister ore as it continued to optimize recoveries at the Midas mill for this ore. The majority of stockpiles at the end of 2017 were from Hollister. Modifications to the Midas mill are underway and recoveries for the Hollister ore are approximately 80% with additional improvements expected.\nCanadian operations\nDuring 2017, at True North, we milled 216,978 ore tons, from mining operations, at an average milled head grade of 0.12 gold ounces per ton, producing 24,636 GEOs. We also processed 80,848 tons from the True North Tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton, producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces. Total production for the year was 27,919 GEOs, approximately 7,000 GEOs short of the low end of the revised guidance. This shortfall was due to mining lower than forecasted grades from True North. The lower\nmined grades are attributed to delays in waste development which postponed mining planned stopes in the 711/713 areas of the True North mine, excessive dilution from a hanging wall failure and negative model grade reconciliation.\nSubsequent to the reporting period, on January 9, 2018, we announced that following an extensive review of the operational performance at True North, management decided to place the mine under care and maintenance to review strategic options and to provide optionality at higher metal prices. This decision was largely based on the site's inability to achieve planned operating and cash flow targets in 2017 and to refocus our resources on our Nevada assets. We will continue to process tailings through the mill for the near future in order to maximize cash flow and offset expected care and maintenance costs.\nAll-in sustaining costs\nTotal Company all in sustaining costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,149 per gold ounce sold. For 2018, the Company expects to have all in sustaining costs for the year of $940 to $990 per gold ounce sold.

For the year, 123,754 tons were mined at a grade of 0.90 GEOs per ton. Fire Creek was able to increase production year-over-year due to increased ore tonnage mined and milled with consistently high grades. Over the past three years we have focused on completing the required development and drilling to responsibly increase Fire Creek's annual production through increased tonnage as it has the lowest cost structure in our portfolio due to its high grades. We have been able to increase and sustain the mining rate through additions in underground mining equipment and employees. Due largely to the grades at Fire Creek, we have been able to maintain a $479 production cash costs per GEO structure, which was slightly above the high end of our annual expectation of $450.\nSpending - 2017 spending was $26.0 million for capital and $2.8 million for exploration. Capital expenditures were slightly lower than annual expectation of $27 - 29 million.

For the year, 156,927 tons were mined at a grade of 0.33 GEOs per ton. Gold equivalent mill head grades increased 14.3% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to mining higher grade areas. Average mill head grades remained consistent to the mill head grades in 2015. We experience cost and recovery rate synergies from processing ore from Fire Creek and Hollister at Midas; however, during 2017, 2016 and 2015, production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization per GEO exceeded the price of gold and were subject to write downs. Mineral properties and depletion are amortized on a reserve gold equivalent ounces. (see Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nSpending - 2017 spending was $16.3 million for capital for both Midas mine and the Midas mill and came in line with our annual expectation of $15 - 18 million. For details of capital expenditures and the classification between sustaining and non-sustaining (growth) refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nMidas Mill (Nevada Operations)\nOre from Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister are processed at the Midas mill, which has a design capacity of 1,200 tons per day. Run-of-mine ore is crushed to 100% passing 1/2\" in a conventional two-stage crushing circuit which utilizes a primary jaw crusher and a secondary cone crusher with the circuit closed by a double deck vibrating screen. During 2017 the Company began to process Hollister ore at the Midas mill. The company converted four of the mill's leach tanks to carbon in leach (\"CIL\") to allow Hollister ore to be processed. The commissioning of the new CIL circuit is in process while the Company tests ore blends from the Nevada mines to yield the most favorable results. The Company is in a favorable position to now have three mines in Northern Nevada feeding one central mill, providing significant operating flexibility to optimize profitability.\nThe Company also added a tails thickener to the Midas mill. The addition of the thickener will extend the life of the tailings facilities and reduce future capital expenditures for tailing facilities following the completion of the 2018 expansion. The Company anticipates $16 to $18 million of capital to be spent in 2018 on the expansion of the tailings facility at the Midas mill.\nHollister (Nevada Operations)\nThe Hollister mine is a fully-permitted past producing underground and open pit operation, located in north-central Nevada in Elko County. Hollister does not have milling or processing facilities but is located approximately 17 miles away from the Midas mill, which currently has capacity to process additional tons. Hollister is an important asset to us since we believe there are significant synergies and cost savings with our Nevada operations through low transportation costs, reduced per ton milling costs, and shared general and administrative costs. Further, certain of our executives and management previously operated the historical underground operations and exploration programs at Hollister and believe that exploration targets with significant potential exist within the property boundary. We believe Hollister provides us with an opportunity to strategically and responsibly grow our business in Nevada, a mining friendly jurisdiction, while leveraging our technical expertise in narrow-vein underground mining and past experience with the project.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mine Operations - Hollister\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ore tons mined\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold equivalent mined head grade (oz/ton)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent mined (oz)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold mined (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver mined (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ore tons milled\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold equivalent mill head grade (oz/ton)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold mill head grade (oz/ton)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average silver mill head grade (oz/ton)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold recovery rate (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average silver recovery rate (%)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent produced (oz)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold produced (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver produced (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent sold (oz)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold sold (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver sold (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and realized prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold revenue (000s)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver revenue (000s)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues (000s)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized gold price ($/oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized silver price ($/oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP Measures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production cash costs per GEO sold(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Gold equivalent measures are the gold measure plus the silver measure divided by a GEO ratio.

For the quarter, Hollister mined 20,440 tons at a grade of 0.44 GEOs per ton. For the year, Hollister mined 66,453 tons at a grade of 0.38 GEOs per ton. In 2017, recovered GEOs were 7,371. Sold GEOs for the year totaled 5,281 GEOs. Stockpiles at the end of 2017 contained approximately 15,000 GEOs from 44,000 tons at a GEO grade of 0.40 ounces per ton.\nMetallurgical test work is being performed to identify processing improvements to increase the gold and silver recoveries of the Hollister ore processed through the Midas mill. The recent mill modification, eliminating all cyanide in the grinding circuit, planned for the fourth quarter was not finished until the first week of January 2018. As a result, the decision was made to stockpile the Hollister ore during the fourth quarter in order to limit the risk of lower mill recoveries and less revenue. In 2018, the Company has already milled approximately 15,000 tons of Hollister ore at estimated gold and silver grades of 0.48 and 3.20 ounces per ton, respectively. Gold and silver recoveries for that material are estimated at approximately 80% and 60%, respectively. Ongoing metallurgical test work supports that gold recoveries of 85-90% can be achieved with additional modifications to the Midas mill circuit, including increasing leach time and finer grinding. Design and engineering of these modifications are being evaluated but are expected to be achievable with minimal capital investments.\nSpending - During the year ended December 31, 2017 total capital spending was $6.7 million and development and project costs totaled $10.6 million. For details of capital expenditures refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nCommunity - On August 17, 2017, the Company completed the donation of the Rock Creek lands, (more than 3,200 acres of lands), to the Battle Mountain Band of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada.\nAurora updates\nAurora project overview\nThe Aurora project is a fully-permitted past producing underground and open pit operation, located in west-central Nevada in Mineral County. Aurora has a 350 ton per day milling and processing facility, which provides us an opportunity to reprocess tailings from an existing tailing facility on the property and to consider toll milling services.

This decision was largely based on the site's inability to achieve planned operating and cash flow targets in 2017 and to refocus the Company's resources on Nevada assets. The Company will continue to process tailings through the mill for the near future in order to maximize cash flow and offset expected care and maintenance costs.\nThe Company recognized write-downs to production inventories of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nSpending - For the year ended December 31, 2017, spending was $14.5 million for capital and $0.2 million for exploration. For details of capital expenditures refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nFinancial position, liquidity, and capital resources\nGeneral strategy\nTo maintain sufficient liquid assets and access to capital resources, we regularly perform short and long-term cash flow forecasts using current assumptions of future gold and silver prices, foreign exchange rates, production volumes, and operating, exploration, development and capital costs. Our liquidity and capital resources management strategy entails a disciplined approach by monitoring the timing and amount of any investment in our mines, projects, or exploration properties, while continually remaining in a position which we believe will allow us to respond to changes in our business environment, such as a decrease in metal prices, or other factors beyond our control.\nOur capital structure consists of a mixture of debt and shareholders' equity. We regularly review our capital structure and evaluate various financing options and strategies that: (1) may improve our current liquidity and financial condition, (2) are attainable on favorable and reasonable terms, and (3) are permissible under our existing debt arrangements and other obligations. Such financing options may include, but are not limited to, additional or increases in revolving borrowing facilities, equipment financing, term loan facilities, refinancing existing obligations, and/or the issuance of equity securities, warrants, or other instruments.\nRisk management contracts\nIn order to increase the certainty of expected future cash flows, from time to time we may enter into financial instruments for a portion of our forecast gold and silver sales over the next one to twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into forward trades which covered 171,036 and 1,084,896 gold and silver ounces at average prices of $1,261 and $17.24, respectively. Additionally, we entered into various short-term zero cost gold collars during the year. The collars ranged in floor and ceiling prices and in quantity of ounces. As of December 31, 2017, all gold forward trades and collars had either expired, were sold, or were executed and we did not have any outstanding (see Note 11. Derivatives to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail). Other than the aforementioned, we have not entered into any other significant contracts to hedge or manage market risks arising from changes in metal prices, diesel and propane costs, and currency and interest rates. We will continually and actively monitor applicable markets and quotes and may consider entering into additional hedging agreements and contracts if determined to be advantageous by management and the Board, and if such transactions are permissible under our existing debt agreements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs discussed below in the Sources and uses of cash section, at December 31, 2017, our Cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $23.7 million, decreasing $24.0 million from the December 31, 2016 balance of $47.6 million largely due to investing cash outflows of $66.4 million primarily related to capital expenditures, which were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $26.4 million and cash provided by financing activities of $15.7 million.\nDue to the nature of our operations and the composition of our balance sheet assets, as of December 31, 2017, our current assets, which included Cash and cash equivalents of $23.7 million and Inventories of $42.6 million, represented substantially all of our liquid assets on hand. We have access to additional liquidity under our $40.0 million Revolver, of which $5.0 million was available as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $37.4 million. The following chart provides a summary of our working capital, Revolver availability, and estimated liquidity for the last three years (in thousands):\nOur working capital increased by $4.2 million (approximately 12.57%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and our working capital ratio increased to 2.02. The following table summarizes working capital (in thousands, except working capital ratio):\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Current assets divided by current liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking capital changes related to the decrease in total current assets were primarily attributable to a $24.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents (discussed below in the Sources and uses of cash section), offset by a $21.3 million increase in inventory primarily as a result of Hollister operations stockpiling ore during its ramp up throughout the year ended December 31, 2017. Working capital changes related to the decrease in total current liabilities were primarily attributable to a decrease in current debt as a result of the repayment of the Gold Purchase Agreement during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncluded in working capital are Inventories, which include production-related inventories that can provide us with additional cash liquidity in excess of their December 31, 2017 carrying value of $33.3 million due to a cash margin we expect to realize at the time of sale. The following table summarizes the estimated recoverable gold and silver ounces contained in our Inventories and the underlying amount of revenue which may be generated from their sale using December 31, 2017 period-end prices, which would be further reduced for any remaining processing and refining costs (in thousands, except ounces and period-end prices):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Silver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated ounces in Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period-end prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur December 31, 2017 working capital, available sources of liquidity, and future operating cash flows will be used, in part, to fund recurring operating and production costs, make principal and interest payments on debt, and to fund capital expenditures and exploration and development costs at our mines and projects. At current gold and silver price levels, and when using our estimates of future production and costs, we believe our cash flows from operating activities together with our working capital and Revolver, will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next 12 months.

Generally speaking, when the US dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, we experience negative foreign currency translation adjustments on our Canadian dollar cash balances (the opposite is true when the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar). Changes in exchange rates resulted in an increase to our cash balance of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreases to our cash balances of $1.6 million and $3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table provides a listing of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Revolver(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Amounts reflect the repayment of principal drawn and related cash interest on the Revolver through its current maturity date of December 31, 2019.

In addition to the above, our mines and projects are subject to certain royalty commitments as disclosed in Note 21. Commitments and contingencies.\nDebt covenants\nOur debt agreements contain certain representations and warranties, restrictions, events of default, and covenants, customary for agreements of these types. Additionally, the Revolver contains financial covenants which require us to maintain a Tangible Net Worth not less than $100.0 million, a Gearing Ratio (a measure of debt to EBITDA) not greater than 4.00:1, a Cash Balance not less than $10.0 million, and a Current Ratio not less than 1.10:1 (as such terms are defined in the Revolver). The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nOutstanding share capital\nAs of March 9, 2018, there were 179,614,947 common shares, 4,033,138 options, 10,001,242 warrants, 1,390,342 RSUs, 507,633 PSUs outstanding, and 195,547,302 common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNon-GAAP performance measures\nWe have included the non-GAAP measures \"Cash revenue from operations\", \"Cash production costs from operations\", \"Cash margin from operations\", \"Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\", \"All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\" and \"All-in costs per gold ounce sold\" in this MD&A (collectively, the \"Non-GAAP Measures\"). These Non-GAAP Measures are used internally to assess our operating and economic performance and to provide key performance information to management. We believe that these Non-GAAP Measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flows required to fund and sustain our business. These Non-GAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These Non-GAAP Measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP, and therefore may not be comparable to or consistent with measures used by other issuers or with amounts presented in our financial statements.\nOur primary business is gold production and our current and future operations, development, exploration, and life-of-mine plans primarily focus on maximizing returns from such gold production. As a result, our Non-GAAP Measures are calculated and disclosed on a per gold or gold equivalent ounce basis.\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold presents our cash costs associated with the production of gold equivalent ounces and, as such, non-cash depreciation and depletion charges are excluded. Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis, and includes all direct and indirect operating costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (State of Nevada net proceeds and other such taxes are excluded). We believe that converting the benefits from selling silver ounces into gold ounces is helpful to analysts and investors as it best represents the way we operate, which is to maximize returns from gold production. Gold equivalent ounces are computed using the number of silver ounces required to generate the revenue derived from the sale of one gold ounce, using average realized selling prices (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nevada Total(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>True North\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nevada Total(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>True North\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nevada Total(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized price per gold ounce sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized price per silver ounce sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver ounces equivalent to revenue from one gold ounce\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver ounces sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>984,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,708,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GEOs from silver ounces sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold ounces sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent ounces\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Write-down of production inventories (cash portion) (see Note 5 -

The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.\nOur calculation of AISC per gold ounce sold is consistent with the June 2013 guidance released by the World Gold Council, a non-regulatory, non-profit market development organization for the gold industry. AISC per gold ounce sold reflects the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project, including costs required to discover and develop new sources of production; therefore, capital amounts related to expansion and growth projects are included.\nAISC per gold ounce sold includes all: (1) direct and indirect operating cash costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) asset retirement and accretion expenses, and (4) sustaining capital expenditures, the total of which is reduced for revenues earned from silver sales. Certain cash expenditures, including State of Nevada net proceeds and other related taxes, federal tax payments, and financing costs are excluded.\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold includes additional costs which reflect the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") contains forward-looking statements (as previously defined) which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as more fully described in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&A provides a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and includes the Company's subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our other reports filed with the SEC as well as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion has been prepared based on information available to us as of March 14, 2018. All dollar amounts included in this MD&A are expressed in thousands of United States dollars unless otherwise noted. References to CDN$ refer to Canadian dollars. References to \"Notes\" refer to the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn this MD&A, we use the non-GAAP performance measures \"Cash revenue from operations\", \"Cash production costs from operations\", \"Cash margin from operations\", \"Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\", \"All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\" and \"All-in costs per gold ounce sold\", which should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the Non-GAAP performance measures section of this MD&A for additional detail.\nOverview\nOur discussion and analysis consists of the following subsections:\n \u2022 Introduction and strategy which provides a brief discussion of our current operations and business strategies and goals; \n \u2022 Executive summary which lists significant matters related to 2017; \n \u2022 2018 full year outlook which summarizes our estimates for 2018 production volumes, costs, and capital, development, and exploration spending; \n \u2022 Critical accounting estimates which provides a discussion of accounting estimates that we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because they affect reported amounts and require significant management judgment and assumptions about highly uncertain matters; \n \u2022 Results of operations which provides a discussion and analysis of our operating results for the last three years; \n \u2022 Mining operations review which provides a discussion of our mine operations and production statistics for the last three years. \n \u2022 Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources which provides a discussion of our cash flows (last three years), liquidity, available sources of liquidity, capital requirements, and debt covenants; and \n \u2022 Non-GAAP performance measures which includes a description of our three non-GAAP financial measures: production cash costs per GEO sold, all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold, and all-in costs per gold ounce sold, the reasons for our use of such measures, and a three year reconciliation to our nearest GAAP measures.  Introduction and strategy\nWe are a junior-tier gold and silver mining company focused on exploration, development, and production in a safe, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective manner. As of December 31, 2017, we had 100% interests in four producing mines: (1) Fire Creek (2) Midas mine and ore milling facility and (3) Hollister, all of which are located in the state of Nevada, USA, and (4) True North gold mine and mill located in Manitoba, Canada (\"True North\"). We also have a 100% interest in the Aurora mine and ore milling facility (\"Aurora\"), which is also located in Nevada, USA and a 100% interest in the Ogama-Rockland gold exploration property located in Manitoba, Canada. All of our mines are located in safe political jurisdictions.\nPrior to February 2014, our only mine was Fire Creek, and since that time, we have experienced growth in our annual gold and silver production, total assets, and workforce largely due to growth at Fire Creek and to the acquisitions of Midas (February 2014), True North (January 2016), and Hollister and Aurora (October 2016).\nGold and silver sales represent 100% of our revenues and the market prices of gold and silver significantly impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. Our primary strategy is to increase shareholder value by responsibly achieving our production, cost, and capital targets while attempting to extend our mine lives through development and exploration programs and reducing our costs through operational efficiencies. We also consider acquisitions or other arrangements in the normal course which strategically fit our future growth objectives.\nExecutive summary\nOur 2017 highlights included the following, which are discussed in further detail throughout this MD&A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n \u2022 Health, safety, and environmental - We remained committed to our most important core values by operating in an environmentally responsible manner while protecting the health and safety of our employees and contractors. As of December 31, 2017, we had operated 1,903 days (~5.2 years) at Fire Creek, 1,182 days (~3.2 years) at Midas, 53 days (~0.1 years) at True North, and 454 days (~1.2 years) at Hollister and Aurora, without a lost-time injury. During 2017, we had one lost-time injury at True North. Prior to this, True North had operated for nearly two years without a lost-time injury. \n \u2022 Consolidated performance - We mined a total of 222,233 GEOs. Mined ounces are calculated using tons hauled from underground to surface (or tons hauled from tailings) multiplied by the assays from production sampling. We produced a total of 189,456 GEO's, an increase of 17% from 161,289 GEOs produced during 2016. \n \u2022 Nevada performance - At Fire Creek, Midas, and Hollister, we mined 356,697 ore tons during the year at an average mined head grade of 0.53 GEOs per ton. Nevada operations mined 190,409 GEOs. Production cash costs per GEO sold in Nevada was $692. The Company began processing Hollister ore at the Midas mill at the end of the third quarter with process optimization ongoing. \n \u2022 Fire Creek - We mined 123,754 ore tons from Fire Creek in the year at an average mined head grade of 0.90 GEO per ton, producing 108,126 GEOs, in-line with guidance for the year. \n \u2022 Midas - The Midas mine also performed in-line with guidance for the year. For the year, we mined 156,927 ore tons at an average mined head grade of 0.33 GEO per ton. Produced ounces for the year were 45,062 GEOs. \n \u2022 Hollister - The Hollister mine development continued to increase in the fourth quarter, mining over 9,000 GEOs. For the year, Hollister mined 66,453 tons at a grade of 0.38 GEOs per ton containing 25,464 GEOs. Produced ounces for the year was 7,371 GEOs. Stockpiles at the end of 2017 contained approximately 15,000 GEOs from 44,000 tons at a GEO grade of 0.40 ounces per ton. \n \u2022 True North - At True North in Canada, we mined 228,495 ore tons from mining operations at an average mine head grade of 0.12 gold ounces per ton (3.73 grams per tonne) producing 24,636 GEOs. We also milled 80,848 tons from the True North tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton (1.24 grams per tonne) producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces. This production was approximately 7,000 GEOs short of the low end of the revised guidance for the year. This shortfall was due to mining lower than forecasted grades. \n \u2022 Ounces sold and financial results - We sold 190,865 GEOs, consisting of 177,402 gold ounces and 984,176 silver ounces. Revenue was $240.7 million from average realized selling prices per gold and silver ounce of $1,261 and $17.26, respectively. Net loss was $23.7 million ($0.13 loss per share - basic and diluted). \n \u2022 Cash flows and liquidity - Our ending cash balance was $23.7 million after $26.4 million of operating cash flows, $66.4 million used in investing activities, and $15.7 million provided by financing activities. Ending working capital was $37.4 million and total liquidity was $42.4 million when including the $5.0 million of Revolver availability. \n \u2022 Spending - Capital, exploration, and development spending totaled $28.7 million at Fire Creek, $16.7 million at Midas including the Midas mill, $22.1 million at Hollister, $2.7 million at Aurora, $14.7 million at True North, and $0.6 million at corporate for total capital, exploration and development spending of $85.6 million. \n \u2022 Acquisition - On October 19, 2017, the Company completed its arrangement with Bison Gold Resources Inc. (\"Bison Gold\"), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the common shares of Bison Gold. Under the terms of the Arrangement, each former Bison Gold shareholder received 0.1242 of a common share of Klondex for each Bison Gold common share held prior to the arrangement. The Company issued a total of 1,956,126 shares. \n2018 full year outlook\nThe following statements are based on our current expectations for fiscal year 2018 results. The statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.\nWe expect to produce between 186,000 and 202,000 GEOs during 2018 at an expected production cash cost per GEO sold of $675 to $725. Total production is not expected to be equally distributed by quarter during the year as higher levels of production are expected during the second and third quarters due to the processing of tailings. It is anticipated that production could vary 5,000 to 10,000 GEOs between the highest and lowest producing quarters. Production from the Fire Creek and Midas mines are expected to be consistent with 2017. Hollister mine production is expected to increase during the year as the benefit of processing the stock pile from 2017 is realized. In addition, Klondex has begun processing historical Hollister tailings at the Aurora mill and expects to realize incremental production from that operation during 2018. Production from the True North mine in Canada will decrease as mining operations have been suspended and most of the GEOs produced will come from the processing of tailings. Total all-in sustaining costs (AISC) are projected to be between $940 and $990 per gold ounce sold for 2018.\nWe expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be between $48 to $56 million, including $16 to $18 million of capital to be spent on the construction of a new tailings facility for the Midas mill. Total capital expenditures guidance consists of $36 to $42 million of sustaining and $12 to $14 million of non-sustaining capital. The majority of the capital is expected to be spent at Fire Creek as the Company continues underground expansion in the form of primary access development. Total exploration expense is planned to be $10 to $12 million and is expected to be spent on district and near mine exploration.\nBelow are tables summarizing key 2018 operating guidance:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gold Equivalent Ounces Produced(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Production Cash Costs per Gold Equivalent Ounce Sold(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capital Expenditures (thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 full year outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midas Mill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fire Creek\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hollister\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aurora\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nevada Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>True North\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative (thousands)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) This is a non-GAAP measure; refer to the Non-GAAP Performance Measures section of the MD&A for additional detail.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Includes share based compensation of approximately $4 million, a non-cash item.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have not reconciled forward-looking 2018 full year non-GAAP performance measures contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliations would require unreasonable efforts at this time to estimate and quantify, with a reasonable degree of certainty, various necessary GAAP components, including for example those related to future production costs, realized sales prices and the timing of such sales, timing and amounts of capital expenditures, metal recoveries, and corporate general and administrative amounts and timing, or others that\nmay arise during the year. These components and other factors could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures, which may differ significantly from their non-GAAP counterparts.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThis MD&A is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. The preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that are considered to be relevant at the time our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ, and such differences could be material.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires significant management judgments and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact our financial statements. Although other estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. For information on all of our significant accounting policies and additional estimates, see Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies and Note 3. Recent accounting pronouncements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet realizable value of production-related inventories\nEstimate required: Our production-related inventories include stockpiles, in-process, and dor\u00e9 finished goods, all of which are measured and carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated future sales price of production-related inventories in the ordinary course of business using period-end metal prices less the estimated costs to convert the inventories into a saleable product (less estimated selling costs). A change in metal price levels or estimated future costs of completion from those which were used in our year-end net realizable value calculations could result in, or contribute to, additional future write-downs of production-related inventories.\nImpact of change in estimate: We incorporated year-end metal prices for gold and silver of $1,297 and $16.87 per ounce, respectively, into our net realizable value calculations. At Midas, Hollister, and True North, lower metal prices and/or increases in estimated costs to complete would have a corresponding increase on the amount of write-downs recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Fire Creek did not have write downs and the estimated net realizable value of production-related inventories exceeded its cost by approximately 130%.\nAs discussed in Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the application of our lower of average cost or net realizable value accounting policy resulted in write-downs of production inventories at Midas and True North.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nEstimate required: Our long-lived assets, which consist of mineral properties, plant and equipment, are evaluated for recoverability annually and at interim periods as needed. A recoverability test is performed if triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events that may trigger a test for recoverability include significant adverse changes to projected revenues, increases in costs and capital expenditures, or future plans that may adversely impact our current or future operations and cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. Existing proven and probable reserves, value beyond proven and probable reserves, and mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included in estimates of future cash flows. An impairment is determined to exist if the total projected future cash flows on an undiscounted pretax basis are less than the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. An impairment loss is measured using discounted cash flows and recorded based on the excess carrying value of the impaired long-lived asset over its estimated fair value. The assumptions, projections, and probabilities used to determine estimates of future cash flows are consistent or reasonable in relation to internal budgets, projections, and life-of-mine plans. Any change in the assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in our impairment calculations could materially impact our financial statements.\nImpact of change in estimate: The most significant assumptions used in our 2017 impairment tests include estimates of future gold and silver ounces sold and long-term future average gold and silver selling prices. As of December 31, 2017, our projected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using average long-term gold and silver prices of $1,303 and $19.31 per ounce, respectively, exceeded the carrying values of the related long-lived asset groups by approximately 832% for Fire Creek, 132% for Midas, 213% for True North, and 222% for Hollister.\nWe did not experience any impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nBusiness combinations\nEstimate required: When accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase consideration transferred to the estimated fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities assumed, as well as the consideration transferred, requires us to make estimates about future cash flows from long-lived assets, valuation of deferred taxes, and asset retirement obligations using models and inputs, as of the acquisition date, which are comparable to our long-lived asset impairment analysis and estimates relating to valuation of common shares and warrants. Any change in the assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in our fair value calculations could materially impact our financial statements, including during a measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date.\nImpact of change in estimate: If we were to change inputs, assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in business combinations that determine the fair values of consideration transferred, assets acquired, or liabilities assumed, the amounts recorded in our financial statements could change.\nAs discussed in Note 4. Business combinations to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we completed two acquisitions over the last three years which were accounted for as business combinations.\nIncome taxes\nEstimate required: Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the United States and Canada. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecast operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies. Changes in valuation allowances are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined.\nImpact of change in estimate: As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded deferred tax assets of $1.1 million (net of a valuation allowance of $58.7 million for deferred tax assets). Our estimate of future taxable earnings is the most significant estimate that impacts deferred taxes, and if such estimate was changed, would result in a corresponding increase or decrease to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nSee Note 15.

During our mining activities, we may encounter mineralization not included in the mineral reserve estimate that, in the opinion of management, can be processed economically. Often-times, rather than leaving such mineralized ore for future extraction, we mine the area when encountered so as not to potentially sterilize or incur additional costs to re-access and mine the ore at a later date. In other instances, additional design work, rehabilitation, and/or underground development may be required to enable access to mineralization included in the mineral resource estimate. Due to the above, actual mined gold and gold equivalent grades can differ from those which are stated in the current mineral reserve estimate.\nConsolidated\nThe following table provides a summary of consolidated operating results for our producing properties which include our Nevada operations, Fire Creek, Midas, and Hollister (which began mining activities during the end of the first quarter of 2017), and our Canadian asset, True North, which was placed into production during the end of the third quarter of 2016.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Nevada operations produced 161,536 GEOs, an increase of 7% from 151,007 GEOs produced during 2016. Core operations at Fire Creek and Midas performed in line with expectations. Total GEOs produced were less than the lower end of the most recent guidance range primarily due to results from Hollister, which produced 7,371 GEOs compared to the low end of the guidance range of 21,000 GEOs. The Company deferred the processing of a majority of the mined Hollister ore as it continued to optimize recoveries at the Midas mill for this ore. The majority of stockpiles at the end of 2017 were from Hollister. Modifications to the Midas mill are underway and recoveries for the Hollister ore are approximately 80% with additional improvements expected.\nCanadian operations\nDuring 2017, at True North, we milled 216,978 ore tons, from mining operations, at an average milled head grade of 0.12 gold ounces per ton, producing 24,636 GEOs. We also processed 80,848 tons from the True North Tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton, producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces. Total production for the year was 27,919 GEOs, approximately 7,000 GEOs short of the low end of the revised guidance. This shortfall was due to mining lower than forecasted grades from True North. The lower\nmined grades are attributed to delays in waste development which postponed mining planned stopes in the 711/713 areas of the True North mine, excessive dilution from a hanging wall failure and negative model grade reconciliation.\nSubsequent to the reporting period, on January 9, 2018, we announced that following an extensive review of the operational performance at True North, management decided to place the mine under care and maintenance to review strategic options and to provide optionality at higher metal prices. This decision was largely based on the site's inability to achieve planned operating and cash flow targets in 2017 and to refocus our resources on our Nevada assets. We will continue to process tailings through the mill for the near future in order to maximize cash flow and offset expected care and maintenance costs.\nAll-in sustaining costs\nTotal Company all in sustaining costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,149 per gold ounce sold. For 2018, the Company expects to have all in sustaining costs for the year of $940 to $990 per gold ounce sold.

For the year, 123,754 tons were mined at a grade of 0.90 GEOs per ton. Fire Creek was able to increase production year-over-year due to increased ore tonnage mined and milled with consistently high grades. Over the past three years we have focused on completing the required development and drilling to responsibly increase Fire Creek's annual production through increased tonnage as it has the lowest cost structure in our portfolio due to its high grades. We have been able to increase and sustain the mining rate through additions in underground mining equipment and employees. Due largely to the grades at Fire Creek, we have been able to maintain a $479 production cash costs per GEO structure, which was slightly above the high end of our annual expectation of $450.\nSpending - 2017 spending was $26.0 million for capital and $2.8 million for exploration. Capital expenditures were slightly lower than annual expectation of $27 - 29 million.

For the year, 156,927 tons were mined at a grade of 0.33 GEOs per ton. Gold equivalent mill head grades increased 14.3% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to mining higher grade areas. Average mill head grades remained consistent to the mill head grades in 2015. We experience cost and recovery rate synergies from processing ore from Fire Creek and Hollister at Midas; however, during 2017, 2016 and 2015, production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization per GEO exceeded the price of gold and were subject to write downs. Mineral properties and depletion are amortized on a reserve gold equivalent ounces. (see Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nSpending - 2017 spending was $16.3 million for capital for both Midas mine and the Midas mill and came in line with our annual expectation of $15 - 18 million. For details of capital expenditures and the classification between sustaining and non-sustaining (growth) refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nMidas Mill (Nevada Operations)\nOre from Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister are processed at the Midas mill, which has a design capacity of 1,200 tons per day. Run-of-mine ore is crushed to 100% passing 1/2\" in a conventional two-stage crushing circuit which utilizes a primary jaw crusher and a secondary cone crusher with the circuit closed by a double deck vibrating screen. During 2017 the Company began to process Hollister ore at the Midas mill. The company converted four of the mill's leach tanks to carbon in leach (\"CIL\") to allow Hollister ore to be processed. The commissioning of the new CIL circuit is in process while the Company tests ore blends from the Nevada mines to yield the most favorable results. The Company is in a favorable position to now have three mines in Northern Nevada feeding one central mill, providing significant operating flexibility to optimize profitability.\nThe Company also added a tails thickener to the Midas mill. The addition of the thickener will extend the life of the tailings facilities and reduce future capital expenditures for tailing facilities following the completion of the 2018 expansion. The Company anticipates $16 to $18 million of capital to be spent in 2018 on the expansion of the tailings facility at the Midas mill.\nHollister (Nevada Operations)\nThe Hollister mine is a fully-permitted past producing underground and open pit operation, located in north-central Nevada in Elko County. Hollister does not have milling or processing facilities but is located approximately 17 miles away from the Midas mill, which currently has capacity to process additional tons. Hollister is an important asset to us since we believe there are significant synergies and cost savings with our Nevada operations through low transportation costs, reduced per ton milling costs, and shared general and administrative costs. Further, certain of our executives and management previously operated the historical underground operations and exploration programs at Hollister and believe that exploration targets with significant potential exist within the property boundary. We believe Hollister provides us with an opportunity to strategically and responsibly grow our business in Nevada, a mining friendly jurisdiction, while leveraging our technical expertise in narrow-vein underground mining and past experience with the project.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mine Operations - Hollister\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ore tons mined\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold equivalent mined head grade (oz/ton)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent mined (oz)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold mined (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver mined (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ore tons milled\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold equivalent mill head grade (oz/ton)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold mill head grade (oz/ton)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average silver mill head grade (oz/ton)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gold recovery rate (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average silver recovery rate (%)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent produced (oz)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold produced (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver produced (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent sold (oz)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold sold (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver sold (oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and realized prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold revenue (000s)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver revenue (000s)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues (000s)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized gold price ($/oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized silver price ($/oz)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP Measures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production cash costs per GEO sold(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Gold equivalent measures are the gold measure plus the silver measure divided by a GEO ratio.

For the quarter, Hollister mined 20,440 tons at a grade of 0.44 GEOs per ton. For the year, Hollister mined 66,453 tons at a grade of 0.38 GEOs per ton. In 2017, recovered GEOs were 7,371. Sold GEOs for the year totaled 5,281 GEOs. Stockpiles at the end of 2017 contained approximately 15,000 GEOs from 44,000 tons at a GEO grade of 0.40 ounces per ton.\nMetallurgical test work is being performed to identify processing improvements to increase the gold and silver recoveries of the Hollister ore processed through the Midas mill. The recent mill modification, eliminating all cyanide in the grinding circuit, planned for the fourth quarter was not finished until the first week of January 2018. As a result, the decision was made to stockpile the Hollister ore during the fourth quarter in order to limit the risk of lower mill recoveries and less revenue. In 2018, the Company has already milled approximately 15,000 tons of Hollister ore at estimated gold and silver grades of 0.48 and 3.20 ounces per ton, respectively. Gold and silver recoveries for that material are estimated at approximately 80% and 60%, respectively. Ongoing metallurgical test work supports that gold recoveries of 85-90% can be achieved with additional modifications to the Midas mill circuit, including increasing leach time and finer grinding. Design and engineering of these modifications are being evaluated but are expected to be achievable with minimal capital investments.\nSpending - During the year ended December 31, 2017 total capital spending was $6.7 million and development and project costs totaled $10.6 million. For details of capital expenditures refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nCommunity - On August 17, 2017, the Company completed the donation of the Rock Creek lands, (more than 3,200 acres of lands), to the Battle Mountain Band of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada.\nAurora updates\nAurora project overview\nThe Aurora project is a fully-permitted past producing underground and open pit operation, located in west-central Nevada in Mineral County. Aurora has a 350 ton per day milling and processing facility, which provides us an opportunity to reprocess tailings from an existing tailing facility on the property and to consider toll milling services.

We also processed 80,848 tons from the True North tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton, producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces.\nAfter the Company performed an extensive review of the operational performance at True North and the 2018 objectives of the Company as a whole, management decided to place the mine under care and maintenance to review strategic options and to provide optionality at higher metal prices. This decision was largely based on the site's inability to achieve planned operating and cash flow targets in 2017 and to refocus the Company's resources on Nevada assets. The Company will continue to process tailings through the mill for the near future in order to maximize cash flow and offset expected care and maintenance costs.\nThe Company recognized write-downs to production inventories of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nSpending - For the year ended December 31, 2017, spending was $14.5 million for capital and $0.2 million for exploration. For details of capital expenditures refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nFinancial position, liquidity, and capital resources\nGeneral strategy\nTo maintain sufficient liquid assets and access to capital resources, we regularly perform short and long-term cash flow forecasts using current assumptions of future gold and silver prices, foreign exchange rates, production volumes, and operating, exploration, development and capital costs. Our liquidity and capital resources management strategy entails a disciplined approach by monitoring the timing and amount of any investment in our mines, projects, or exploration properties, while continually remaining in a position which we believe will allow us to respond to changes in our business environment, such as a decrease in metal prices, or other factors beyond our control.\nOur capital structure consists of a mixture of debt and shareholders' equity. We regularly review our capital structure and evaluate various financing options and strategies that: (1) may improve our current liquidity and financial condition, (2) are attainable on favorable and reasonable terms, and (3) are permissible under our existing debt arrangements and other obligations. Such financing options may include, but are not limited to, additional or increases in revolving borrowing facilities, equipment financing, term loan facilities, refinancing existing obligations, and/or the issuance of equity securities, warrants, or other instruments.\nRisk management contracts\nIn order to increase the certainty of expected future cash flows, from time to time we may enter into financial instruments for a portion of our forecast gold and silver sales over the next one to twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into forward trades which covered 171,036 and 1,084,896 gold and silver ounces at average prices of $1,261 and $17.24, respectively. Additionally, we entered into various short-term zero cost gold collars during the year. The collars ranged in floor and ceiling prices and in quantity of ounces. As of December 31, 2017, all gold forward trades and collars had either expired, were sold, or were executed and we did not have any outstanding (see Note 11. Derivatives to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail). Other than the aforementioned, we have not entered into any other significant contracts to hedge or manage market risks arising from changes in metal prices, diesel and propane costs, and currency and interest rates. We will continually and actively monitor applicable markets and quotes and may consider entering into additional hedging agreements and contracts if determined to be advantageous by management and the Board, and if such transactions are permissible under our existing debt agreements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs discussed below in the Sources and uses of cash section, at December 31, 2017, our Cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $23.7 million, decreasing $24.0 million from the December 31, 2016 balance of $47.6 million largely due to investing cash outflows of $66.4 million primarily related to capital expenditures, which were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $26.4 million and cash provided by financing activities of $15.7 million.\nDue to the nature of our operations and the composition of our balance sheet assets, as of December 31, 2017, our current assets, which included Cash and cash equivalents of $23.7 million and Inventories of $42.6 million, represented substantially all of our liquid assets on hand. We have access to additional liquidity under our $40.0 million Revolver, of which $5.0 million was available as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $37.4 million. The following chart provides a summary of our working capital, Revolver availability, and estimated liquidity for the last three years (in thousands):\nOur working capital increased by $4.2 million (approximately 12.57%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and our working capital ratio increased to 2.02. The following table summarizes working capital (in thousands, except working capital ratio):\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Current assets divided by current liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking capital changes related to the decrease in total current assets were primarily attributable to a $24.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents (discussed below in the Sources and uses of cash section), offset by a $21.3 million increase in inventory primarily as a result of Hollister operations stockpiling ore during its ramp up throughout the year ended December 31, 2017. Working capital changes related to the decrease in total current liabilities were primarily attributable to a decrease in current debt as a result of the repayment of the Gold Purchase Agreement during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncluded in working capital are Inventories, which include production-related inventories that can provide us with additional cash liquidity in excess of their December 31, 2017 carrying value of $33.3 million due to a cash margin we expect to realize at the time of sale. The following table summarizes the estimated recoverable gold and silver ounces contained in our Inventories and the underlying amount of revenue which may be generated from their sale using December 31, 2017 period-end prices, which would be further reduced for any remaining processing and refining costs (in thousands, except ounces and period-end prices):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Silver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated ounces in Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period-end prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur December 31, 2017 working capital, available sources of liquidity, and future operating cash flows will be used, in part, to fund recurring operating and production costs, make principal and interest payments on debt, and to fund capital expenditures and exploration and development costs at our mines and projects. At current gold and silver price levels, and when using our estimates of future production and costs, we believe our cash flows from operating activities together with our working capital and Revolver, will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next 12 months.

Generally speaking, when the US dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, we experience negative foreign currency translation adjustments on our Canadian dollar cash balances (the opposite is true when the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar). Changes in exchange rates resulted in an increase to our cash balance of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreases to our cash balances of $1.6 million and $3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table provides a listing of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Revolver(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Amounts reflect the repayment of principal drawn and related cash interest on the Revolver through its current maturity date of December 31, 2019.

In addition to the above, our mines and projects are subject to certain royalty commitments as disclosed in Note 21. Commitments and contingencies.\nDebt covenants\nOur debt agreements contain certain representations and warranties, restrictions, events of default, and covenants, customary for agreements of these types. Additionally, the Revolver contains financial covenants which require us to maintain a Tangible Net Worth not less than $100.0 million, a Gearing Ratio (a measure of debt to EBITDA) not greater than 4.00:1, a Cash Balance not less than $10.0 million, and a Current Ratio not less than 1.10:1 (as such terms are defined in the Revolver). The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nOutstanding share capital\nAs of March 9, 2018, there were 179,614,947 common shares, 4,033,138 options, 10,001,242 warrants, 1,390,342 RSUs, 507,633 PSUs outstanding, and 195,547,302 common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNon-GAAP performance measures\nWe have included the non-GAAP measures \"Cash revenue from operations\", \"Cash production costs from operations\", \"Cash margin from operations\", \"Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\", \"All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\" and \"All-in costs per gold ounce sold\" in this MD&A (collectively, the \"Non-GAAP Measures\"). These Non-GAAP Measures are used internally to assess our operating and economic performance and to provide key performance information to management. We believe that these Non-GAAP Measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flows required to fund and sustain our business. These Non-GAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These Non-GAAP Measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP, and therefore may not be comparable to or consistent with measures used by other issuers or with amounts presented in our financial statements.\nOur primary business is gold production and our current and future operations, development, exploration, and life-of-mine plans primarily focus on maximizing returns from such gold production. As a result, our Non-GAAP Measures are calculated and disclosed on a per gold or gold equivalent ounce basis.\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold presents our cash costs associated with the production of gold equivalent ounces and, as such, non-cash depreciation and depletion charges are excluded. Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis, and includes all direct and indirect operating costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (State of Nevada net proceeds and other such taxes are excluded). We believe that converting the benefits from selling silver ounces into gold ounces is helpful to analysts and investors as it best represents the way we operate, which is to maximize returns from gold production. Gold equivalent ounces are computed using the number of silver ounces required to generate the revenue derived from the sale of one gold ounce, using average realized selling prices (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nevada Total(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>True North\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nevada Total(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>True North\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nevada Total(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized price per gold ounce sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized price per silver ounce sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver ounces equivalent to revenue from one gold ounce\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver ounces sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>984,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,708,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GEOs from silver ounces sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold ounces sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gold equivalent ounces\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Write-down of production inventories (cash portion) (see Note 5 -

The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.\nOur calculation of AISC per gold ounce sold is consistent with the June 2013 guidance released by the World Gold Council, a non-regulatory, non-profit market development organization for the gold industry. AISC per gold ounce sold reflects the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project, including costs required to discover and develop new sources of production; therefore, capital amounts related to expansion and growth projects are included.\nAISC per gold ounce sold includes all: (1) direct and indirect operating cash costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) asset retirement and accretion expenses, and (4) sustaining capital expenditures, the total of which is reduced for revenues earned from silver sales. Certain cash expenditures, including State of Nevada net proceeds and other related taxes, federal tax payments, and financing costs are excluded.\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold includes additional costs which reflect the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project. We calculate our all-in costs per gold ounce sold by beginning with the AISC total and adding non-sustaining (growth) capital expenditures and exploration and development expenditures.\nTable 164:

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") contains forward-looking statements (as previously defined) which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as more fully described in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&A provides a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and includes the Company's subsidiaries. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our other reports filed with the SEC as well as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion has been prepared based on information available to us as of March 14, 2018. All dollar amounts included in this MD&A are expressed in thousands of United States dollars unless otherwise noted. References to CDN$ refer to Canadian dollars. References to \"Notes\" refer to the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn this MD&A, we use the non-GAAP performance measures \"Cash revenue from operations\", \"Cash production costs from operations\", \"Cash margin from operations\", \"Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\", \"All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\" and \"All-in costs per gold ounce sold\", which should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the Non-GAAP performance measures section of this MD&A for additional detail.\nOverview\nOur discussion and analysis consists of the following subsections:\n \u2022 Introduction and strategy which provides a brief discussion of our current operations and business strategies and goals; \n \u2022 Executive summary which lists significant matters related to 2017; \n \u2022 2018 full year outlook which summarizes our estimates for 2018 production volumes, costs, and capital, development, and exploration spending; \n \u2022 Critical accounting estimates which provides a discussion of accounting estimates that we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because they affect reported amounts and require significant management judgment and assumptions about highly uncertain matters; \n \u2022 Results of operations which provides a discussion and analysis of our operating results for the last three years; \n \u2022 Mining operations review which provides a discussion of our mine operations and production statistics for the last three years. \n \u2022 Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources which provides a discussion of our cash flows (last three years), liquidity, available sources of liquidity, capital requirements, and debt covenants; and \n \u2022 Non-GAAP performance measures which includes a description of our three non-GAAP financial measures: production cash costs per GEO sold, all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold, and all-in costs per gold ounce sold, the reasons for our use of such measures, and a three year reconciliation to our nearest GAAP measures.  Introduction and strategy\nWe are a junior-tier gold and silver mining company focused on exploration, development, and production in a safe, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective manner. As of December 31, 2017, we had 100% interests in four producing mines: (1) Fire Creek (2) Midas mine and ore milling facility and (3) Hollister, all of which are located in the state of Nevada, USA, and (4) True North gold mine and mill located in Manitoba, Canada (\"True North\"). We also have a 100% interest in the Aurora mine and ore milling facility (\"Aurora\"), which is also located in Nevada, USA and a 100% interest in the Ogama-Rockland gold exploration property located in Manitoba, Canada. All of our mines are located in safe political jurisdictions.\nPrior to February 2014, our only mine was Fire Creek, and since that time, we have experienced growth in our annual gold and silver production, total assets, and workforce largely due to growth at Fire Creek and to the acquisitions of Midas (February 2014), True North (January 2016), and Hollister and Aurora (October 2016).\nGold and silver sales represent 100% of our revenues and the market prices of gold and silver significantly impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. Our primary strategy is to increase shareholder value by responsibly achieving our production, cost, and capital targets while attempting to extend our mine lives through development and exploration programs and reducing our costs through operational efficiencies. We also consider acquisitions or other arrangements in the normal course which strategically fit our future growth objectives.\nExecutive summary\nOur 2017 highlights included the following, which are discussed in further detail throughout this MD&A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n \u2022 Health, safety, and environmental - We remained committed to our most important core values by operating in an environmentally responsible manner while protecting the health and safety of our employees and contractors. As of December 31, 2017, we had operated 1,903 days (~5.2 years) at Fire Creek, 1,182 days (~3.2 years) at Midas, 53 days (~0.1 years) at True North, and 454 days (~1.2 years) at Hollister and Aurora, without a lost-time injury. During 2017, we had one lost-time injury at True North. Prior to this, True North had operated for nearly two years without a lost-time injury. \n \u2022 Consolidated performance - We mined a total of 222,233 GEOs. Mined ounces are calculated using tons hauled from underground to surface (or tons hauled from tailings) multiplied by the assays from production sampling. We produced a total of 189,456 GEO's, an increase of 17% from 161,289 GEOs produced during 2016. \n \u2022 Nevada performance - At Fire Creek, Midas, and Hollister, we mined 356,697 ore tons during the year at an average mined head grade of 0.53 GEOs per ton. Nevada operations mined 190,409 GEOs. Production cash costs per GEO sold in Nevada was $692. The Company began processing Hollister ore at the Midas mill at the end of the third quarter with process optimization ongoing. \n \u2022 Fire Creek - We mined 123,754 ore tons from Fire Creek in the year at an average mined head grade of 0.90 GEO per ton, producing 108,126 GEOs, in-line with guidance for the year. \n \u2022 Midas - The Midas mine also performed in-line with guidance for the year. For the year, we mined 156,927 ore tons at an average mined head grade of 0.33 GEO per ton. Produced ounces for the year were 45,062 GEOs. \n \u2022 Hollister - The Hollister mine development continued to increase in the fourth quarter, mining over 9,000 GEOs. For the year, Hollister mined 66,453 tons at a grade of 0.38 GEOs per ton containing 25,464 GEOs. Produced ounces for the year was 7,371 GEOs. Stockpiles at the end of 2017 contained approximately 15,000 GEOs from 44,000 tons at a GEO grade of 0.40 ounces per ton. \n \u2022 True North - At True North in Canada, we mined 228,495 ore tons from mining operations at an average mine head grade of 0.12 gold ounces per ton (3.73 grams per tonne) producing 24,636 GEOs. We also milled 80,848 tons from the True North tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton (1.24 grams per tonne) producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces. This production was approximately 7,000 GEOs short of the low end of the revised guidance for the year. This shortfall was due to mining lower than forecasted grades. \n \u2022 Ounces sold and financial results - We sold 190,865 GEOs, consisting of 177,402 gold ounces and 984,176 silver ounces. Revenue was $240.7 million from average realized selling prices per gold and silver ounce of $1,261 and $17.26, respectively. Net loss was $23.7 million ($0.13 loss per share - basic and diluted). \n \u2022 Cash flows and liquidity - Our ending cash balance was $23.7 million after $26.4 million of operating cash flows, $66.4 million used in investing activities, and $15.7 million provided by financing activities. Ending working capital was $37.4 million and total liquidity was $42.4 million when including the $5.0 million of Revolver availability. \n \u2022 Spending - Capital, exploration, and development spending totaled $28.7 million at Fire Creek, $16.7 million at Midas including the Midas mill, $22.1 million at Hollister, $2.7 million at Aurora, $14.7 million at True North, and $0.6 million at corporate for total capital, exploration and development spending of $85.6 million. \n \u2022 Acquisition - On October 19, 2017, the Company completed its arrangement with Bison Gold Resources Inc. (\"Bison Gold\"), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the common shares of Bison Gold. Under the terms of the Arrangement, each former Bison Gold shareholder received 0.1242 of a common share of Klondex for each Bison Gold common share held prior to the arrangement. The Company issued a total of 1,956,126 shares. \n2018 full year outlook\nThe following statements are based on our current expectations for fiscal year 2018 results. The statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.\nWe expect to produce between 186,000 and 202,000 GEOs during 2018 at an expected production cash cost per GEO sold of $675 to $725. Total production is not expected to be equally distributed by quarter during the year as higher levels of production are expected during the second and third quarters due to the processing of tailings. It is anticipated that production could vary 5,000 to 10,000 GEOs between the highest and lowest producing quarters. Production from the Fire Creek and Midas mines are expected to be consistent with 2017. Hollister mine production is expected to increase during the year as the benefit of processing the stock pile from 2017 is realized. In addition, Klondex has begun processing historical Hollister tailings at the Aurora mill and expects to realize incremental production from that operation during 2018. Production from the True North mine in Canada will decrease as mining operations have been suspended and most of the GEOs produced will come from the processing of tailings. Total all-in sustaining costs (AISC) are projected to be between $940 and $990 per gold ounce sold for 2018.\nWe expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be between $48 to $56 million, including $16 to $18 million of capital to be spent on the construction of a new tailings facility for the Midas mill. Total capital expenditures guidance consists of $36 to $42 million of sustaining and $12 to $14 million of non-sustaining capital. The majority of the capital is expected to be spent at Fire Creek as the Company continues underground expansion in the form of primary access development. Total exploration expense is planned to be $10 to $12 million and is expected to be spent on district and near mine exploration.\nBelow are tables summarizing key 2018 operating guidance:\n\nWe have not reconciled forward-looking 2018 full year non-GAAP performance measures contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliations would require unreasonable efforts at this time to estimate and quantify, with a reasonable degree of certainty, various necessary GAAP components, including for example those related to future production costs, realized sales prices and the timing of such sales, timing and amounts of capital expenditures, metal recoveries, and corporate general and administrative amounts and timing, or others that\nmay arise during the year. These components and other factors could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures, which may differ significantly from their non-GAAP counterparts.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThis MD&A is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. The preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that are considered to be relevant at the time our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ, and such differences could be material.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires significant management judgments and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact our financial statements. Although other estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. For information on all of our significant accounting policies and additional estimates, see Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies and Note 3. Recent accounting pronouncements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet realizable value of production-related inventories\nEstimate required: Our production-related inventories include stockpiles, in-process, and dor\u00e9 finished goods, all of which are measured and carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated future sales price of production-related inventories in the ordinary course of business using period-end metal prices less the estimated costs to convert the inventories into a saleable product (less estimated selling costs). A change in metal price levels or estimated future costs of completion from those which were used in our year-end net realizable value calculations could result in, or contribute to, additional future write-downs of production-related inventories.\nImpact of change in estimate: We incorporated year-end metal prices for gold and silver of $1,297 and $16.87 per ounce, respectively, into our net realizable value calculations. At Midas, Hollister, and True North, lower metal prices and/or increases in estimated costs to complete would have a corresponding increase on the amount of write-downs recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Fire Creek did not have write downs and the estimated net realizable value of production-related inventories exceeded its cost by approximately 130%.\nAs discussed in Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the application of our lower of average cost or net realizable value accounting policy resulted in write-downs of production inventories at Midas and True North.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nEstimate required: Our long-lived assets, which consist of mineral properties, plant and equipment, are evaluated for recoverability annually and at interim periods as needed. A recoverability test is performed if triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events that may trigger a test for recoverability include significant adverse changes to projected revenues, increases in costs and capital expenditures, or future plans that may adversely impact our current or future operations and cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. Existing proven and probable reserves, value beyond proven and probable reserves, and mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included in estimates of future cash flows. An impairment is determined to exist if the total projected future cash flows on an undiscounted pretax basis are less than the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. An impairment loss is measured using discounted cash flows and recorded based on the excess carrying value of the impaired long-lived asset over its estimated fair value. The assumptions, projections, and probabilities used to determine estimates of future cash flows are consistent or reasonable in relation to internal budgets, projections, and life-of-mine plans. Any change in the assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in our impairment calculations could materially impact our financial statements.\nImpact of change in estimate: The most significant assumptions used in our 2017 impairment tests include estimates of future gold and silver ounces sold and long-term future average gold and silver selling prices. As of December 31, 2017, our projected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using average long-term gold and silver prices of $1,303 and $19.31 per ounce, respectively, exceeded the carrying values of the related long-lived asset groups by approximately 832% for Fire Creek, 132% for Midas, 213% for True North, and 222% for Hollister.\nWe did not experience any impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nBusiness combinations\nEstimate required: When accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase consideration transferred to the estimated fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities assumed, as well as the consideration transferred, requires us to make estimates about future cash flows from long-lived assets, valuation of deferred taxes, and asset retirement obligations using models and inputs, as of the acquisition date, which are comparable to our long-lived asset impairment analysis and estimates relating to valuation of common shares and warrants. Any change in the assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in our fair value calculations could materially impact our financial statements, including during a measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date.\nImpact of change in estimate: If we were to change inputs, assumptions, projections, or probabilities used in business combinations that determine the fair values of consideration transferred, assets acquired, or liabilities assumed, the amounts recorded in our financial statements could change.\nAs discussed in Note 4. Business combinations to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we completed two acquisitions over the last three years which were accounted for as business combinations.\nIncome taxes\nEstimate required: Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the United States and Canada. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecast operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies. Changes in valuation allowances are reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined.\nImpact of change in estimate: As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded deferred tax assets of $1.1 million (net of a valuation allowance of $58.7 million for deferred tax assets). Our estimate of future taxable earnings is the most significant estimate that impacts deferred taxes, and if such estimate was changed, would result in a corresponding increase or decrease to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nSee Note 15. Income taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nResults of operations\n\nRevenues increased from 2015 to 2017 due to increases in the number of gold ounces sold from higher tons mined at Fire Creek and Midas, and due to higher grades at Midas, and due to production commencing at True North at the end of 2016 and during 2017 for Hollister. These volumes were also impacted by changes in average realized prices. Consolidated ore tons milled during 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 627,774, 407,245, and 261,288, respectively. See the Mining operations review section of this MD&A for additional discussion on our operating results at each mine.\nGold revenue - The table below summarizes changes in gold revenue, ounces sold, and average realized prices (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\n\nGold revenues increased during 2017 and 2016 largely due to increases of 38,886 ounces and 28,458 ounces, respectively, from the preceding year due to increased ore tonnage mined and milled. During 2017 and 2016, gold revenues further benefited from an increase of $16 (or 1.3%) and $89 (or 7.7%) in the average realized price per ounce sold, respectively.\nSilver revenue - The table below summarizes changes in silver revenue, ounces sold, and average realized prices (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\n\nSilver revenues decreased during 2017 as we sold 486,816 less ounces than 2016 at an average realized price per ounce that was $0.18 (or 1.0%) lower than prior year. Silver revenues also decreased year-over-year in 2016, as we sold 237,556 less ounces than in 2015 but the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.72 (or 10.9%) in the average realized price per ounce sold. Silver revenues were also affected by production in higher gold and less silver concentrated areas of the mine.\n\nProduction costs - For the reasons discussed in the above Revenues section, higher ounce sales largely contributed to increased production costs in 2017 and 2016 compared to their respective previous years with additional impacts from average mill head grades. See the Mining operations review section of this MD&A for a discussion of production costs at each mine.\nDepreciation and depletion - Depreciation and depletion increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to changes in volume of GEOs sold at Fire Creek, Midas, Hollister and True North.\nWrite-down of production inventories - Increases in production costs and depletion and depreciation led to write-downs of ending inventory balances at Midas, Hollister, and True North for the year ended December 31, 2017, at Midas and True North in 2016, and Midas in 2015. See Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nThe increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015 is due to higher compensation and benefit costs from increased staff levels at the corporate office and professional fees, both of which are due to our growth.\n\nExploration expenditures are generally determined by our discretionary plans to completed drilling campaigns at our various properties and targets. Exploration expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.8 million at Fire Creek, $4.8 million at Hollister, $0.5 million at Midas, and $0.2 million at True North. Exploration expenditures during 2016 and 2015 at Fire Creek were $8.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and at Midas were $4.0 million and $6.6 million, respectively.\n\nDevelopment and project costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $10.6 million at Hollister and $1.1 million at Aurora. These costs were generally for rehabilitating drifts and ramps which enable us to physically access the underground stopes and working faces, drilling, engineering, metallurgical, and other related costs to delineate or expand mineralization. Development and project costs during 2016 were $3.4 million at Hollister and $5.5 million at True North.\n\nThese amounts relate to the accretion expense from existing asset retirement obligations and changes to our expected asset retirement costs at our mining and exploration properties. See Note 9. Asset retirement obligations to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nThese amounts relate to costs and expenses associated with the acquisitions of True North (January 2016), and Hollister and Aurora (October 2016).\n\nAmounts recorded for derivatives are attributable to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and gains or losses on derivative settlements and transactions, both of which are generally impacted by changes in gold and silver prices. See Note 11. Derivatives to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAmounts recorded as interest expense have generally decreased over the past three years as our existing debt continues to amortize resulting in increases to amounts applied to principal balances. In all years, the largest component of total interest expense was for the February 2014 Gold Purchase Agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation, which represented 63.6%, 74.7%, and 66.9% of recorded interest expense during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. See Note 8. Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAmounts recorded for foreign currency losses primarily relate to unrealized amounts on intercompany loan balances which we expect to settle in the foreseeable future which were partially offset by gains on U.S. dollar debt held in our Canadian companies.\n\nWe recorded losses on debt extinguishment for the 2017 repayment of the Gold Purchase Agreement, the 2016 repayment of the $12.0 million promissory note to the vendor we acquired True North from and for the 2015 repayment of the CDN$25.0 million 11.0% senior secured notes due August 11, 2017. See Note 8. Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nSee Note 15. Income taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of taxes.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above and elsewhere in this MD&A, we reported the above amounts for Net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Net income was negatively impacted by $8.9 million for income tax expense related to the changes in United States federal tax laws.\nMining operations review\nActual vs. modeled resource grades\nOur average gold and gold equivalent mill head grades, on both a consolidated and individual mine site basis, can vary from the average grades of the mineral reserve estimates for each site. During our mining activities, we may encounter mineralization not included in the mineral reserve estimate that, in the opinion of management, can be processed economically. Often-times, rather than leaving such mineralized ore for future extraction, we mine the area when encountered so as not to potentially sterilize or incur additional costs to re-access and mine the ore at a later date. In other instances, additional design work, rehabilitation, and/or underground development may be required to enable access to mineralization included in the mineral resource estimate. Due to the above, actual mined gold and gold equivalent grades can differ from those which are stated in the current mineral reserve estimate.\nConsolidated\nThe following table provides a summary of consolidated operating results for our producing properties which include our Nevada operations, Fire Creek, Midas, and Hollister (which began mining activities during the end of the first quarter of 2017), and our Canadian asset, True North, which was placed into production during the end of the third quarter of 2016.\n\nNevada operations\nDuring 2017, the Company's Nevada operations milled 329,948 ore tons at an average milled head grade of 0.55 GEOs per ton. Nevada operations produced 161,536 GEOs, an increase of 7% from 151,007 GEOs produced during 2016. Core operations at Fire Creek and Midas performed in line with expectations. Total GEOs produced were less than the lower end of the most recent guidance range primarily due to results from Hollister, which produced 7,371 GEOs compared to the low end of the guidance range of 21,000 GEOs. The Company deferred the processing of a majority of the mined Hollister ore as it continued to optimize recoveries at the Midas mill for this ore. The majority of stockpiles at the end of 2017 were from Hollister. Modifications to the Midas mill are underway and recoveries for the Hollister ore are approximately 80% with additional improvements expected.\nCanadian operations\nDuring 2017, at True North, we milled 216,978 ore tons, from mining operations, at an average milled head grade of 0.12 gold ounces per ton, producing 24,636 GEOs. We also processed 80,848 tons from the True North Tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton, producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces. Total production for the year was 27,919 GEOs, approximately 7,000 GEOs short of the low end of the revised guidance. This shortfall was due to mining lower than forecasted grades from True North. The lower\nmined grades are attributed to delays in waste development which postponed mining planned stopes in the 711/713 areas of the True North mine, excessive dilution from a hanging wall failure and negative model grade reconciliation.\nSubsequent to the reporting period, on January 9, 2018, we announced that following an extensive review of the operational performance at True North, management decided to place the mine under care and maintenance to review strategic options and to provide optionality at higher metal prices. This decision was largely based on the site's inability to achieve planned operating and cash flow targets in 2017 and to refocus our resources on our Nevada assets. We will continue to process tailings through the mill for the near future in order to maximize cash flow and offset expected care and maintenance costs.\nAll-in sustaining costs\nTotal Company all in sustaining costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,149 per gold ounce sold. For 2018, the Company expects to have all in sustaining costs for the year of $940 to $990 per gold ounce sold. (These are non-GAAP measures; refer to the Non-GAAP Performance Measures section of the MD&A for additional detail).\nFire Creek (Nevada Operations)\nFire Creek is 100% owned, fully-permitted, and was acquired by Klondex in 1975. Production began in 2014 under the bulk sample permit. Fire Creek is located in north-central Nevada in Lander County approximately 16 miles south of a major highway (Interstate-80) near other large gold deposits and mines which are owned and operated by major mining companies. Fire Creek is a high-grade, epithermal vein deposit, and the land package covers approximately 19,000 acres (~30.0 square miles). Ore mined from Fire Creek is trucked to Midas for processing in the milling facility. The following table provides a summary of Fire Creek operating results and period-over-period changes.\n\nOperations and costs - Fire Creek's performance in 2017 was in line with expectations as it produced 108,126 GEOs. For the year, 123,754 tons were mined at a grade of 0.90 GEOs per ton. Fire Creek was able to increase production year-over-year due to increased ore tonnage mined and milled with consistently high grades. Over the past three years we have focused on completing the required development and drilling to responsibly increase Fire Creek's annual production through increased tonnage as it has the lowest cost structure in our portfolio due to its high grades. We have been able to increase and sustain the mining rate through additions in underground mining equipment and employees. Due largely to the grades at Fire Creek, we have been able to maintain a $479 production cash costs per GEO structure, which was slightly above the high end of our annual expectation of $450.\nSpending - 2017 spending was $26.0 million for capital and $2.8 million for exploration. Capital expenditures were slightly lower than annual expectation of $27 - 29 million. For details of capital expenditures and the classification between sustaining and non-sustaining (growth) refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nMidas Mine (Nevada Operations)\nMidas is 100% owned, fully-permitted, and was acquired by Klondex in February 2014. Midas is located in north-central Nevada in Elko County approximately 58 miles east of Winnemucca, Nevada, near other large gold deposits and mines which are owned and operated by major mining companies. Midas is a low-sulphidation, epithermal vein deposit, and the land package covers approximately 30,000 acres (~47.0 square miles). The following table provides a summary of Midas operating results and period-over-period changes.\n\nOperations and costs - The Midas mine preformed in line with guidance for the year. For the year, 156,927 tons were mined at a grade of 0.33 GEOs per ton. Gold equivalent mill head grades increased 14.3% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to mining higher grade areas. Average mill head grades remained consistent to the mill head grades in 2015. We experience cost and recovery rate synergies from processing ore from Fire Creek and Hollister at Midas; however, during 2017, 2016 and 2015, production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization per GEO exceeded the price of gold and were subject to write downs. Mineral properties and depletion are amortized on a reserve gold equivalent ounces. (see Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nSpending - 2017 spending was $16.3 million for capital for both Midas mine and the Midas mill and came in line with our annual expectation of $15 - 18 million. For details of capital expenditures and the classification between sustaining and non-sustaining (growth) refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nMidas Mill (Nevada Operations)\nOre from Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister are processed at the Midas mill, which has a design capacity of 1,200 tons per day. Run-of-mine ore is crushed to 100% passing 1/2\" in a conventional two-stage crushing circuit which utilizes a primary jaw crusher and a secondary cone crusher with the circuit closed by a double deck vibrating screen. During 2017 the Company began to process Hollister ore at the Midas mill. The company converted four of the mill's leach tanks to carbon in leach (\"CIL\") to allow Hollister ore to be processed. The commissioning of the new CIL circuit is in process while the Company tests ore blends from the Nevada mines to yield the most favorable results. The Company is in a favorable position to now have three mines in Northern Nevada feeding one central mill, providing significant operating flexibility to optimize profitability.\nThe Company also added a tails thickener to the Midas mill. The addition of the thickener will extend the life of the tailings facilities and reduce future capital expenditures for tailing facilities following the completion of the 2018 expansion. The Company anticipates $16 to $18 million of capital to be spent in 2018 on the expansion of the tailings facility at the Midas mill.\nHollister (Nevada Operations)\nThe Hollister mine is a fully-permitted past producing underground and open pit operation, located in north-central Nevada in Elko County. Hollister does not have milling or processing facilities but is located approximately 17 miles away from the Midas mill, which currently has capacity to process additional tons. Hollister is an important asset to us since we believe there are significant synergies and cost savings with our Nevada operations through low transportation costs, reduced per ton milling costs, and shared general and administrative costs. Further, certain of our executives and management previously operated the historical underground operations and exploration programs at Hollister and believe that exploration targets with significant potential exist within the property boundary. We believe Hollister provides us with an opportunity to strategically and responsibly grow our business in Nevada, a mining friendly jurisdiction, while leveraging our technical expertise in narrow-vein underground mining and past experience with the project.\n\nOperations and costs - The Hollister mine had its best quarter of mining in the fourth quarter, mining over 9,000 GEOs, as the majority of the underground rehab was completed in the third quarter and development was advanced providing additional access to the Gloria vein. For the quarter, Hollister mined 20,440 tons at a grade of 0.44 GEOs per ton. For the year, Hollister mined 66,453 tons at a grade of 0.38 GEOs per ton. In 2017, recovered GEOs were 7,371. Sold GEOs for the year totaled 5,281 GEOs. Stockpiles at the end of 2017 contained approximately 15,000 GEOs from 44,000 tons at a GEO grade of 0.40 ounces per ton.\nMetallurgical test work is being performed to identify processing improvements to increase the gold and silver recoveries of the Hollister ore processed through the Midas mill. The recent mill modification, eliminating all cyanide in the grinding circuit, planned for the fourth quarter was not finished until the first week of January 2018. As a result, the decision was made to stockpile the Hollister ore during the fourth quarter in order to limit the risk of lower mill recoveries and less revenue. In 2018, the Company has already milled approximately 15,000 tons of Hollister ore at estimated gold and silver grades of 0.48 and 3.20 ounces per ton, respectively. Gold and silver recoveries for that material are estimated at approximately 80% and 60%, respectively. Ongoing metallurgical test work supports that gold recoveries of 85-90% can be achieved with additional modifications to the Midas mill circuit, including increasing leach time and finer grinding. Design and engineering of these modifications are being evaluated but are expected to be achievable with minimal capital investments.\nSpending - During the year ended December 31, 2017 total capital spending was $6.7 million and development and project costs totaled $10.6 million. For details of capital expenditures refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nCommunity - On August 17, 2017, the Company completed the donation of the Rock Creek lands, (more than 3,200 acres of lands), to the Battle Mountain Band of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada.\nAurora updates\nAurora project overview\nThe Aurora project is a fully-permitted past producing underground and open pit operation, located in west-central Nevada in Mineral County. Aurora has a 350 ton per day milling and processing facility, which provides us an opportunity to reprocess tailings from an existing tailing facility on the property and to consider toll milling services. Further, certain of our executives and management previously operated Aurora and believe that exploration targets with significant potential exist within the property boundary. We believe Aurora provides us with an opportunity to strategically and responsibly grow our business in Nevada.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017, we performed rehab work on the carbon stripping circuit, carbon regeneration circuit and mill. During the second quarter of 2017, we identified an opportunity to process mineralized material contained within the existing tailings facilities at the project. Processing of this material began in the fourth quarter of 2017 and we recovered 986 GEOs on carbon which will be stripped beginning in 2018.\nTrue North (Manitoba, Canada)\nTrue North, located in Manitoba, Canada, is 100% owned, fully-permitted, and was acquired on January 22, 2016. True North is a past producing underground gold mining operation consisting of three underground deposits with a modern, fully-permitted mill. Under previous ownership, mining took place at True North continuously from 2007 until May 2015, when the operation was placed on care and maintenance. True North was placed into production towards the end of the third quarter of 2016 following the release of an updated mineral reserve and resource estimate.\n\nOperations and costs - At True North, we milled 216,978 ore tons, from mining operations, at an average milled head grade of 0.12 gold ounces per ton, producing 24,636 GEOs. We also processed 80,848 tons from the True North tailings at an average grade of 0.04 gold ounces per ton, producing an additional 3,285 gold ounces.\nAfter the Company performed an extensive review of the operational performance at True North and the 2018 objectives of the Company as a whole, management decided to place the mine under care and maintenance to review strategic options and to provide optionality at higher metal prices. This decision was largely based on the site's inability to achieve planned operating and cash flow targets in 2017 and to refocus the Company's resources on Nevada assets. The Company will continue to process tailings through the mill for the near future in order to maximize cash flow and offset expected care and maintenance costs.\nThe Company recognized write-downs to production inventories of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 5. Inventories to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nSpending - For the year ended December 31, 2017, spending was $14.5 million for capital and $0.2 million for exploration. For details of capital expenditures refer to the Investing cash flows part of the Financial position, liquidity, and capital resources section of this MD&A.\nFinancial position, liquidity, and capital resources\nGeneral strategy\nTo maintain sufficient liquid assets and access to capital resources, we regularly perform short and long-term cash flow forecasts using current assumptions of future gold and silver prices, foreign exchange rates, production volumes, and operating, exploration, development and capital costs. Our liquidity and capital resources management strategy entails a disciplined approach by monitoring the timing and amount of any investment in our mines, projects, or exploration properties, while continually remaining in a position which we believe will allow us to respond to changes in our business environment, such as a decrease in metal prices, or other factors beyond our control.\nOur capital structure consists of a mixture of debt and shareholders' equity. We regularly review our capital structure and evaluate various financing options and strategies that: (1) may improve our current liquidity and financial condition, (2) are attainable on favorable and reasonable terms, and (3) are permissible under our existing debt arrangements and other obligations. Such financing options may include, but are not limited to, additional or increases in revolving borrowing facilities, equipment financing, term loan facilities, refinancing existing obligations, and/or the issuance of equity securities, warrants, or other instruments.\nRisk management contracts\nIn order to increase the certainty of expected future cash flows, from time to time we may enter into financial instruments for a portion of our forecast gold and silver sales over the next one to twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into forward trades which covered 171,036 and 1,084,896 gold and silver ounces at average prices of $1,261 and $17.24, respectively. Additionally, we entered into various short-term zero cost gold collars during the year. The collars ranged in floor and ceiling prices and in quantity of ounces. As of December 31, 2017, all gold forward trades and collars had either expired, were sold, or were executed and we did not have any outstanding (see Note 11. Derivatives to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail). Other than the aforementioned, we have not entered into any other significant contracts to hedge or manage market risks arising from changes in metal prices, diesel and propane costs, and currency and interest rates. We will continually and actively monitor applicable markets and quotes and may consider entering into additional hedging agreements and contracts if determined to be advantageous by management and the Board, and if such transactions are permissible under our existing debt agreements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs discussed below in the Sources and uses of cash section, at December 31, 2017, our Cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $23.7 million, decreasing $24.0 million from the December 31, 2016 balance of $47.6 million largely due to investing cash outflows of $66.4 million primarily related to capital expenditures, which were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $26.4 million and cash provided by financing activities of $15.7 million.\nDue to the nature of our operations and the composition of our balance sheet assets, as of December 31, 2017, our current assets, which included Cash and cash equivalents of $23.7 million and Inventories of $42.6 million, represented substantially all of our liquid assets on hand. We have access to additional liquidity under our $40.0 million Revolver, of which $5.0 million was available as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $37.4 million. The following chart provides a summary of our working capital, Revolver availability, and estimated liquidity for the last three years (in thousands):\nOur working capital increased by $4.2 million (approximately 12.57%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and our working capital ratio increased to 2.02. The following table summarizes working capital (in thousands, except working capital ratio):\n\nWorking capital changes related to the decrease in total current assets were primarily attributable to a $24.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents (discussed below in the Sources and uses of cash section), offset by a $21.3 million increase in inventory primarily as a result of Hollister operations stockpiling ore during its ramp up throughout the year ended December 31, 2017. Working capital changes related to the decrease in total current liabilities were primarily attributable to a decrease in current debt as a result of the repayment of the Gold Purchase Agreement during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncluded in working capital are Inventories, which include production-related inventories that can provide us with additional cash liquidity in excess of their December 31, 2017 carrying value of $33.3 million due to a cash margin we expect to realize at the time of sale. The following table summarizes the estimated recoverable gold and silver ounces contained in our Inventories and the underlying amount of revenue which may be generated from their sale using December 31, 2017 period-end prices, which would be further reduced for any remaining processing and refining costs (in thousands, except ounces and period-end prices):\n\nOur December 31, 2017 working capital, available sources of liquidity, and future operating cash flows will be used, in part, to fund recurring operating and production costs, make principal and interest payments on debt, and to fund capital expenditures and exploration and development costs at our mines and projects. At current gold and silver price levels, and when using our estimates of future production and costs, we believe our cash flows from operating activities together with our working capital and Revolver, will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next 12 months. See the Contractual obligations section for additional detail on the timing and amounts of our future cash requirements.\nSources and uses of cash\n\nOperating Cash Flows - Our cash flows from operations are largely impacted by the number of ounces sold, average realized prices, and production costs. As shown in the table below, during 2017, 2016, and 2015 operating cash flows were positively impacted by GEO's sold (in thousands, except ounces).\n\nInvesting cash flows - The largest cash use in investing activities occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, in which cash outflows for the Hollister Acquisition and True North Acquisition (as defined herein) totaled $100.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we funded capital expenditures for mineral properties, plant and equipment in the amounts of $65.6 million, $61.7 million, and $36.6 million, respectively. The following tables summarize our capital expenditures for 2017 (in thousands):\n\nFinancing Cash Flows - Proceeds from the issuance of share capital, which generally included bought deal financings and option and warrant exercises, benefited our cash balances by $3.3 million, $105.9 million, and $24.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Other financing cash flows are attributable to borrowings and repayments of debt agreements, which includes the early payment of the Gold Purchase Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 8. Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail).\nForeign Currency Effect on Cash - A portion of our Cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts denominated in Canadian dollars. Generally speaking, when the US dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, we experience negative foreign currency translation adjustments on our Canadian dollar cash balances (the opposite is true when the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar). Changes in exchange rates resulted in an increase to our cash balance of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreases to our cash balances of $1.6 million and $3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table provides a listing of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any material operating lease obligations or firm purchase obligations. In addition to the above, our mines and projects are subject to certain royalty commitments as disclosed in Note 21. Commitments and contingencies.\nDebt covenants\nOur debt agreements contain certain representations and warranties, restrictions, events of default, and covenants, customary for agreements of these types. Additionally, the Revolver contains financial covenants which require us to maintain a Tangible Net Worth not less than $100.0 million, a Gearing Ratio (a measure of debt to EBITDA) not greater than 4.00:1, a Cash Balance not less than $10.0 million, and a Current Ratio not less than 1.10:1 (as such terms are defined in the Revolver). The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nOutstanding share capital\nAs of March 9, 2018, there were 179,614,947 common shares, 4,033,138 options, 10,001,242 warrants, 1,390,342 RSUs, 507,633 PSUs outstanding, and 195,547,302 common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNon-GAAP performance measures\nWe have included the non-GAAP measures \"Cash revenue from operations\", \"Cash production costs from operations\", \"Cash margin from operations\", \"Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\", \"All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\" and \"All-in costs per gold ounce sold\" in this MD&A (collectively, the \"Non-GAAP Measures\"). These Non-GAAP Measures are used internally to assess our operating and economic performance and to provide key performance information to management. We believe that these Non-GAAP Measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flows required to fund and sustain our business. These Non-GAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These Non-GAAP Measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP, and therefore may not be comparable to or consistent with measures used by other issuers or with amounts presented in our financial statements.\nOur primary business is gold production and our current and future operations, development, exploration, and life-of-mine plans primarily focus on maximizing returns from such gold production. As a result, our Non-GAAP Measures are calculated and disclosed on a per gold or gold equivalent ounce basis.\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold presents our cash costs associated with the production of gold equivalent ounces and, as such, non-cash depreciation and depletion charges are excluded. Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis, and includes all direct and indirect operating costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (State of Nevada net proceeds and other such taxes are excluded). We believe that converting the benefits from selling silver ounces into gold ounces is helpful to analysts and investors as it best represents the way we operate, which is to maximize returns from gold production. Gold equivalent ounces are computed using the number of silver ounces required to generate the revenue derived from the sale of one gold ounce, using average realized selling prices (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Fire Creek, Midas, and Hollister to the \"Nevada Total\" for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a reconciliation of Fire Creek and Midas for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\n\nAll-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\nAll-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.\nOur calculation of AISC per gold ounce sold is consistent with the June 2013 guidance released by the World Gold Council, a non-regulatory, non-profit market development organization for the gold industry. AISC per gold ounce sold reflects the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project, including costs required to discover and develop new sources of production; therefore, capital amounts related to expansion and growth projects are included.\nAISC per gold ounce sold includes all: (1) direct and indirect operating cash costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) asset retirement and accretion expenses, and (4) sustaining capital expenditures, the total of which is reduced for revenues earned from silver sales. Certain cash expenditures, including State of Nevada net proceeds and other related taxes, federal tax payments, and financing costs are excluded.\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold includes additional costs which reflect the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project. We calculate our all-in costs per gold ounce sold by beginning with the AISC total and adding non-sustaining (growth) capital expenditures and exploration and development expenditures.\n\nFor a
