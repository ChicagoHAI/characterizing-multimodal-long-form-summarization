Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nMTBC is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) platform is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We employ a highly educated workforce of more than 1,700 people in Pakistan and 100 in Sri Lanka, where we believe labor costs are approximately one-half the cost of comparable India-based employees and one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees, thus enabling us to deliver our solutions at competitive prices.\nOur flagship offering, PracticePro, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use \u2018big practice solutions' to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Electronic health records (or EHR), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our customers to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Revenue cycle management (or RCM) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Mobile Health (or mHealth) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdoption of our solutions requires only a modest upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues is based on a percentage of our clients' collections. For new customers other than those obtained through acquisitions, the standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution averages approximately 5% of a practice's healthcare-related revenues plus a small one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry.\nAs a result of the SoftCare acquisition, the Company has a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. Also as a result of this acquisition, the Company has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to record, manage and control the exchange of information. As a result of the WFS acquisition, the Company has a printing and mailing operation.\nOur growth strategy involves two approaches: acquiring smaller RCM companies and then migrating the customers of those companies to our solutions, as well as partnering with EHR and other vendors that lack an integrated solution and integrating our solutions with their offerings. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe we will also be able to accelerate organic growth by partnering with industry participants, utilizing them as channel partners to offer integrated solutions to their customers. We have entered into arrangements with industry participants from which we began to derive revenue starting in mid-2014, including emerging EHR providers and other healthcare vendors that lack a full suite of solutions. We have developed application interfaces with several EHR systems, as well as providers of paper-based clinical forms to create integrated offerings, together with device and lab integration.\nOur Pakistan operations accounted for approximately 26% and 33% of total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of those expenses were personnel-related costs (approximately 75% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015). Because personnel-related costs are significantly lower in Pakistan than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our Pakistan operations give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the medical billing companies that we have acquired use domestic labor or subcontractors from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these labor costs to Pakistan.\nOn October 3, 2016, MTBC Acquisition, Corp. ( MAC\u201d), a newly formed, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTBC, acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of MediGain, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ( Millennium\u201d) (together MediGain\u201d). The assets, including accounts receivable, customer relationships, fixed assets and two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries of MediGain, located in India and Sri Lanka, were acquired through a strict foreclosure process whereby MAC acquired senior secured notes secured by the assets of MediGain, and immediately thereafter foreclosed on the assets in satisfaction of the senior secured notes. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $7 million. Of this amount, $2 million was paid at closing and the balance is due April 1, 2018.\nIn connection with this acquisition, MTBC expects to generate at least $10 million of annual revenue from the customers acquired. Although there is no assurance that the customers will remain with MTBC, the Company expects that this acquisition will be accretive to earnings during 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to integrate the acquired operations with MTBC, but will have offshore operations in Sri Lanka and India as well as Pakistan, and in the short term, we will have a significant number of additional U.S.-based employees from MediGain.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP.\u201d) Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on our debt; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and asset impairment charges and other non-cash non-operating expenditures;

measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess market share trends and working capital needs. We believe information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business.\nSet forth below are our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted for approximately 71% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 85% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFirst Pass Acceptance Rate: We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding. Clearinghouses are third parties that process the submission of claims to insurers and require compliance with insurance companies' formatting and other submission rules before submitting those claims. For the purposes of calculating first pass acceptance rate, consistent with industry practice, we exclude claims submitted under real-time adjudication procedures, which are procedures that allow a healthcare provider to determine, at the point of care, if a service they are rendering will be paid. Our first-time acceptance rate was approximately 96% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 95% for the year ended December 31, 2015, which compares favorably to the average of the top twelve payers of approximately 95%, as reported by the American Medical Association.\nFirst Pass Resolution Rate: First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 93% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDays in Accounts Receivable: Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients' median days in accounts receivable was approximately 33 days for primary care and 40 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2016, and approximately 35 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the national average of 40 days, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association, an association for professional administrators and leaders of medical group practices. Higher first pass resolution rates and effective follow-up helped us to achieve this rate, which reduces our customers' collection cycle of claims, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer Renewal Rate: Our customer renewal rate measures the percentage of our clients who were a party to a services agreement with us on January 1 of a particular year and continued to operate and be a client on December 31 of the same year. It also includes acquired accounts, if they are a party to a services agreement with the company we acquired and are generating revenue for us, so long as the risk of client loss under the respective purchase agreement has fully shifted to us by January 1 of the particular year. Our renewal rates for 2016 and 2015 were 85% and 79%, respectively. The renewal rates for our customers who are also users of our EHR for 2016 and 2015 were 97% and 99%, respectively. The percentage of our revenue we generated during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 which came from all users of our EHR was 39% and 45%, respectively.\nProviders and Practices Served: As of December 31, 2016, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 2,800 providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services), representing approximately 830 practices. In addition, we served approximately 250 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 1,500 providers representing approximately 730 practices.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue: We primarily derive our revenues from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes RCM as well as the ability to use our electronic health records and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These payments accounted for approximately 88% and 92% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. This includes customers utilizing our proprietary product suite, PracticePro, as well as customers from acquisitions which we are servicing utilizing third-party software. Key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers we are servicing, the number of patients served by those providers, and collections by those providers. We also generate revenues from one-time setup fees we charge for implementing PracticePro; the sale of our stand-alone web-based EHR solution, ChartsPro; and from transcription, coding, indexing and other ancillary services. Our plan is to move customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies wherever feasible without jeopardizing the client relationship. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we moved approximately 64% of the medical billing customers from the 2016, 2015 and 2014 Acquisitions to our operating platform.\nAs a result of the SoftCare acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we earned approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of our revenue from clearinghouse and EDI clients. As a result of the WFS acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we earned approximately 3% of our revenue from printing and mailing operations.\nOperating Expenses\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing costs, and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Pakistan operations accounted for approximately 33% and 44% of direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As we grow, we expect to achieve further economies of scale and to see our direct operating costs decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel, advertising expenses. These have been relatively low in the past (under 2% of our revenue through 2015), as we have often found it to be more economical to grow by the acquisition of other medical billing companies than by engaging in directed marketing efforts to prospective customers. However, in October 2016 we hired four sales and marketing personnel as part of MediGain acquisition. Going forward, we intend to invest in marketing, business development and sales resources to expand our market share, building on our existing customer base.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. Because we incorporate our technology into our services as soon as technological feasibility is established, most costs are currently expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in the future in absolute terms, but decrease as a percentage of revenue. Consistent with our growth plans, we are hiring developers, analysts and project managers in an effort to streamline our operational processes and further develop our products.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. Our Pakistan office accounted for approximately 26% and 29% of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContingent Consideration. Contingent consideration represents the amount payable to the sellers of the Acquisitions based on the achievement of defined performance measures contained in the purchase agreements. For the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, the contingent consideration consists of amounts due in cash and for one of the sellers of the 2014 Acquisitions, amounts due in the Company's common stock. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\t\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. Depreciation for computers is calculated over three years, while remaining assets (except leasehold improvements) are depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the economic life of those assets.\nAmortization expense through the second quarter of 2015 was charged on a straight-line basis over a period of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, including customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete, as well as purchased software. We concluded that three years reflects the period during which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. For customer contracts and relationships relating to the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, amortization was charged using the double declining balance method over three years, as the Company concluded that the double declining balance method was more appropriate based on its historical experience as the majority of the cash flows are expected to be recognized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2016, our acquisitions and purchases of customer relationships added $4.8 million of intangibles. Amortization related to the 2016 Acquisitions was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, our acquisitions and purchase of customer relationships added $1,083,000 of intangibles. Amortization related to the 2015 Acquisitions and the purchase of the customer relationships was $422,000 and $212,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense). Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit, term loans and notes issued in connection with acquisitions, offset by interest income. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and amounted to a foreign exchange loss of $92,000 and a foreign exchange gain of $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the accounting policies below are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContingent consideration\nIf a business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. As a result of the Acquisitions, the Company adjusts the contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period based on fair value inputs representing changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock, changes in forecasted revenue of the acquired entities and the probability of an adjustment to the purchase price. Critical estimates include determining the forecasted revenue for certain acquisitions, probability and timing of cash collections and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date are included in earnings if the contingent consideration is recorded as a liability and are included in equity if the contingent consideration is recorded as an equity instrument.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 31st, referred to as the annual test date. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting-unit level. The Company has determined that its business consists of a single reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the use of a discount cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions and judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant's viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected client retention rates, expected future cash inflows and outflows and estimated useful lives of those intangible assets. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide an allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. If necessary, provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables. In determining the provision, we analyze our historical collection experience, the aging of our accounts receivable, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. We reassess this allowance each reporting period.

Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $1.1 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2015 Acquisitions.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Direct operating costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,416,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,630,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,786,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,224,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,458,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,969,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(715,495 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,786,367 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,580,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,178,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,394,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,538,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,856,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating costs of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.8 million or 15% from direct operating costs of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The MediGain Acquisition increased salary costs by $1.7 million and $374,000 in the U.S. and offshore, respectively, and subcontractor costs by $750,000. Postage and delivery costs increased by $517,000 due to the acquisitions of WFS and MediGain. Salary and other direct operating costs in Pakistan decreased by $1.1 million or 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the reduction in the number of employees in Pakistan who were hired to service customers of the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions. Salary costs in the U.S. decreased by $1.3 million or 32% due to the reduction in the number of employees acquired from the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions due to the transition of customers to the MTBC platform, utilizing technology and offshore labor instead of U.S. personnel. This savings was partially offset by approximately $1 million of payroll expense related to employees obtain in connection with the 2016 Acquisitions other than MediGain. In addition, software platform costs increased by $245,000 and travel and entertainment costs increased by $399,000 from 2015 due to the 2016 acquisition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2016 salary and benefit costs for the subsidiary in Poland increased by $79,000.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $757,000 or 162% from selling and marketing expense of $467,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company hired additional sales and marketing personnel and transferred existing personnel into these positions as a step towards increasing revenue of the Company, and with the acquisition of MediGain, there was a further increase of $255,000 in salaries due to MediGain's established sales and marketing team.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $12.5 million increased by $490,000 or 4% from general and administrative expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additional expenses resulted primarily from the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, including payroll, facilities and legal and professional costs. The MediGain acquisition increased salary cost by $1.1 million. Legal and professional costs increased by $331,000 or 26%, in part due to transaction costs related to the MediGain acquisition. These increases in costs were offset by decreases in other general and administrative costs. Salary expense in the U.S. decreased by $329,000 or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in the number of employees. Other general and administrative costs including occupancy expenses decreased by approximately $724,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense of $902,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $243,000 or 37% from research and development expense of $659,000 in the prior year, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan performing software development work.\nContingent Consideration. The change in contingent consideration of $715,000 and $1.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, relates to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. This gain resulted primarily from changes in the revenue estimates for the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions and also from a decrease in the price of the Company's common stock for the Practicare shares held in escrow. The settlement of the Omni shares and the forfeiture of all the shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of CastleRock contributed to the change for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation. Depreciation of $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $107,000 or 25% from depreciation of $420,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of additional property and equipment purchases and the MediGain Acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $402,000 or 10% from amortization expense of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase resulted from the intangible assets acquired in connection with our Acquisitions, which are primarily being amortized over three years.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(682,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(288,406 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(393,677 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (expense) income - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,276 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(223,557 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(131 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income. Interest income of $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $10,000 or 36% from interest income of $27,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income primarily represents late fees from customers.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense of $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $394,000 or 137% from interest expense of $288,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to interest on higher borrowings under our term loans and the line of credit.\nOther Income (Expense) - net. Other expense - net was $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to other income - net of $170,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in other (expense) income are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily resulting from transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring measurement and settlement of such transactions.\nIncome Tax Provision. There was a $197,000 provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $59,000 compared to the provision for income taxes of $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, a $60,000 Federal income tax carryback claim was recorded which reduced total income tax expense. Included in the 2016 tax provision was a $174,000 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill. The pre-tax loss increased from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets of $7.2 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is (2%) and our Federal statutory tax rate is 34%. The primary reason for this difference pertains to the net operating loss incurred in the current year which could not be recorded as a benefit as the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, goodwill is tax deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax-deductibility of this indefinitely lived asset. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.\nDue to the fact that the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it is not netted against the Company's deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense.\nThe Company will maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. While our plan is to be profitable in the future and begin utilizing these deferred tax assets, there is not sufficient evidence to allow us to avoid the full valuation allowance in 2015 and 2016. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the timing and level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has state NOL carry forwards of approximately $10.8 million which will expire at various dates from 2034 to 2036. The Company has a Federal NOL carry forward of approximately $10.6 million which will expire between 2034 and 2036. The use of some of the Federal NOL carry forward is subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a cash balance of $3.5 million at December 31, 2016, and an outstanding balance of $9.3 million drawn on its credit facility with Opus Bank, which was fully utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the Opus credit agreement. During March 2017 Opus amended the covenants whereby the asset coverage ratio covenant was removed. There is a provision for a minimum balance during the month, as well as the ability to go below the minimum as long as the balance recovers in 5 days. The new covenants also contain minimum revenue and adjusted EBITDA requirements. If we raise additional capital through a sale of equity, a portion of the net proceeds will be used to pay down the term loans. Additionally, on June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2017, the interest rate on the Opus debt increases in steps by a total of 3.5%, from prime plus 1.75% to prime plus 5.25%.\nIn October the Company made an initial $2 million payment toward the MediGain acquisition, which had a total purchase price of $7 million, the remaining $5 million of which is unsecured. On March 29, 2017 the Company received a letter from Prudential that demanded immediate payment of $3 million of the remaining consideration that is now due together with accrued interest, and expressing Prudential's intention to collect on said amounts. The balance is due at a later date. The Company will require additional financing in order to make these payments.\nThere were negative cash flows from operations of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as the Company integrated the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions. In 2016, there was $898,000 negative cash flow from operations as the Company integrated its 2016 Acquisitions, the largest of which was MediGain. Due to operating losses in 2015 and 2016, the Company relies on the term loans and line of credit to fund operations.\nThe Company's available cash will not be sufficient to meet its current and anticipated cash requirements without additional financing. According, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm reported that conditions existed that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial information throughout this Annual Report and the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and these financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement believes that it will be necessary to raise additional funding, which might be in the form of sales of additional shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, its common stock, or some other instrument. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete any financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we issue equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we issue debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, we may incur debt service obligations, and we may become subject to restrictions limiting our ability to operate our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to obtain financing when needed may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years presented.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(897,842 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,882,781 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,833,482 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(602,423 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,503,006 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,900 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,562,682 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,990,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September 2015, the Company secured a $10 million credit facility from Opus Bank, including an initial $4 million term loan and a $2 million revolving line of credit. The proceeds of the term loan were used to fully repay the previous TD Bank line of credit and other notes payable. Additional term loans totaling $4 million from Opus were received in November 2015 and in March 2016.\nThe Company raised approximately $4.7 million of net proceeds from a public preferred stock offering in November 2015, and raised approximately $1.3 million of net proceeds from additional sales of the same preferred stock in July 2016.\nThe Company previously had a line of credit with TD Bank, which increased from $1.2 million to $3 million in March 2015, and was repaid in 2016 with proceeds from the Opus Bank term loan and closed.\nEffective December 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $500,000 stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company purchased 101,338 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $122,031. The plan ran through January 16, 2016.\nEffective January 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an additional $1,000,000 stock repurchase program. The program expired on January 25, 2017. Through December 31, 2016, the Company purchased an additional 644,565 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $546,145.\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $898,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the net loss of $4.1 million included the following changes in non-cash items: additional depreciation and amortization of $509,000, additional stock-based compensation of $1.2 million and decrease in change in contingent consideration of $1.1 million. Although revenue increased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, expenses increased by $5 million for the same period primarily due to the acquisition of MediGain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccounts receivable increased by $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a decrease of $520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a decrease of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.8 million, an increase of $3.2 million compared to $602,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in spending is primarily due to the initial payments of $1.25 million, $175,000 and $2 million for the GCB, RMB and MediGain acquisitions, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $157,000, compared to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash provided by financing activities in 2016 includes $2 million of additional term loan borrowings from Opus Bank before financing costs, offset by a $1.4 million repayment of debt obligations, $709,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000 of purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program. The cash provided by financing activities for 2015 represented borrowings on the Opus line of credit, net of repayments to TD Bank, $4.7 million from sale of preferred stock and $811,000 of repayment of debt obligations. Average borrowings from our revolving line of credit were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur line of credit with Opus Bank expires on September 1, 2018, unless renewed.

Our term loans with Opus Bank mature on September 1, 2019 and require monthly principal payments which began October 1, 2016 of approximately $222,000 per month and continue through the end of the loan period.\nThe Company raised $4.7 million from the sale of preferred stock after expenses in 2015 and $1.3 million in 2016. During 2016 and 2015, $709,000 and $48,000 of preferred stock dividends were paid, respectively.\nIn connection with the common stock buy-back program, the Company purchased 101,338 and 644,565 of its shares for an aggregate cost of $122,000 and $546,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. No shares were repurchased subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations under our term loans, line of credit, and in connection with our purchase of MediGain and contingent consideration in connection with the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions. We were in compliance with all Opus covenants in 2016. We also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment.\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under our long-term contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of December 31, 2016. In addition, based on the obligations as of December 31, 2016, we expected interest expense to be approximately $600,000 during the years below.

The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTBC\u201d or of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTBCP.\u201d\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with Nasdaq's Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had an initial period of 180 days, or until December 21, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement, which requires the closing bid for the common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this period. The Company was eligible and received an additional 180 day compliance period. The Company has issued a special proxy to its shareholders asking for approval to authorize the Board of Directors to approve a reverse stock split which will increase the price per share. The special shareholders' meeting is scheduled for April 14, 2017. The Board of Directors will then have the authority to approve the amount of the reverse stock split which could range from 1 for 3 to 1 for 8, if they deem this to be in the Company's best interest. The Company's failure to regain compliance during this additional 180 days compliance period could result in delisting.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nMTBC is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) platform is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We employ a highly educated workforce of more than 1,700 people in Pakistan and 100 in Sri Lanka, where we believe labor costs are approximately one-half the cost of comparable India-based employees and one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees, thus enabling us to deliver our solutions at competitive prices.\nOur flagship offering, PracticePro, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use \u2018big practice solutions' to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:\n \u25cf Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; \u25cf Electronic health records (or EHR), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our customers to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; \u25cf Revenue cycle management (or RCM) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and \u25cf Mobile Health (or mHealth) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. \nAdoption of our solutions requires only a modest upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues is based on a percentage of our clients' collections. For new customers other than those obtained through acquisitions, the standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution averages approximately 5% of a practice's healthcare-related revenues plus a small one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry.\nAs a result of the SoftCare acquisition, the Company has a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. Also as a result of this acquisition, the Company has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to record, manage and control the exchange of information. As a result of the WFS acquisition, the Company has a printing and mailing operation.\nOur growth strategy involves two approaches: acquiring smaller RCM companies and then migrating the customers of those companies to our solutions, as well as partnering with EHR and other vendors that lack an integrated solution and integrating our solutions with their offerings. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure.\n 35 \nWe believe we will also be able to accelerate organic growth by partnering with industry participants, utilizing them as channel partners to offer integrated solutions to their customers. We have entered into arrangements with industry participants from which we began to derive revenue starting in mid-2014, including emerging EHR providers and other healthcare vendors that lack a full suite of solutions. We have developed application interfaces with several EHR systems, as well as providers of paper-based clinical forms to create integrated offerings, together with device and lab integration.\nOur Pakistan operations accounted for approximately 26% and 33% of total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of those expenses were personnel-related costs (approximately 75% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015). Because personnel-related costs are significantly lower in Pakistan than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our Pakistan operations give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the medical billing companies that we have acquired use domestic labor or subcontractors from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these labor costs to Pakistan.\nOn October 3, 2016, MTBC Acquisition, Corp. ( MAC\u201d), a newly formed, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTBC, acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of MediGain, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ( Millennium\u201d) (together MediGain\u201d). The assets, including accounts receivable, customer relationships, fixed assets and two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries of MediGain, located in India and Sri Lanka, were acquired through a strict foreclosure process whereby MAC acquired senior secured notes secured by the assets of MediGain, and immediately thereafter foreclosed on the assets in satisfaction of the senior secured notes. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $7 million. Of this amount, $2 million was paid at closing and the balance is due April 1, 2018.\nIn connection with this acquisition, MTBC expects to generate at least $10 million of annual revenue from the customers acquired. Although there is no assurance that the customers will remain with MTBC, the Company expects that this acquisition will be accretive to earnings during 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to integrate the acquired operations with MTBC, but will have offshore operations in Sri Lanka and India as well as Pakistan, and in the short term, we will have a significant number of additional U.S.-based employees from MediGain.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP.\u201d) Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\n \u25cf Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \u25cf Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on our debt; \u25cf Foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and asset impairment charges and other non-cash non-operating expenditures; \u25cf Stock-based compensation expense, including customer incentives paid in stock and related fees, and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price; \n 36 \nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, and does not reflect any cash requirements for replacement for capital expenditures;

review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess market share trends and working capital needs. We believe information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business.\nSet forth below are our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted for approximately 71% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 85% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFirst Pass Acceptance Rate: We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding. Clearinghouses are third parties that process the submission of claims to insurers and require compliance with insurance companies' formatting and other submission rules before submitting those claims. For the purposes of calculating first pass acceptance rate, consistent with industry practice, we exclude claims submitted under real-time adjudication procedures, which are procedures that allow a healthcare provider to determine, at the point of care, if a service they are rendering will be paid. Our first-time acceptance rate was approximately 96% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 95% for the year ended December 31, 2015, which compares favorably to the average of the top twelve payers of approximately 95%, as reported by the American Medical Association.\nFirst Pass Resolution Rate: First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 93% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDays in Accounts Receivable: Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients' median days in accounts receivable was approximately 33 days for primary care and 40 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2016, and approximately 35 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the national average of 40 days, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association, an association for professional administrators and leaders of medical group practices. Higher first pass resolution rates and effective follow-up helped us to achieve this rate, which reduces our customers' collection cycle of claims, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\n 40 \nCustomer Renewal Rate: Our customer renewal rate measures the percentage of our clients who were a party to a services agreement with us on January 1 of a particular year and continued to operate and be a client on December 31 of the same year. It also includes acquired accounts, if they are a party to a services agreement with the company we acquired and are generating revenue for us, so long as the risk of client loss under the respective purchase agreement has fully shifted to us by January 1 of the particular year. Our renewal rates for 2016 and 2015 were 85% and 79%, respectively. The renewal rates for our customers who are also users of our EHR for 2016 and 2015 were 97% and 99%, respectively. The percentage of our revenue we generated during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 which came from all users of our EHR was 39% and 45%, respectively.\nProviders and Practices Served: As of December 31, 2016, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 2,800 providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services), representing approximately 830 practices. In addition, we served approximately 250 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 1,500 providers representing approximately 730 practices.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue: We primarily derive our revenues from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes RCM as well as the ability to use our electronic health records and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These payments accounted for approximately 88% and 92% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. This includes customers utilizing our proprietary product suite, PracticePro, as well as customers from acquisitions which we are servicing utilizing third-party software. Key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers we are servicing, the number of patients served by those providers, and collections by those providers. We also generate revenues from one-time setup fees we charge for implementing PracticePro; the sale of our stand-alone web-based EHR solution, ChartsPro; and from transcription, coding, indexing and other ancillary services. Our plan is to move customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies wherever feasible without jeopardizing the client relationship. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we moved approximately 64% of the medical billing customers from the 2016, 2015 and 2014 Acquisitions to our operating platform.\nAs a result of the SoftCare acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we earned approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of our revenue from clearinghouse and EDI clients. As a result of the WFS acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we earned approximately 3% of our revenue from printing and mailing operations.\nOperating Expenses\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing costs, and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Pakistan operations accounted for approximately 33% and 44% of direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As we grow, we expect to achieve further economies of scale and to see our direct operating costs decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel, advertising expenses. These have been relatively low in the past (under 2% of our revenue through 2015), as we have often found it to be more economical to grow by the acquisition of other medical billing companies than by engaging in directed marketing efforts to prospective customers. However, in October 2016 we hired four sales and marketing personnel as part of MediGain acquisition. Going forward, we intend to invest in marketing, business development and sales resources to expand our market share, building on our existing customer base.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. Because we incorporate our technology into our services as soon as technological feasibility is established, most costs are currently expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in the future in absolute terms, but decrease as a percentage of revenue. Consistent with our growth plans, we are hiring developers, analysts and project managers in an effort to streamline our operational processes and further develop our products.\n 41 \nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. Our Pakistan office accounted for approximately 26% and 29% of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContingent Consideration. Contingent consideration represents the amount payable to the sellers of the Acquisitions based on the achievement of defined performance measures contained in the purchase agreements. For the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, the contingent consideration consists of amounts due in cash and for one of the sellers of the 2014 Acquisitions, amounts due in the Company's common stock. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\t\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. Depreciation for computers is calculated over three years, while remaining assets (except leasehold improvements) are depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the economic life of those assets.\nAmortization expense through the second quarter of 2015 was charged on a straight-line basis over a period of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, including customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete, as well as purchased software. We concluded that three years reflects the period during which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. For customer contracts and relationships relating to the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, amortization was charged using the double declining balance method over three years, as the Company concluded that the double declining balance method was more appropriate based on its historical experience as the majority of the cash flows are expected to be recognized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2016, our acquisitions and purchases of customer relationships added $4.8 million of intangibles. Amortization related to the 2016 Acquisitions was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, our acquisitions and purchase of customer relationships added $1,083,000 of intangibles. Amortization related to the 2015 Acquisitions and the purchase of the customer relationships was $422,000 and $212,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense). Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit, term loans and notes issued in connection with acquisitions, offset by interest income. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and amounted to a foreign exchange loss of $92,000 and a foreign exchange gain of $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n 42 \nWe believe that the accounting policies below are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContingent consideration\nIf a business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. As a result of the Acquisitions, the Company adjusts the contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period based on fair value inputs representing changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock, changes in forecasted revenue of the acquired entities and the probability of an adjustment to the purchase price. Critical estimates include determining the forecasted revenue for certain acquisitions, probability and timing of cash collections and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date are included in earnings if the contingent consideration is recorded as a liability and are included in equity if the contingent consideration is recorded as an equity instrument.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 31st, referred to as the annual test date. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting-unit level. The Company has determined that its business consists of a single reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the use of a discount cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions and judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant's viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected client retention rates, expected future cash inflows and outflows and estimated useful lives of those intangible assets. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide an allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. If necessary, provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables. In determining the provision, we analyze our historical collection experience, the aging of our accounts receivable, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. We reassess this allowance each reporting period. If actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates, adjustments to this allowance may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations.\n 43 \n \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years shown.\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Direct operating costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.4 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (expense) income - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.0 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of 2016 and 2015\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,493,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,079,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,413,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.4 million or 6% from revenue of $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7.3 million and $2.9 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, respectively, offset by attrition from customers obtained primarily from the 2014 Acquisitions. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $1.1 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2015 Acquisitions.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Direct operating costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,416,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,630,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,786,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,224,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,458,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,969,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(715,495 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,786,367 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,580,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,178,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,394,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,538,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,856,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 44 \n \nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating costs of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.8 million or 15% from direct operating costs of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The MediGain Acquisition increased salary costs by $1.7 million and $374,000 in the U.S. and offshore, respectively, and subcontractor costs by $750,000. Postage and delivery costs increased by $517,000 due to the acquisitions of WFS and MediGain. Salary and other direct operating costs in Pakistan decreased by $1.1 million or 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the reduction in the number of employees in Pakistan who were hired to service customers of the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions. Salary costs in the U.S. decreased by $1.3 million or 32% due to the reduction in the number of employees acquired from the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions due to the transition of customers to the MTBC platform, utilizing technology and offshore labor instead of U.S. personnel. This savings was partially offset by approximately $1 million of payroll expense related to employees obtain in connection with the 2016 Acquisitions other than MediGain. In addition, software platform costs increased by $245,000 and travel and entertainment costs increased by $399,000 from 2015 due to the 2016 acquisition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2016 salary and benefit costs for the subsidiary in Poland increased by $79,000.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $757,000 or 162% from selling and marketing expense of $467,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company hired additional sales and marketing personnel and transferred existing personnel into these positions as a step towards increasing revenue of the Company, and with the acquisition of MediGain, there was a further increase of $255,000 in salaries due to MediGain's established sales and marketing team.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $12.5 million increased by $490,000 or 4% from general and administrative expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additional expenses resulted primarily from the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, including payroll, facilities and legal and professional costs. The MediGain acquisition increased salary cost by $1.1 million. Legal and professional costs increased by $331,000 or 26%, in part due to transaction costs related to the MediGain acquisition. These increases in costs were offset by decreases in other general and administrative costs. Salary expense in the U.S. decreased by $329,000 or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in the number of employees. Other general and administrative costs including occupancy expenses decreased by approximately $724,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense of $902,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $243,000 or 37% from research and development expense of $659,000 in the prior year, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan performing software development work.\nContingent Consideration. The change in contingent consideration of $715,000 and $1.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, relates to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. This gain resulted primarily from changes in the revenue estimates for the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions and also from a decrease in the price of the Company's common stock for the Practicare shares held in escrow. The settlement of the Omni shares and the forfeiture of all the shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of CastleRock contributed to the change for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation. Depreciation of $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $107,000 or 25% from depreciation of $420,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of additional property and equipment purchases and the MediGain Acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $402,000 or 10% from amortization expense of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase resulted from the intangible assets acquired in connection with our Acquisitions, which are primarily being amortized over three years.\n 45 \n \nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(682,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(288,406 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(393,677 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (expense) income - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,276 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(223,557 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(131 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income. Interest income of $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $10,000 or 36% from interest income of $27,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income primarily represents late fees from customers.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense of $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $394,000 or 137% from interest expense of $288,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to interest on higher borrowings under our term loans and the line of credit.\nOther Income (Expense) - net. Other expense - net was $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to other income - net of $170,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in other (expense) income are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily resulting from transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring measurement and settlement of such transactions.\nIncome Tax Provision. There was a $197,000 provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $59,000 compared to the provision for income taxes of $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, a $60,000 Federal income tax carryback claim was recorded which reduced total income tax expense. Included in the 2016 tax provision was a $174,000 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill. The pre-tax loss increased from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets of $7.2 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is (2%) and our Federal statutory tax rate is 34%. The primary reason for this difference pertains to the net operating loss incurred in the current year which could not be recorded as a benefit as the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, goodwill is tax deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax-deductibility of this indefinitely lived asset. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.\nDue to the fact that the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it is not netted against the Company's deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense.\nThe Company will maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. While our plan is to be profitable in the future and begin utilizing these deferred tax assets, there is not sufficient evidence to allow us to avoid the full valuation allowance in 2015 and 2016. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the timing and level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\n 46 \n \nThe Company has state NOL carry forwards of approximately $10.8 million which will expire at various dates from 2034 to 2036. The Company has a Federal NOL carry forward of approximately $10.6 million which will expire between 2034 and 2036. The use of some of the Federal NOL carry forward is subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a cash balance of $3.5 million at December 31, 2016, and an outstanding balance of $9.3 million drawn on its credit facility with Opus Bank, which was fully utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the Opus credit agreement. During March 2017 Opus amended the covenants whereby the asset coverage ratio covenant was removed. There is a provision for a minimum balance during the month, as well as the ability to go below the minimum as long as the balance recovers in 5 days. The new covenants also contain minimum revenue and adjusted EBITDA requirements. If we raise additional capital through a sale of equity, a portion of the net proceeds will be used to pay down the term loans. Additionally, on June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2017, the interest rate on the Opus debt increases in steps by a total of 3.5%, from prime plus 1.75% to prime plus 5.25%.\nIn October the Company made an initial $2 million payment toward the MediGain acquisition, which had a total purchase price of $7 million, the remaining $5 million of which is unsecured. On March 29, 2017 the Company received a letter from Prudential that demanded immediate payment of $3 million of the remaining consideration that is now due together with accrued interest, and expressing Prudential's intention to collect on said amounts. The balance is due at a later date. The Company will require additional financing in order to make these payments.\nThere were negative cash flows from operations of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as the Company integrated the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions. In 2016, there was $898,000 negative cash flow from operations as the Company integrated its 2016 Acquisitions, the largest of which was MediGain. Due to operating losses in 2015 and 2016, the Company relies on the term loans and line of credit to fund operations.\nThe Company's available cash will not be sufficient to meet its current and anticipated cash requirements without additional financing. According, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm reported that conditions existed that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial information throughout this Annual Report and the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and these financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement believes that it will be necessary to raise additional funding, which might be in the form of sales of additional shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, its common stock, or some other instrument. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete any financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we issue equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we issue debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, we may incur debt service obligations, and we may become subject to restrictions limiting our ability to operate our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to obtain financing when needed may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\n 47 \n \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years presented.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(897,842 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,882,781 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,833,482 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(602,423 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,503,006 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,900 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,562,682 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,990,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September 2015, the Company secured a $10 million credit facility from Opus Bank, including an initial $4 million term loan and a $2 million revolving line of credit. The proceeds of the term loan were used to fully repay the previous TD Bank line of credit and other notes payable. Additional term loans totaling $4 million from Opus were received in November 2015 and in March 2016.\nThe Company raised approximately $4.7 million of net proceeds from a public preferred stock offering in November 2015, and raised approximately $1.3 million of net proceeds from additional sales of the same preferred stock in July 2016.\nThe Company previously had a line of credit with TD Bank, which increased from $1.2 million to $3 million in March 2015, and was repaid in 2016 with proceeds from the Opus Bank term loan and closed.\nEffective December 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $500,000 stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company purchased 101,338 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $122,031. The plan ran through January 16, 2016.\nEffective January 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an additional $1,000,000 stock repurchase program. The program expired on January 25, 2017. Through December 31, 2016, the Company purchased an additional 644,565 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $546,145.\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $898,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the net loss of $4.1 million included the following changes in non-cash items: additional depreciation and amortization of $509,000, additional stock-based compensation of $1.2 million and decrease in change in contingent consideration of $1.1 million. Although revenue increased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, expenses increased by $5 million for the same period primarily due to the acquisition of MediGain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccounts receivable increased by $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a decrease of $520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a decrease of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.8 million, an increase of $3.2 million compared to $602,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in spending is primarily due to the initial payments of $1.25 million, $175,000 and $2 million for the GCB, RMB and MediGain acquisitions, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $157,000, compared to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash provided by financing activities in 2016 includes $2 million of additional term loan borrowings from Opus Bank before financing costs, offset by a $1.4 million repayment of debt obligations, $709,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000 of purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program. The cash provided by financing activities for 2015 represented borrowings on the Opus line of credit, net of repayments to TD Bank, $4.7 million from sale of preferred stock and $811,000 of repayment of debt obligations. Average borrowings from our revolving line of credit were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 48 \n \nOur line of credit with Opus Bank expires on September 1, 2018, unless renewed. As of December 31, 2016, $2 million was drawn on the line. Our term loans with Opus Bank mature on September 1, 2019 and require monthly principal payments which began October 1, 2016 of approximately $222,000 per month and continue through the end of the loan period.\nThe Company raised $4.7 million from the sale of preferred stock after expenses in 2015 and $1.3 million in 2016. During 2016 and 2015, $709,000 and $48,000 of preferred stock dividends were paid, respectively.\nIn connection with the common stock buy-back program, the Company purchased 101,338 and 644,565 of its shares for an aggregate cost of $122,000 and $546,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. No shares were repurchased subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations under our term loans, line of credit, and in connection with our purchase of MediGain and contingent consideration in connection with the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions. We were in compliance with all Opus covenants in 2016. We also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment.\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under our long-term contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of December 31, 2016. In addition, based on the obligations as of December 31, 2016, we expected interest expense to be approximately $600,000 during the years below. Based on the Opus amendment, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $800,000.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ending December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes and long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases for office space, computer equipment and other property, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nNasdaq Listing Compliance\nOn June 24, 2016, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5810(b), as the closing bid price of the Company's common stock has been below the minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTBC\u201d or of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTBCP.\u201d\n 49 \n \nIn accordance with Nasdaq's Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had an initial period of 180 days, or until December 21, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement, which requires the closing bid for the common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this period. The Company was eligible and received an additional 180 day compliance period. The Company has issued a special proxy to its shareholders asking for approval to authorize the Board of Directors to approve a reverse stock split which will increase the price per share. The special shareholders' meeting is scheduled for April 14, 2017. The Board of Directors will then have the authority to approve the amount of the reverse stock split which could range from 1 for 3 to 1 for 8, if they deem this to be in the Company's best interest. The Company's failure to regain compliance during this additional 180 days compliance period could result in delisting.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nMTBC is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) platform is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We employ a highly educated workforce of more than 1,700 people in Pakistan and 100 in Sri Lanka, where we believe labor costs are approximately one-half the cost of comparable India-based employees and one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees, thus enabling us to deliver our solutions at competitive prices.\nOur flagship offering, PracticePro, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use \u2018big practice solutions' to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:\n \u25cf Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; \u25cf Electronic health records (or EHR), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our customers to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; \u25cf Revenue cycle management (or RCM) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and \u25cf Mobile Health (or mHealth) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. \nAdoption of our solutions requires only a modest upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues is based on a percentage of our clients' collections. For new customers other than those obtained through acquisitions, the standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution averages approximately 5% of a practice's healthcare-related revenues plus a small one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry.\nAs a result of the SoftCare acquisition, the Company has a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. Also as a result of this acquisition, the Company has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to record, manage and control the exchange of information. As a result of the WFS acquisition, the Company has a printing and mailing operation.\nOur growth strategy involves two approaches: acquiring smaller RCM companies and then migrating the customers of those companies to our solutions, as well as partnering with EHR and other vendors that lack an integrated solution and integrating our solutions with their offerings. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure.\n 35 \nWe believe we will also be able to accelerate organic growth by partnering with industry participants, utilizing them as channel partners to offer integrated solutions to their customers. We have entered into arrangements with industry participants from which we began to derive revenue starting in mid-2014, including emerging EHR providers and other healthcare vendors that lack a full suite of solutions. We have developed application interfaces with several EHR systems, as well as providers of paper-based clinical forms to create integrated offerings, together with device and lab integration.\nOur Pakistan operations accounted for approximately 26% and 33% of total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of those expenses were personnel-related costs (approximately 75% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015). Because personnel-related costs are significantly lower in Pakistan than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our Pakistan operations give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the medical billing companies that we have acquired use domestic labor or subcontractors from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these labor costs to Pakistan.\nOn October 3, 2016, MTBC Acquisition, Corp. ( MAC\u201d), a newly formed, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTBC, acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of MediGain, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ( Millennium\u201d) (together MediGain\u201d). The assets, including accounts receivable, customer relationships, fixed assets and two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries of MediGain, located in India and Sri Lanka, were acquired through a strict foreclosure process whereby MAC acquired senior secured notes secured by the assets of MediGain, and immediately thereafter foreclosed on the assets in satisfaction of the senior secured notes. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $7 million. Of this amount, $2 million was paid at closing and the balance is due April 1, 2018.\nIn connection with this acquisition, MTBC expects to generate at least $10 million of annual revenue from the customers acquired. Although there is no assurance that the customers will remain with MTBC, the Company expects that this acquisition will be accretive to earnings during 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to integrate the acquired operations with MTBC, but will have offshore operations in Sri Lanka and India as well as Pakistan, and in the short term, we will have a significant number of additional U.S.-based employees from MediGain.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP.\u201d) Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\n \u25cf Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \u25cf Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on our debt; \u25cf Foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and asset impairment charges and other non-cash non-operating expenditures; \u25cf Stock-based compensation expense, including customer incentives paid in stock and related fees, and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price; \n 36 \n\nSet forth below is a presentation of our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per share exclude the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\n \u25cf Foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and asset impairment charges and other non-cash non-operating expenditures; \u25cf Stock-based compensation expense, including customer incentives paid in stock and related fees, and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price; \u25cf Amortization of purchased intangible assets; \u25cf Integration costs, such as severance amounts paid to employees from acquired businesses or transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements, and other costs related to specific transactions; \u25cf Changes in contingent consideration; and \u25cf Income tax expense resulting from the amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions. \nNo tax effect has been provided in computing non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share as the Company has sufficient carry forward losses to offset the applicable income taxes. The following table shows our reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted net income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n 37 \n\n\nFor purposes of determining non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, the Company used the number of common shares outstanding at the end of the years December 31, 2016 and 2015, including the shares which were issued but have not been settled, and considered contingent consideration, in order to provide insight into results considering the total number of shares which were issued at the time of the acquisitions. Accordingly, the end-of-period diluted common shares include 248,625 and 553,473 of contingently issuable shares at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No tax effect has been provided in computing non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per common share as the Company has sufficient carry forward losses to offset the applicable income taxes. The table below shows the composition of end-of-period common shares.\n\n 38 \nQuarterly Results of Operations\n\n 39 \nReconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to the line items in our consolidated financial statements, we regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess market share trends and working capital needs. We believe information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business.\nSet forth below are our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted for approximately 71% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 85% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFirst Pass Acceptance Rate: We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding. Clearinghouses are third parties that process the submission of claims to insurers and require compliance with insurance companies' formatting and other submission rules before submitting those claims. For the purposes of calculating first pass acceptance rate, consistent with industry practice, we exclude claims submitted under real-time adjudication procedures, which are procedures that allow a healthcare provider to determine, at the point of care, if a service they are rendering will be paid. Our first-time acceptance rate was approximately 96% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 95% for the year ended December 31, 2015, which compares favorably to the average of the top twelve payers of approximately 95%, as reported by the American Medical Association.\nFirst Pass Resolution Rate: First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 93% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDays in Accounts Receivable: Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients' median days in accounts receivable was approximately 33 days for primary care and 40 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2016, and approximately 35 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the national average of 40 days, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association, an association for professional administrators and leaders of medical group practices. Higher first pass resolution rates and effective follow-up helped us to achieve this rate, which reduces our customers' collection cycle of claims, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\n 40 \nCustomer Renewal Rate: Our customer renewal rate measures the percentage of our clients who were a party to a services agreement with us on January 1 of a particular year and continued to operate and be a client on December 31 of the same year. It also includes acquired accounts, if they are a party to a services agreement with the company we acquired and are generating revenue for us, so long as the risk of client loss under the respective purchase agreement has fully shifted to us by January 1 of the particular year. Our renewal rates for 2016 and 2015 were 85% and 79%, respectively. The renewal rates for our customers who are also users of our EHR for 2016 and 2015 were 97% and 99%, respectively. The percentage of our revenue we generated during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 which came from all users of our EHR was 39% and 45%, respectively.\nProviders and Practices Served: As of December 31, 2016, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 2,800 providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services), representing approximately 830 practices. In addition, we served approximately 250 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 1,500 providers representing approximately 730 practices.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue: We primarily derive our revenues from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes RCM as well as the ability to use our electronic health records and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These payments accounted for approximately 88% and 92% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. This includes customers utilizing our proprietary product suite, PracticePro, as well as customers from acquisitions which we are servicing utilizing third-party software. Key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers we are servicing, the number of patients served by those providers, and collections by those providers. We also generate revenues from one-time setup fees we charge for implementing PracticePro; the sale of our stand-alone web-based EHR solution, ChartsPro; and from transcription, coding, indexing and other ancillary services. Our plan is to move customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies wherever feasible without jeopardizing the client relationship. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we moved approximately 64% of the medical billing customers from the 2016, 2015 and 2014 Acquisitions to our operating platform.\nAs a result of the SoftCare acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we earned approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of our revenue from clearinghouse and EDI clients. As a result of the WFS acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we earned approximately 3% of our revenue from printing and mailing operations.\nOperating Expenses\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing costs, and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Pakistan operations accounted for approximately 33% and 44% of direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As we grow, we expect to achieve further economies of scale and to see our direct operating costs decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel, advertising expenses. These have been relatively low in the past (under 2% of our revenue through 2015), as we have often found it to be more economical to grow by the acquisition of other medical billing companies than by engaging in directed marketing efforts to prospective customers. However, in October 2016 we hired four sales and marketing personnel as part of MediGain acquisition. Going forward, we intend to invest in marketing, business development and sales resources to expand our market share, building on our existing customer base.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. Because we incorporate our technology into our services as soon as technological feasibility is established, most costs are currently expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in the future in absolute terms, but decrease as a percentage of revenue. Consistent with our growth plans, we are hiring developers, analysts and project managers in an effort to streamline our operational processes and further develop our products.\n 41 \nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. Our Pakistan office accounted for approximately 26% and 29% of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContingent Consideration. Contingent consideration represents the amount payable to the sellers of the Acquisitions based on the achievement of defined performance measures contained in the purchase agreements. For the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, the contingent consideration consists of amounts due in cash and for one of the sellers of the 2014 Acquisitions, amounts due in the Company's common stock. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\t\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. Depreciation for computers is calculated over three years, while remaining assets (except leasehold improvements) are depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the economic life of those assets.\nAmortization expense through the second quarter of 2015 was charged on a straight-line basis over a period of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, including customer contracts and relationships and covenants not to compete, as well as purchased software. We concluded that three years reflects the period during which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. For customer contracts and relationships relating to the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, amortization was charged using the double declining balance method over three years, as the Company concluded that the double declining balance method was more appropriate based on its historical experience as the majority of the cash flows are expected to be recognized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2016, our acquisitions and purchases of customer relationships added $4.8 million of intangibles. Amortization related to the 2016 Acquisitions was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, our acquisitions and purchase of customer relationships added $1,083,000 of intangibles. Amortization related to the 2015 Acquisitions and the purchase of the customer relationships was $422,000 and $212,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense). Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit, term loans and notes issued in connection with acquisitions, offset by interest income. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and amounted to a foreign exchange loss of $92,000 and a foreign exchange gain of $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Tax. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n 42 \nWe believe that the accounting policies below are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContingent consideration\nIf a business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. As a result of the Acquisitions, the Company adjusts the contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period based on fair value inputs representing changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock, changes in forecasted revenue of the acquired entities and the probability of an adjustment to the purchase price. Critical estimates include determining the forecasted revenue for certain acquisitions, probability and timing of cash collections and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date are included in earnings if the contingent consideration is recorded as a liability and are included in equity if the contingent consideration is recorded as an equity instrument.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 31st, referred to as the annual test date. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting-unit level. The Company has determined that its business consists of a single reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the use of a discount cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions and judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant's viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected client retention rates, expected future cash inflows and outflows and estimated useful lives of those intangible assets. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide an allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. If necessary, provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables. In determining the provision, we analyze our historical collection experience, the aging of our accounts receivable, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. We reassess this allowance each reporting period. If actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates, adjustments to this allowance may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations.\n 43 \n \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years shown.\n\nComparison of 2016 and 2015\n\nRevenue. Total revenue of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.4 million or 6% from revenue of $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7.3 million and $2.9 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, respectively, offset by attrition from customers obtained primarily from the 2014 Acquisitions. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $1.1 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2015 Acquisitions.\n\n 44 \n \nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating costs of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.8 million or 15% from direct operating costs of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The MediGain Acquisition increased salary costs by $1.7 million and $374,000 in the U.S. and offshore, respectively, and subcontractor costs by $750,000. Postage and delivery costs increased by $517,000 due to the acquisitions of WFS and MediGain. Salary and other direct operating costs in Pakistan decreased by $1.1 million or 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the reduction in the number of employees in Pakistan who were hired to service customers of the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions. Salary costs in the U.S. decreased by $1.3 million or 32% due to the reduction in the number of employees acquired from the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions due to the transition of customers to the MTBC platform, utilizing technology and offshore labor instead of U.S. personnel. This savings was partially offset by approximately $1 million of payroll expense related to employees obtain in connection with the 2016 Acquisitions other than MediGain. In addition, software platform costs increased by $245,000 and travel and entertainment costs increased by $399,000 from 2015 due to the 2016 acquisition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2016 salary and benefit costs for the subsidiary in Poland increased by $79,000.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $757,000 or 162% from selling and marketing expense of $467,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company hired additional sales and marketing personnel and transferred existing personnel into these positions as a step towards increasing revenue of the Company, and with the acquisition of MediGain, there was a further increase of $255,000 in salaries due to MediGain's established sales and marketing team.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $12.5 million increased by $490,000 or 4% from general and administrative expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additional expenses resulted primarily from the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions, including payroll, facilities and legal and professional costs. The MediGain acquisition increased salary cost by $1.1 million. Legal and professional costs increased by $331,000 or 26%, in part due to transaction costs related to the MediGain acquisition. These increases in costs were offset by decreases in other general and administrative costs. Salary expense in the U.S. decreased by $329,000 or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in the number of employees. Other general and administrative costs including occupancy expenses decreased by approximately $724,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense of $902,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $243,000 or 37% from research and development expense of $659,000 in the prior year, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan performing software development work.\nContingent Consideration. The change in contingent consideration of $715,000 and $1.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, relates to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. This gain resulted primarily from changes in the revenue estimates for the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions and also from a decrease in the price of the Company's common stock for the Practicare shares held in escrow. The settlement of the Omni shares and the forfeiture of all the shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of CastleRock contributed to the change for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation. Depreciation of $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $107,000 or 25% from depreciation of $420,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of additional property and equipment purchases and the MediGain Acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $402,000 or 10% from amortization expense of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase resulted from the intangible assets acquired in connection with our Acquisitions, which are primarily being amortized over three years.\n 45 \n \n\nInterest Income. Interest income of $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $10,000 or 36% from interest income of $27,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income primarily represents late fees from customers.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense of $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $394,000 or 137% from interest expense of $288,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to interest on higher borrowings under our term loans and the line of credit.\nOther Income (Expense) - net. Other expense - net was $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to other income - net of $170,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in other (expense) income are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily resulting from transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring measurement and settlement of such transactions.\nIncome Tax Provision. There was a $197,000 provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $59,000 compared to the provision for income taxes of $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, a $60,000 Federal income tax carryback claim was recorded which reduced total income tax expense. Included in the 2016 tax provision was a $174,000 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill. The pre-tax loss increased from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets of $7.2 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is (2%) and our Federal statutory tax rate is 34%. The primary reason for this difference pertains to the net operating loss incurred in the current year which could not be recorded as a benefit as the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, goodwill is tax deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax-deductibility of this indefinitely lived asset. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.\nDue to the fact that the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it is not netted against the Company's deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense.\nThe Company will maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. While our plan is to be profitable in the future and begin utilizing these deferred tax assets, there is not sufficient evidence to allow us to avoid the full valuation allowance in 2015 and 2016. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the timing and level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\n 46 \n \nThe Company has state NOL carry forwards of approximately $10.8 million which will expire at various dates from 2034 to 2036. The Company has a Federal NOL carry forward of approximately $10.6 million which will expire between 2034 and 2036. The use of some of the Federal NOL carry forward is subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a cash balance of $3.5 million at December 31, 2016, and an outstanding balance of $9.3 million drawn on its credit facility with Opus Bank, which was fully utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the Opus credit agreement. During March 2017 Opus amended the covenants whereby the asset coverage ratio covenant was removed. There is a provision for a minimum balance during the month, as well as the ability to go below the minimum as long as the balance recovers in 5 days. The new covenants also contain minimum revenue and adjusted EBITDA requirements. If we raise additional capital through a sale of equity, a portion of the net proceeds will be used to pay down the term loans. Additionally, on June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2017, the interest rate on the Opus debt increases in steps by a total of 3.5%, from prime plus 1.75% to prime plus 5.25%.\nIn October the Company made an initial $2 million payment toward the MediGain acquisition, which had a total purchase price of $7 million, the remaining $5 million of which is unsecured. On March 29, 2017 the Company received a letter from Prudential that demanded immediate payment of $3 million of the remaining consideration that is now due together with accrued interest, and expressing Prudential's intention to collect on said amounts. The balance is due at a later date. The Company will require additional financing in order to make these payments.\nThere were negative cash flows from operations of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as the Company integrated the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions. In 2016, there was $898,000 negative cash flow from operations as the Company integrated its 2016 Acquisitions, the largest of which was MediGain. Due to operating losses in 2015 and 2016, the Company relies on the term loans and line of credit to fund operations.\nThe Company's available cash will not be sufficient to meet its current and anticipated cash requirements without additional financing. According, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm reported that conditions existed that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial information throughout this Annual Report and the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and these financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement believes that it will be necessary to raise additional funding, which might be in the form of sales of additional shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, its common stock, or some other instrument. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete any financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we issue equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we issue debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, we may incur debt service obligations, and we may become subject to restrictions limiting our ability to operate our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to obtain financing when needed may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\n 47 \n \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years presented.\n\nIn September 2015, the Company secured a $10 million credit facility from Opus Bank, including an initial $4 million term loan and a $2 million revolving line of credit. The proceeds of the term loan were used to fully repay the previous TD Bank line of credit and other notes payable. Additional term loans totaling $4 million from Opus were received in November 2015 and in March 2016.\nThe Company raised approximately $4.7 million of net proceeds from a public preferred stock offering in November 2015, and raised approximately $1.3 million of net proceeds from additional sales of the same preferred stock in July 2016.\nThe Company previously had a line of credit with TD Bank, which increased from $1.2 million to $3 million in March 2015, and was repaid in 2016 with proceeds from the Opus Bank term loan and closed.\nEffective December 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $500,000 stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company purchased 101,338 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $122,031. The plan ran through January 16, 2016.\nEffective January 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an additional $1,000,000 stock repurchase program. The program expired on January 25, 2017. Through December 31, 2016, the Company purchased an additional 644,565 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $546,145.\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $898,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the net loss of $4.1 million included the following changes in non-cash items: additional depreciation and amortization of $509,000, additional stock-based compensation of $1.2 million and decrease in change in contingent consideration of $1.1 million. Although revenue increased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, expenses increased by $5 million for the same period primarily due to the acquisition of MediGain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccounts receivable increased by $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a decrease of $520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a decrease of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.8 million, an increase of $3.2 million compared to $602,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in spending is primarily due to the initial payments of $1.25 million, $175,000 and $2 million for the GCB, RMB and MediGain acquisitions, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $157,000, compared to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash provided by financing activities in 2016 includes $2 million of additional term loan borrowings from Opus Bank before financing costs, offset by a $1.4 million repayment of debt obligations, $709,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000 of purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program. The cash provided by financing activities for 2015 represented borrowings on the Opus line of credit, net of repayments to TD Bank, $4.7 million from sale of preferred stock and $811,000 of repayment of debt obligations. Average borrowings from our revolving line of credit were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 48 \n \nOur line of credit with Opus Bank expires on September 1, 2018, unless renewed. As of December 31, 2016, $2 million was drawn on the line. Our term loans with Opus Bank mature on September 1, 2019 and require monthly principal payments which began October 1, 2016 of approximately $222,000 per month and continue through the end of the loan period.\nThe Company raised $4.7 million from the sale of preferred stock after expenses in 2015 and $1.3 million in 2016. During 2016 and 2015, $709,000 and $48,000 of preferred stock dividends were paid, respectively.\nIn connection with the common stock buy-back program, the Company purchased 101,338 and 644,565 of its shares for an aggregate cost of $122,000 and $546,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. No shares were repurchased subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations under our term loans, line of credit, and in connection with our purchase of MediGain and contingent consideration in connection with the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions. We were in compliance with all Opus covenants in 2016. We also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment.\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under our long-term contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of December 31, 2016. In addition, based on the obligations as of December 31, 2016, we expected interest expense to be approximately $600,000 during the years below. Based on the Opus amendment, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $800,000.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases for office space, computer equipment and other property, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nNasdaq Listing Compliance\nOn June 24, 2016, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5810(b), as the closing bid price of the Company's common stock has been below the minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTBC\u201d or of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTBCP.\u201d\n 49 \n \nIn accordance with Nasdaq's Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had an initial period of 180 days, or until December 21, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement, which requires the closing bid for the common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this period. The Company was eligible and received an additional 180 day compliance period. The Company has issued a special proxy to its shareholders asking for approval to authorize the Board of Directors to approve a reverse stock split which will increase the price per share. The special shareholders' meeting is scheduled for April 14, 2017. The Board of Directors will then have the authority to approve the amount of the reverse stock split which could range from 1 for 3 to 1 for 8, if they deem this to be in the Company's best interest. The Company's failure to regain compliance during this additional 180 days compliance period could result in delisting.", "item_7_tables": "Table 64: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Non-cash

of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- MTBC is a healthcare IT company that provides software and services to healthcare providers. Its integrated platform aims to help customers increase revenue, streamline workflows, and make better decisions.\n\n- MTBC has over 1,700 employees in Pakistan and 100 in Sri Lanka which allows it to provide services at competitive prices. \n\n- The company generates most of its revenue from RCM services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected. It also generates revenue from one-time setup fees, its EHR solution, and other ancillary services. \n\nFinancial Highlights\n- Total revenue for 2016 was $24.5 million, up 6% from 2015. The increase was driven by acquisitions, offset by some customer attrition.\n\n- Operating expenses were $32.4 million in 2016, up 18% from 2015, primarily due to acquisitions. This led to an increased operating loss.\n\n- Net loss for 2016 was $8.8 million compared to $4.7 million in 2015. Contributing factors included higher operating expenses and interest costs.\n\n- As of December 31, 2016, MTBC had $3.5 million in cash but owed $9.3 million on its fully utilized credit facility. Its available cash will not cover anticipated cash needs without additional financing.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was negative $898,000 in 2016 compared to negative $1.9 million in 2015 as the company integrated acquisitions. More financing is needed to fund operations.\n\nDoes this help summarize the key points? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
