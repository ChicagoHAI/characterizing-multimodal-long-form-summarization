(referred to herein as CalAmp\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d, or us\u201d) is a telematics solutions pioneer leading transformation in a global connected economy. We help reinvent businesses and improve lives around the globe with technology solutions that streamline complex mobile Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) deployments through wireless connectivity solutions and derived data intelligence. Our software applications, scalable cloud services, and intelligent devices collect and assess business-critical data anywhere in the world from industrial machines, commercial and passenger vehicles, their drivers and contents. With our global network of LoJack licensees and a strong ecosystem of industry partnerships, we bring intelligence to the edge in the mobile connected economy to help drive business efficiencies. We are headquartered in Irvine, California but expanding into international markets with our telematics technology solutions.\nIn February 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited, which brings us strong brand awareness across the United Kingdom and extensive law enforcement relationships with an ability to help drive our expansion in Europe. In March 2019, we acquired Car Track, S.A. de C.V., which will leverage our full stack of telematics and SaaS solutions to expand product offerings to our substantial subscriber base.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions ( Synovia\u201d), a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. Combined with the recent acquisitions of TRACKER and Car Track, the Synovia acquisition expands our fleet management and vehicle safety services portfolio and accelerates our transformation to high-value subscription-based services.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: Telematics Systems and Software & Subscription Services.\nTelematics Systems\nOur Telematics Systems segment offers a series of advanced telematics and SVR products for the broader connected vehicle and emerging Internet of Machines marketplace, which enable customers to optimize their operations by collecting, monitoring and effectively reporting business-critical information and desired intelligence from high-value remote and mobile assets. Our telematics products include asset tracking units, mobile telematics devices, fixed and mobile wireless gateways, and routers. These wireless networking devices underpin a wide range of solutions, and are ideal for applications demanding secure, reliable and business-critical communications.\nSoftware & Subscription Services\nOur Software & Subscription Services segment offers cloud-based application enablement and telematics service platforms that facilitate integration of our own applications, as well as those of third parties, through open Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs\u201d) to deliver full-featured mobile IoT solutions to a wide range of customers and markets. Our scalable proprietary applications and other subscription services enable rapid and cost-effective development of high-value solutions for customers all around the globe.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nRevenues\nAs described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted the new standard effective March 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which we applied to all contracts.\nProducts. Our products revenues consist primarily of sales of our telematics and SVR products or wireless networking devices to large global companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises in the U.S. and internationally. Revenues from our products are reported net of sales returns and allowances, and incentives. The prices charged for telematics and SVR products are determined through negotiation with our customers as well as prevailing market conditions and are fixed and determinable upon shipment.\nProfessional Services. Our professional services provided to customers include project management, engineering services, installation services and an on-going early warning automated notification service. Revenues are typically distinct from other performance obligations and are recognized as the related services are performed.\nSoftware-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our SaaS-based subscriptions for our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other verticals provide our customers with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile or remote assets via our software applications. For our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other customers, we sell highly customized devices that only function with our SaaS technology. Generally, we defer the recognition of revenue for the customized products that only function with our application and are sold on an integrated basis. The deferred product revenue amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices, which are three years in the vehicle finance vertical and four years in the fleet management vertical. Revenues from subscription services are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the subscription.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues for products represent the cost of finished goods sold to our customers. These costs include raw materials, manufacturing overhead and labor costs, as well as customs and duties, license royalties, recycling fees, insurance and other costs that are included in the price that we negotiate and pay to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for the products. The cost of revenues also include charges related to excess and obsolete inventories and the cost of fulfilling product warranties.\nOur cost of revenues for application subscriptions and other services includes personnel costs and related benefits, consultants, software development activities, cellular network access costs, infrastructure costs for use of private networking services, and other costs that are required to deliver these services to our customers. Our cost of revenues for application subscriptions and other services also includes cost of customized devices that only function with our applications and are sold on an integrated basis with applicable subscriptions. The costs are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices. The estimated average in-service lives are three years in the vehicle finances and four years in the fleet management verticals.\nWe continually negotiate to reduce the cost we pay to our suppliers in order to maintain consistent low prices for our customers. We accomplish this by working with our suppliers to find alternative, less expensive sources of raw materials and components as well as eliminating excess costs throughout our supply chain.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, or gross margin, is influenced by several factors including sales volume, product and service mix, and changes in product costs. We expect gross margin to fluctuate over time based on how we control the mix of product and services and manage our inventory using sales incentives granted to our customers. Additionally, although we primarily procure and sell our products in U.S. dollars, we are susceptible to exchange rate fluctuations with other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably this may have an impact on our future selling prices and unit costs. Gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate over time based on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, including salaries and bonuses, fringe benefits and stock-based compensation as well as the cost of professional services, information technology, facilities and other administrative expenses. We classify our operating expenses into the following four categories:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Research and development expense consists of personnel related costs, professional services, certification fees and software licenses incurred to support our existing install-base of telematics devices through our field application engineers, software developers, program and product managers, as well as our effort to develop new products and technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Selling and marketing expense consists of personnel related costs including our incentive programs to support our global sales organization as well as advertising and marketing promotions of our brand and products, including media advertisement costs, merchandising and display costs, trade show and event costs, and sponsorship costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> General and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs to support our global enterprise as well as outside services for legal, accounting, insurance, information technology, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Restructuring expense consists of personnel and facility related costs resulting from our cost savings initiative commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Personnel costs represent severance and employee related costs, and facility charges represent expenses for vacant office and manufacturing facility space under Corporate Expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Intangible asset amortization is attributable to our acquired identifiable intangible assets from business combinations. Our acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized from the date of acquisition over periods ranging from two to ten years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our operating costs will increase in absolute dollars due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as expansion into new geographic regions. Operating expense may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues throughout the year due to discrete quarterly events and seasonal trends.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nNon-operating income (expense) consists of (i) investment and interest income earned on our cash balances and investments, (ii) interest expense on our convertible senior unsecured notes including the amortization of note discount and debt issue costs, (iii) the gain on a legal settlement, (iv) the loss from extinguishment of debt and (v) other income (expense) that includes but is not limited to transaction gains and losses and foreign currency gains and losses. We recognize the gain on legal settlement on a cash basis due to the lack of certainty of collection as we received the settlement payments from a former LoJack supplier, which is further explained in Note 19 - Legal Proceedings\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Loss from extinguishment of debt is further explained in Note 10 - Financing Arrangements\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and related states as well as foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Our effective tax rate will approximate the U.S. statutory income tax rate plus the apportionment of state income taxes coupled with our foreign statutory rate based on the portion of taxable income allocable to each tax jurisdiction.\nImpairment Loss and Equity in Net Loss of Affiliate\nWe have an investment in a technology and insurance startup company called Smart Driver Club Limited, which represents a minority ownership interest that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting since we have significant influence over the investee. As a result, we record our portion of the losses incurred by this entity and impairment charges related to these investments as equity in net loss of affiliate.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the statements of comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets or statements of cash flows. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Earnings Before Investment Income, Interest Expenses, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, non-cash costs and expenses arising from purchase accounting adjustments, litigation provision, gain from legal settlement and certain other adjustments. Our CEO, the CODM, uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and monitor\nsegment performance. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison to help investors evaluate our results of ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Pursuant to the rule and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and reconciliation to net income (loss).\nOPERATING

The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced sales of our MRM telematics and legacy LoJack SVR products and partially offset by increased demand in OEM products. During the fiscal year, we initiated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. In connection with this program, we experienced various operational challenges and extended lead times on certain components thereby impacting our ability to delivery on customer orders for MRM telematics products. Additionally, our legacy LoJack SVR revenue continued its secular decline due to a technology transition from proprietary radio frequency technology to GPS-based telematics solutions. This decline is expected to be offset by future growth in our telematics solutions, such as SureDrive and LotSmart, over time. OEM products sales increased as demand from our customers, including our top customer, increased due to more favorable conditions in the heavy equipment markets.\nSoftware & Subscription Services revenue increased by $12.6 million or 19.8% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to growth driven by our fleet management and LoJack subscription services.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 363,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 365,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 216,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased by $3.1 million or 2.1% over the prior year due to lower revenue in our Telematics Systems business.

Consolidated research and development expense as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.6% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to 7.0% in the same period last year. We are investing in research and development of new products and technologies to be sold through the U.S. and international sales channels.\nConsolidated selling and marketing expense decreased by $0.2 million or 0.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in professional services and web design costs, as we substantially completed our CalAmp and LoJack brand refresh initiatives during the prior fiscal year. The decrease was partially offset by increases in marketing expenses to support various business developments in international territories.\nConsolidated general and administrative expense decreased by $21.0 million or 40.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in litigation provisions and expenses related to existing legal matters (see Note 19). The decrease was partially offset by increased professional services coupled with service fees related to a new cloud-based ERP system that we are implementing to support the growth in our global operations. Certain implementation costs on the new ERP system were capitalized as Property and Equipment in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2018, we commenced a plan to capture certain synergies and cost savings related to streamlining our global operations and sales organization as well as rationalize certain leased properties that are partially vacant. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, we recorded approximately $4.3 million in severance and employee related costs as well as $3.7 million in rent and related costs associated with office and manufacturing plant facilities where we have ceased use.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by $3.6 million or 23.7% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year due to completion of amortization on certain intangible assets.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net\nInvestment income increased by $3.0 million to $5.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 from $2.3 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income resulting from increased investments in various cash equivalent and short-term marketable securities primarily as a result of the net proceeds from our 2025 Convertible Notes and operating cash flows.\nInterest expense increased $6.4 million to $16.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 from $10.3 million for the same period last year due to additional interest expense and debt discount and issue costs relating to the 2025 Convertible Notes issued in July 2018 that are being amortized on the effective interest method.\nSee Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning the $18.3 million gain on the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on the $2.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nOther non-operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 increased $1.1 million from net non-operating expense for the same period last year due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Euros to U.S. dollars.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nAn income tax benefit of $1.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2019, compared to an income tax expense of $10.7 million in fiscal 2018. The change in the income tax expense (benefit) compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the $9.0 million provisional tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recorded in fiscal 2018 and a decrease in our valuation allowances against non-US deferred tax assets in the amount of $4.4 million. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProfitability Measures\nNet Income:\nOur net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 was $18.4 million as compared to net income of $16.6 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to a $11.7 million increase in operating income, $3.0 million increase in investment income and $12.0 million decrease in income tax provision. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $21.0 million decrease in general and administrative expense due to reduced legal provision and related costs as further discussed in Note 19 and partially offset by $8.0 million of restructuring expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telematics Systems\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software & Subscription Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,699\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,794\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (905\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,167\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased $8.1 million compared to the same period last year due to lower revenues as described above and the impact of high margin revenue earned on a strategic technology partnership arrangement in fiscal 2018. These factors were coupled with higher operating expenses in Telematics Systems as a result of increased headcount and outsourced professional service fees. Adjusted EBITDA for Software and Subscription Services increased $4.9 million compared to the same period last year due primarily to continued growth in revenues and gross profit from our Italia market and higher gross profit from our fleet management services.\nSee Note 20 for reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and a reconciliation to GAAP-basis net income (loss).\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended February 28, 2017:\nRevenue by Segment\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telematics Systems\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 302,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software & Subscription Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,069\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 365,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 351,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTelematics Systems revenue increased by $27.8 million or 10.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to an increase in sales volume for our MRM telematics products and OEM products as demand from our top customers increased due to more favorable conditions in the fleet management, asset tracking and heavy equipment markets. The increase in units sold in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of our products during the year.\nSoftware & Subscription Services revenue increased by $2.1 million or 3.3% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to growth in our Italian operations along with a more favorable Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate compared to the same period last year.\nSatellite revenue decreased by $15.1 million or 100% as this business ceased to exist in fiscal 2017.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 365,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 351,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 207,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased by $7.5 million or 5.3% over the prior year.

Consolidated research and development expense as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.0% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. We are investing in research and development of software applications and products technologies to be sold through the U.S. and international sales channels.\nConsolidated selling and marketing expense increased by $1.1 million or 2.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year.

The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in legal expenses related to a patent infringement lawsuit.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by $0.1 million or 0.5% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year due to completion of amortization on certain older intangible assets.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net\nInvestment income increased by $0.6 million to $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 from $1.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to an increase in investment income on Rabbi Trust assets that serve to informally fund our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and an increase in dividend income from a minority owned international licensee.\nInterest expense increased $0.4 million to $10.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 from $9.9 million for the same period last year due to increased amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with the convertible notes issued in May 2015.\nSee Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the $28.3 million gain on the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack.\nOther non-operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.5 million from net non-operating expense for the same period last year due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Euros to U.S. dollars.\nProfitability Measures\nNet income:\nThe net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 was $16.6 million as compared to a net loss of $7.9 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily the result of the $28.3 million non-operating gain from the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack, which was recognized during fiscal 2018. This gain was partially offset by higher tax expense in fiscal 2018 due to U.S. and foreign taxes on the $28.3 million legal settlement gain as well as the revaluation of our net deferred income tax assets that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as we adopted the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telematics Systems\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software & Subscription Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,794\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,586\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,208\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased $1.5 million compared to the same period last year due to higher MRM products revenue.

We have historically funded our principal business activities through cash flows generated from operations. As we continue to grow our customer base and increase our revenues, there will be a need for working capital in the future. Our immediate sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and our revolving credit facility. As of February 28, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $274.0 million.\nOn March 30, 2018, we entered into a revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that provides for borrowings of up to $50 million. This revolving credit facility expires on March 30, 2020. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at either a Prime or LIBOR-based variable rate as selected by us on a periodic basis. This revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum level of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other noncash charges (EBITDA) and minimum debt coverage ratios. Throughout fiscal 2019 and as of February 28, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility.\nHistorically, we have used funding from external sources to finance general corporate expenditures and other strategic initiatives including acquisitions and share repurchases. In May 2015, we issued $172.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior notes which are due in May 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2020 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election. We intend to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and we believe that we will have adequate cash available to repay the notes by its maturity date. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Convertible Notes to fund the acquisition of LoJack as well as a stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2016. The acquisition of LoJack resulted in us funding a purchase price of approximately $122 million, net of cash acquired. The stock repurchase program resulted in us repurchasing 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock from June 2016 through January 2017 at an average cost of $14.20 per share, which accounts for the cash outflow of $25 million in fiscal 2017.\nOn July 20, 2018, we issued 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, (the 2025 Convertible Notes\u201d), with a principal amount of $230.0 million. The net proceeds from our sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes were $222.7 million, net of issuance costs of $7.3 million. We used approximately $90.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay (i) the cost of the capped call transactions of $21.2 million; (ii) repurchase shares of our common stock of approximately $15.0 million, and (iii) repurchase principal of our outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for approximately $53.8 million including accrued interest. As part of the repurchase of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we also unwound the related note hedges and warrants, which provided us proceeds of $3.1 million. We expect to use the remainder of the proceeds from the 2025 Convertible Notes for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include but not limited to, additional repurchases of the 2020 Convertible Notes, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We also intend to settle the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion and we believe that we will have adequate cash available to repay the notes by the maturity date.\nAs described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in February 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited, a LoJack licensee, which was funded from our cash on hand. The total purchase price was \u00a310.0 million, or approximately $13.0 million. In the same month, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Car Track, S.A. DE C.V., the exclusive licensee of LoJack technology for the Mexican market. The agreement was to purchase the 87.5% of the Car Track shares not currently owned by us for a purchase price, net of cash on hand, of approximately $13.0 million. We completed the acquisition in March 2019. In April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions, a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. The total purchase price was approximately $50 million.\nWe are a defendant in various legal proceedings involving intellectual property claims and contract disputes matters whereby the final settlement has not been determined at this time. In connection with these matters, we may have to enter into license agreements or other settlement arrangements that could require us to make significant payments in the future. Based on current information available, we do not believe that there are any claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings.\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, intangible asset amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of convertible debt issue costs and discount, deferred income taxes and other investment related matters as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nOur cash flow from operating activities are attributable to our net income as well as how well we manage our working capital, which is dictated by the volume of product we purchase from our manufacturers or suppliers and then sell to our customers along with the payment and collection terms that we negotiate with them. We purchase a majority of our product from significant suppliers located in Asia that generally provide us 60 day payment terms for products purchased. Our significant customers are located in the U.S. as well as certain international locations. We believe that our relationship with our customers is very good and that these customers are in good financial condition. We generally grant credit to our customers based on their financial viability and our historical collection experience with them. We typically require payment from them within 30 to 45 days of our invoice date. Since we are paying our suppliers at or within 60 days of inventory purchase and our payment terms on our accounts receivable are within 45 days, we have historically generated positive cash flows from operating activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.7 million. Net income was $18.4 million which benefited by a $18.3 million gain from a legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack that was realized as non-operating income during the fiscal year. Our non-cash expenses, comprised principally of depreciation, intangible assets amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of convertible debt issue costs and discount, deferred income taxes and impairment loss and equity in net loss of affiliate was a $51.3 million source of cash in fiscal 2019. Changes in operating assets and liabilities represented a $22.3 million usage of cash, primarily driven by changes in working capital including a decrease in accrued liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable but partially offset by a decrease in inventory and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue.\nFor the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $66.9 million and $25.8 million, respectively. Our cash flows from operations were impacted by our net income (loss) of $16.6 million and $(7.9) million, respectively, as well as similar activities within other non-cash items and changes in working capital as noted above.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash used in investing activities was $21.8 million, $26.5 million, and $45.6 million, respectively. In each of these periods, our primary investing activities consisted of the purchase and sale of marketable securities in accordance with our corporate investment policy as well as strategic initiatives including certain investments in and advances to our affiliate and acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of TRACKER for approximately $13.0 million, and in fiscal 2017, we completed the acquisition of LoJack for approximately $117.0 million, net of cash acquired.\nOur investing activities include capital expenditures to support our increased employee headcount and overall growth in our business. We expect that we will make additional capital expenditures in the future, including the further build-out of our corporate offices and IT infrastructure, all of which will be done to support the future growth of our business.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $98.5 million, $(2.3) million and $(25.8) million, respectively. In each of these periods, we incurred payments for taxes related to the net share settlement of vested equity awards and the proceeds for the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2019, we issued $230.0 million of the 2025 Convertible Notes and used the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions; repurchase shares of our common stock for $49 million, and repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes as discussed above for $53.7 million. We also received proceeds of $3.1 million from the unwinding of the note hedges and warrants related to the 2020 Convertible Notes.\nOn May 7, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $30.0 million of our outstanding common stock. On July 16, 2018, our Board of Directors increased it to $39.0 million. As of February 28, 2019, the entire $39.0 million authorized by our Board of Directors had been utilized.\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock over the next 12 months. As of February 28, 2019, $10.0 million has been utilized.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds anticipated to be generated from our operations and available borrowing on our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the timing and extent of spending on various business initiatives, our international expansion, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nFollowing is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of February 28, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Future Estimated Cash Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> > 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 352,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes stated interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 464,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amount we report as assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analytical framework for transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In order to adhere to this core principle, we apply the following five-step approach:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> identify the contract with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> determine the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for goods or services we transfer to the customer.\nThe two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. We adopted the new standard effective March 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which we applied to all contracts that were not completed on adoption date. We applied the provisions of ASC 605 to revenue recognized during each of the fiscal years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017. In the section titled Recently Issued Accounting Standards below, we have presented a comparison of the results under ASC 606 and ASC 605 for the year ended February 28, 2019.\nProducts. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price, which is generally the stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods. For product shipments made on the basis of FOB Destination\u201d terms, revenue is recorded when the products reach the customer. Customers generally do not have a right of return except for defective products returned during the warranty period. We record estimated commitments related to customer incentive programs as reductions of revenues.\nProfessional Services. We also provide various professional services to customers. These include project management, engineering services, installation services and an on-going early warning automated notification service, which are typically distinct from other performance obligations and are recognized as the related services are performed. For certain professional service contracts, we recognize revenue based on the proportion of total costs incurred to-date over the estimated cost of the contract, which is an input method.\nSoftware-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our SaaS-based subscriptions for our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other verticals provide our customers with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile or remote assets via our software applications. The transaction price for a typical SaaS arrangement includes the price for the hardware, accessories, installation and application subscriptions. Generally, we defer the recognition of revenue for the customized devices that only function with our applications and are sold on an integrated basis with applicable subscriptions. Such customized devices and the application services are not sold separately. In such circumstances, the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs in the balance sheet. The upfront fees for the devices are not distinct from the subscription service and are combined into the subscription service performance obligation. Generally, these service arrangements do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the subscription service at any time. Revenues from subscription services are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the subscription. Subscription renewal fees are recognized ratably over the term of the renewal. The deferred product revenue and deferred product cost amounts are amortized to Application Subscriptions and Related Products and Other Services revenue and cost of revenue, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices, which are three years in the vehicle finance and four years in the fleet management verticals. Our deferred contract revenue under ASC 606 does not include future subscription fees associated with customers' unexercised contract renewal rights.\nIn certain customer arrangements, we also sell devices together with monitoring services, for which revenues for the sales of the devices are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer and monitoring services are recognized over the service period as the devices and services are customarily part of one customer contractual arrangement. The allocation of the transaction price is based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices for the devices and the monitoring services. The revenues under these arrangements are included within Application Subscription and Related Products and Other Services revenues and costs of revenues in our statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nSales taxes. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer.\nContract Balances. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing on our invoicing to customers. Contract liabilities are comprised of billings or payments received from our customers in advance of performance under the contract. We refer to these contract liabilities as Deferred Revenues\u201d in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer consist of deferred costs of hardware and sales commissions. The deferred costs of hardware are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the device on a straight-line basis. We determined that sales commissions are generally recognized within one year. Therefore, we have elected the practical expedient to expense sales commission costs as incurred.\nWe adopted ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method on March 1, 2018, and therefore we did not present comparative information for the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consists of amounts due from sales arrangements executed in our normal business activities and are recorded at invoiced amounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for uncollectible receivables. We determine the sufficiency of the accounts receivable allowance based upon historical experience and an evaluation of current industry trends and economic conditions. If our actual collection experience varies significantly from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts. Historical variances of these amounts from our estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our financial statements.\nInventories\nWe evaluate the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices. To the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values, inventory carrying amounts are written down. In addition, we generally treat inventory on hand or committed with suppliers, that is not expected to be sold in the near term, as excess and thus appropriate write-downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of revenues. Estimated usage in the next 12 months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management's estimate of sales beyond existing backlog, giving consideration to customers' forecasted demand, ordering patterns and product life cycles. A large portion of our inventory was purchased within the last two years, which we believe mitigates our exposure to material excess or obsolescence at this time, although ongoing changes in cellular carrier technology, supplier changes, closure of our warehouse facilities, changes in demand or significant reductions in product pricing may necessitate additional write-downs of inventory carrying value in the future, which could be material.\nProduct Warranty\nOur products generally have a one- or two-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects and workmanship. We estimate the future costs relating to product returns subject to our warranty and record a reserve upon shipment of our products. We periodically adjust our estimates for actual warranty claims, historical claims experience as well as the impact of the known product operational issues.\nWhile we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation can be affected by product, material and workmanship failures which may be outside of our control. If the actual factors leading to a product failure differ from management's assumptions, revisions to our estimated product warranty provision would be required and recorded to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) at the time of the change in estimate.\nPatent Litigation and Other Contingencies\nWe operate in an industry where there may be certain claims made against us related to patent infringement and other matters. We accrue for these claims whenever we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the liability is reasonably estimable. The amount of the accrual is estimated based on our review of each individual claim, including the type and facts of the claim and our assessment of the merits of the claim. Since these legal matters can be very complex and require significant judgement, we often utilize external legal counsel and other subject matter experts to assist us in defending against such claims. These accruals are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis and are adjusted to reflect the impact of recent negotiations, settlements, court rulings, advice from legal counsel and other events pertaining to the case. Although we believe that we take reasonable and considerable measures to mitigate our exposure in these matters, the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable. Nonetheless, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to pending legal matters against us as well as adequate provisions for probable and estimable losses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method when accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect\non deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Valuation allowances are provided against tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. In assessing valuation allowances, we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors, including cumulative earnings experience, expectations of future taxable income by jurisdiction, and the carryforward periods available for income tax purposes. We make estimates, assumptions and judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. In relation to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, allowed companies to record provisional amounts related to the tax effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act in 2018, and no material adjustments were required to the provisional amounts initially recorded on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the aggregate fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and labilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. We determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information, including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and other estimates made by management. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date impacting the asset valuations and liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, these estimates are uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, the impact of any subsequent adjustments is included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nGoodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt February 28, 2019, we had $80.8 million in goodwill and $47.2 million in other net intangible assets, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and consists primarily of goodwill from the LoJack acquisitions. Goodwill has been allocated to each of our two operating segments, which also represent our reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized but we perform an annual qualitative assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or at other reporting periods within the fiscal year as may be required, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in our stock price, significant differences in our forecasts compared to actual results, changes in our business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If further testing is required, we perform a two-step process. The first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the purpose of impairment testing, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units to be higher than the book value as of February 28, 2019. As a result, we have determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill for all periods presented.\nAcquired intangible assets with definite lives consist primarily of asset acquired in the LoJack acquisition, including tradenames, dealer relationships and developed technology and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products, technologies or relationships. We review our definite lived long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the lowest level of asset group is expected to generate. Given the interdependencies of revenues across our segments, product and service verticals and geographies, our asset groups are generally our two operating segments. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. There has been no impairment of long-lived assets for any periods presented.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nWe assess whether there are indicators that the value of our equity method investments may be impaired. An impairment charge is recognized only if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below our carrying value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of impairment is highly subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about our intent and ability to recover our investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment, including the level of our involvement therein, among other factors. To the extent an impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Impairment losses are included in Impairment loss and equity in net loss affiliate.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nOur stock-based compensation expense results from grants of employee and non-employee equity awards and is recognized in our consolidated financial statements based on the respective grant date fair values of the awards. The measurement of stock-based compensation expense is based on several criteria, including the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate. We recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis for our graded-vesting awards. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. However, the cumulative compensation expense recognized at any point in time must at least equal the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If any of these assumptions used in the valuation model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards could differ materially from the previously granted equity awards.\nForward Looking Statements\nForward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions, projections and other information regarding future performance, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With our global network of LoJack licensees and a strong ecosystem of industry partnerships, we bring intelligence to the edge in the mobile connected economy to help drive business efficiencies. We are headquartered in Irvine, California but expanding into international markets with our telematics technology solutions.\nIn February 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited, which brings us strong brand awareness across the United Kingdom and extensive law enforcement relationships with an ability to help drive our expansion in Europe. In March 2019, we acquired Car Track, S.A. de C.V., which will leverage our full stack of telematics and SaaS solutions to expand product offerings to our substantial subscriber base.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions ( Synovia\u201d), a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. Combined with the recent acquisitions of TRACKER and Car Track, the Synovia acquisition expands our fleet management and vehicle safety services portfolio and accelerates our transformation to high-value subscription-based services.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: Telematics Systems and Software & Subscription Services.\nTelematics Systems\nOur Telematics Systems segment offers a series of advanced telematics and SVR products for the broader connected vehicle and emerging Internet of Machines marketplace, which enable customers to optimize their operations by collecting, monitoring and effectively reporting business-critical information and desired intelligence from high-value remote and mobile assets. Our telematics products include asset tracking units, mobile telematics devices, fixed and mobile wireless gateways, and routers.

Our scalable proprietary applications and other subscription services enable rapid and cost-effective development of high-value solutions for customers all around the globe.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nRevenues\nAs described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted the new standard effective March 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which we applied to all contracts.\nProducts. Our products revenues consist primarily of sales of our telematics and SVR products or wireless networking devices to large global companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises in the U.S. and internationally. Revenues from our products are reported net of sales returns and allowances, and incentives. The prices charged for telematics and SVR products are determined through negotiation with our customers as well as prevailing market conditions and are fixed and determinable upon shipment.\nProfessional Services. Our professional services provided to customers include project management, engineering services, installation services and an on-going early warning automated notification service. Revenues are typically distinct from other performance obligations and are recognized as the related services are performed.\nSoftware-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our SaaS-based subscriptions for our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other verticals provide our customers with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile or remote assets via our software applications. For our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other customers, we sell highly customized devices that only function with our SaaS technology. Generally, we defer the recognition of revenue for the customized products that only function with our application and are sold on an integrated basis. The deferred product revenue amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices, which are three years in the vehicle finance vertical and four years in the fleet management vertical. Revenues from subscription services are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the subscription.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues for products represent the cost of finished goods sold to our customers. These costs include raw materials, manufacturing overhead and labor costs, as well as customs and duties, license royalties, recycling fees, insurance and other costs that are included in the price that we negotiate and pay to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for the products. The cost of revenues also include charges related to excess and obsolete inventories and the cost of fulfilling product warranties.\nOur cost of revenues for application subscriptions and other services includes personnel costs and related benefits, consultants, software development activities, cellular network access costs, infrastructure costs for use of private networking services, and other costs that are required to deliver these services to our customers. Our cost of revenues for application subscriptions and other services also includes cost of customized devices that only function with our applications and are sold on an integrated basis with applicable subscriptions. The costs are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices. The estimated average in-service lives are three years in the vehicle finances and four years in the fleet management verticals.\nWe continually negotiate to reduce the cost we pay to our suppliers in order to maintain consistent low prices for our customers. We accomplish this by working with our suppliers to find alternative, less expensive sources of raw materials and components as well as eliminating excess costs throughout our supply chain.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, or gross margin, is influenced by several factors including sales volume, product and service mix, and changes in product costs. We expect gross margin to fluctuate over time based on how we control the mix of product and services and manage our inventory using sales incentives granted to our customers. Additionally, although we primarily procure and sell our products in U.S. dollars, we are susceptible to exchange rate fluctuations with other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably this may have an impact on our future selling prices and unit costs. Gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate over time based on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, including salaries and bonuses, fringe benefits and stock-based compensation as well as the cost of professional services, information technology, facilities and other administrative expenses. We classify our operating expenses into the following four categories:\n \u2022 Research and development expense consists of personnel related costs, professional services, certification fees and software licenses incurred to support our existing install-base of telematics devices through our field application engineers, software developers, program and product managers, as well as our effort to develop new products and technologies. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing expense consists of personnel related costs including our incentive programs to support our global sales organization as well as advertising and marketing promotions of our brand and products, including media advertisement costs, merchandising and display costs, trade show and event costs, and sponsorship costs. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs to support our global enterprise as well as outside services for legal, accounting, insurance, information technology, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company. \n \u2022 Restructuring expense consists of personnel and facility related costs resulting from our cost savings initiative commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Personnel costs represent severance and employee related costs, and facility charges represent expenses for vacant office and manufacturing facility space under Corporate Expenses. \n \u2022 Intangible asset amortization is attributable to our acquired identifiable intangible assets from business combinations. Our acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized from the date of acquisition over periods ranging from two to ten years. \nWe expect our operating costs will increase in absolute dollars due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as expansion into new geographic regions. Operating expense may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues throughout the year due to discrete quarterly events and seasonal trends.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nNon-operating income (expense) consists of (i) investment and interest income earned on our cash balances and investments, (ii) interest expense on our convertible senior unsecured notes including the amortization of note discount and debt issue costs, (iii) the gain on a legal settlement, (iv) the loss from extinguishment of debt and (v) other income (expense) that includes but is not limited to transaction gains and losses and foreign currency gains and losses. We recognize the gain on legal settlement on a cash basis due to the lack of certainty of collection as we received the settlement payments from a former LoJack supplier, which is further explained in Note 19 - Legal Proceedings\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Loss from extinguishment of debt is further explained in Note 10 - Financing Arrangements\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and related states as well as foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Our effective tax rate will approximate the U.S. statutory income tax rate plus the apportionment of state income taxes coupled with our foreign statutory rate based on the portion of taxable income allocable to each tax jurisdiction.\nImpairment Loss and Equity in Net Loss of Affiliate\nWe have an investment in a technology and insurance startup company called Smart Driver Club Limited, which represents a minority ownership interest that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting since we have significant influence over the investee. As a result, we record our portion of the losses incurred by this entity and impairment charges related to these investments as equity in net loss of affiliate.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the statements of comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets or statements of cash flows. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Earnings Before Investment Income, Interest Expenses, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, non-cash costs and expenses arising from purchase accounting adjustments, litigation provision, gain from legal settlement and certain other adjustments. Our CEO, the CODM, uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and monitor\nsegment performance. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison to help investors evaluate our results of ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Pursuant to the rule and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and reconciliation to net income (loss).\nOPERATING

The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced sales of our MRM telematics and legacy LoJack SVR products and partially offset by increased demand in OEM products. During the fiscal year, we initiated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. In connection with this program, we experienced various operational challenges and extended lead times on certain components thereby impacting our ability to delivery on customer orders for MRM telematics products. Additionally, our legacy LoJack SVR revenue continued its secular decline due to a technology transition from proprietary radio frequency technology to GPS-based telematics solutions. This decline is expected to be offset by future growth in our telematics solutions, such as SureDrive and LotSmart, over time. OEM products sales increased as demand from our customers, including our top customer, increased due to more favorable conditions in the heavy equipment markets.\nSoftware & Subscription Services revenue increased by $12.6 million or 19.8% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to growth driven by our fleet management and LoJack subscription services.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 363,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 365,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 216,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased by $3.1 million or 2.1% over the prior year due to lower revenue in our Telematics Systems business.

The increase was primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits due to increased headcount. Consolidated research and development expense as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.6% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to 7.0% in the same period last year. We are investing in research and development of new products and technologies to be sold through the U.S. and international sales channels.\nConsolidated selling and marketing expense decreased by $0.2 million or 0.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in professional services and web design costs, as we substantially completed our CalAmp and LoJack brand refresh initiatives during the prior fiscal year. The decrease was partially offset by increases in marketing expenses to support various business developments in international territories.\nConsolidated general and administrative expense decreased by $21.0 million or 40.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in litigation provisions and expenses related to existing legal matters (see Note 19). The decrease was partially offset by increased professional services coupled with service fees related to a new cloud-based ERP system that we are implementing to support the growth in our global operations. Certain implementation costs on the new ERP system were capitalized as Property and Equipment in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2018, we commenced a plan to capture certain synergies and cost savings related to streamlining our global operations and sales organization as well as rationalize certain leased properties that are partially vacant. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, we recorded approximately $4.3 million in severance and employee related costs as well as $3.7 million in rent and related costs associated with office and manufacturing plant facilities where we have ceased use.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by $3.6 million or 23.7% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year due to completion of amortization on certain intangible assets.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net\nInvestment income increased by $3.0 million to $5.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 from $2.3 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income resulting from increased investments in various cash equivalent and short-term marketable securities primarily as a result of the net proceeds from our 2025 Convertible Notes and operating cash flows.\nInterest expense increased $6.4 million to $16.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 from $10.3 million for the same period last year due to additional interest expense and debt discount and issue costs relating to the 2025 Convertible Notes issued in July 2018 that are being amortized on the effective interest method.\nSee Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning the $18.3 million gain on the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on the $2.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nOther non-operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 increased $1.1 million from net non-operating expense for the same period last year due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Euros to U.S. dollars.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nAn income tax benefit of $1.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2019, compared to an income tax expense of $10.7 million in fiscal 2018. The change in the income tax expense (benefit) compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the $9.0 million provisional tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recorded in fiscal 2018 and a decrease in our valuation allowances against non-US deferred tax assets in the amount of $4.4 million. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProfitability Measures\nNet Income:\nOur net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 was $18.4 million as compared to net income of $16.6 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to a $11.7 million increase in operating income, $3.0 million increase in investment income and $12.0 million decrease in income tax provision. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $21.0 million decrease in general and administrative expense due to reduced legal provision and related costs as further discussed in Note 19 and partially offset by $8.0 million of restructuring expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telematics Systems\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software & Subscription Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,699\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,794\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (905\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,167\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased $8.1 million compared to the same period last year due to lower revenues as described above and the impact of high margin revenue earned on a strategic technology partnership arrangement in fiscal 2018. These factors were coupled with higher operating expenses in Telematics Systems as a result of increased headcount and outsourced professional service fees. Adjusted EBITDA for Software and Subscription Services increased $4.9 million compared to the same period last year due primarily to continued growth in revenues and gross profit from our Italia market and higher gross profit from our fleet management services.\nSee Note 20 for reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and a reconciliation to GAAP-basis net income (loss).\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended February 28, 2017:\nRevenue by Segment\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telematics Systems\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 302,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 274,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software & Subscription Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,069\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 365,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 351,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTelematics Systems revenue increased by $27.8 million or 10.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to an increase in sales volume for our MRM telematics products and OEM products as demand from our top customers increased due to more favorable conditions in the fleet management, asset tracking and heavy equipment markets. The increase in units sold in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of our products during the year.\nSoftware & Subscription Services revenue increased by $2.1 million or 3.3% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year.

The increase was primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits due to increased headcount. Consolidated research and development expense as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.0% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. We are investing in research and development of software applications and products technologies to be sold through the U.S. and international sales channels.\nConsolidated selling and marketing expense increased by $1.1 million or 2.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in employee benefit expenses and incentive compensation as well as an increase in professional services as we completed our CalAmp and LoJack brand refresh initiatives during fiscal 2018.\nConsolidated general and administrative expense decreased by $5.0 million or 8.8% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in legal expenses related to a patent infringement lawsuit.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by $0.1 million or 0.5% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year due to completion of amortization on certain older intangible assets.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net\nInvestment income increased by $0.6 million to $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 from $1.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to an increase in investment income on Rabbi Trust assets that serve to informally fund our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and an increase in dividend income from a minority owned international licensee.\nInterest expense increased $0.4 million to $10.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 from $9.9 million for the same period last year due to increased amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with the convertible notes issued in May 2015.\nSee Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the $28.3 million gain on the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack.\nOther non-operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.5 million from net non-operating expense for the same period last year due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Euros to U.S. dollars.\nProfitability Measures\nNet income:\nThe net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 was $16.6 million as compared to a net loss of $7.9 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily the result of the $28.3 million non-operating gain from the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack, which was recognized during fiscal 2018. This gain was partially offset by higher tax expense in fiscal 2018 due to U.S. and foreign taxes on the $28.3 million legal settlement gain as well as the revaluation of our net deferred income tax assets that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as we adopted the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal years ended February 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telematics Systems\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software & Subscription Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,794\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,586\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,208\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased $1.5 million compared to the same period last year due to higher MRM products revenue.

We have historically funded our principal business activities through cash flows generated from operations. As we continue to grow our customer base and increase our revenues, there will be a need for working capital in the future. Our immediate sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and our revolving credit facility. As of February 28, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $274.0 million.\nOn March 30, 2018, we entered into a revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that provides for borrowings of up to $50 million. This revolving credit facility expires on March 30, 2020. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at either a Prime or LIBOR-based variable rate as selected by us on a periodic basis. This revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum level of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other noncash charges (EBITDA) and minimum debt coverage ratios. Throughout fiscal 2019 and as of February 28, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility.\nHistorically, we have used funding from external sources to finance general corporate expenditures and other strategic initiatives including acquisitions and share repurchases. In May 2015, we issued $172.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior notes which are due in May 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2020 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election. We intend to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and we believe that we will have adequate cash available to repay the notes by its maturity date. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Convertible Notes to fund the acquisition of LoJack as well as a stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2016. The acquisition of LoJack resulted in us funding a purchase price of approximately $122 million, net of cash acquired. The stock repurchase program resulted in us repurchasing 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock from June 2016 through January 2017 at an average cost of $14.20 per share, which accounts for the cash outflow of $25 million in fiscal 2017.\nOn July 20, 2018, we issued 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, (the 2025 Convertible Notes\u201d), with a principal amount of $230.0 million. The net proceeds from our sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes were $222.7 million, net of issuance costs of $7.3 million. We used approximately $90.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay (i) the cost of the capped call transactions of $21.2 million; (ii) repurchase shares of our common stock of approximately $15.0 million, and (iii) repurchase principal of our outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for approximately $53.8 million including accrued interest. As part of the repurchase of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we also unwound the related note hedges and warrants, which provided us proceeds of $3.1 million. We expect to use the remainder of the proceeds from the 2025 Convertible Notes for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include but not limited to, additional repurchases of the 2020 Convertible Notes, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We also intend to settle the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion and we believe that we will have adequate cash available to repay the notes by the maturity date.\nAs described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in February 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited, a LoJack licensee, which was funded from our cash on hand. The total purchase price was \u00a310.0 million, or approximately $13.0 million. In the same month, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Car Track, S.A. DE C.V., the exclusive licensee of LoJack technology for the Mexican market. The agreement was to purchase the 87.5% of the Car Track shares not currently owned by us for a purchase price, net of cash on hand, of approximately $13.0 million. We completed the acquisition in March 2019. In April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions, a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. The total purchase price was approximately $50 million.\nWe are a defendant in various legal proceedings involving intellectual property claims and contract disputes matters whereby the final settlement has not been determined at this time. In connection with these matters, we may have to enter into license agreements or other settlement arrangements that could require us to make significant payments in the future. Based on current information available, we do not believe that there are any claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings.\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, intangible asset amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of convertible debt issue costs and discount, deferred income taxes and other investment related matters as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nOur cash flow from operating activities are attributable to our net income as well as how well we manage our working capital, which is dictated by the volume of product we purchase from our manufacturers or suppliers and then sell to our customers along with the payment and collection terms that we negotiate with them. We purchase a majority of our product from significant suppliers located in Asia that generally provide us 60 day payment terms for products purchased. Our significant customers are located in the U.S. as well as certain international locations. We believe that our relationship with our customers is very good and that these customers are in good financial condition. We generally grant credit to our customers based on their financial viability and our historical collection experience with them. We typically require payment from them within 30 to 45 days of our invoice date. Since we are paying our suppliers at or within 60 days of inventory purchase and our payment terms on our accounts receivable are within 45 days, we have historically generated positive cash flows from operating activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.7 million. Net income was $18.4 million which benefited by a $18.3 million gain from a legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack that was realized as non-operating income during the fiscal year. Our non-cash expenses, comprised principally of depreciation, intangible assets amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of convertible debt issue costs and discount, deferred income taxes and impairment loss and equity in net loss of affiliate was a $51.3 million source of cash in fiscal 2019. Changes in operating assets and liabilities represented a $22.3 million usage of cash, primarily driven by changes in working capital including a decrease in accrued liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable but partially offset by a decrease in inventory and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue.\nFor the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $66.9 million and $25.8 million, respectively. Our cash flows from operations were impacted by our net income (loss) of $16.6 million and $(7.9) million, respectively, as well as similar activities within other non-cash items and changes in working capital as noted above.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash used in investing activities was $21.8 million, $26.5 million, and $45.6 million, respectively. In each of these periods, our primary investing activities consisted of the purchase and sale of marketable securities in accordance with our corporate investment policy as well as strategic initiatives including certain investments in and advances to our affiliate and acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of TRACKER for approximately $13.0 million, and in fiscal 2017, we completed the acquisition of LoJack for approximately $117.0 million, net of cash acquired.\nOur investing activities include capital expenditures to support our increased employee headcount and overall growth in our business. We expect that we will make additional capital expenditures in the future, including the further build-out of our corporate offices and IT infrastructure, all of which will be done to support the future growth of our business.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $98.5 million, $(2.3) million and $(25.8) million, respectively. In each of these periods, we incurred payments for taxes related to the net share settlement of vested equity awards and the proceeds for the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2019, we issued $230.0 million of the 2025 Convertible Notes and used the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions; repurchase shares of our common stock for $49 million, and repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes as discussed above for $53.7 million. We also received proceeds of $3.1 million from the unwinding of the note hedges and warrants related to the 2020 Convertible Notes.\nOn May 7, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $30.0 million of our outstanding common stock. On July 16, 2018, our Board of Directors increased it to $39.0 million. As of February 28, 2019, the entire $39.0 million authorized by our Board of Directors had been utilized.\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock over the next 12 months. As of February 28, 2019, $10.0 million has been utilized.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds anticipated to be generated from our operations and available borrowing on our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the timing and extent of spending on various business initiatives, our international expansion, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nFollowing is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of February 28, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Future Estimated Cash Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> > 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 352,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes stated interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 464,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amount we report as assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analytical framework for transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In order to adhere to this core principle, we apply the following five-step approach:\n \u2022 identify the contract with a customer; \n \u2022 identify the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u2022 determine the transaction price; \n \u2022 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u2022 recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for goods or services we transfer to the customer.\nThe two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. We adopted the new standard effective March 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which we applied to all contracts that were not completed on adoption date. We applied the provisions of ASC 605 to revenue recognized during each of the fiscal years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017. In the section titled Recently Issued Accounting Standards below, we have presented a comparison of the results under ASC 606 and ASC 605 for the year ended February 28, 2019.\nProducts. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price, which is generally the stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods. For product shipments made on the basis of FOB Destination\u201d terms, revenue is recorded when the products reach the customer. Customers generally do not have a right of return except for defective products returned during the warranty period. We record estimated commitments related to customer incentive programs as reductions of revenues.\nProfessional Services. We also provide various professional services to customers. These include project management, engineering services, installation services and an on-going early warning automated notification service, which are typically distinct from other performance obligations and are recognized as the related services are performed. For certain professional service contracts, we recognize revenue based on the proportion of total costs incurred to-date over the estimated cost of the contract, which is an input method.\nSoftware-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our SaaS-based subscriptions for our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other verticals provide our customers with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile or remote assets via our software applications. The transaction price for a typical SaaS arrangement includes the price for the hardware, accessories, installation and application subscriptions. Generally, we defer the recognition of revenue for the customized devices that only function with our applications and are sold on an integrated basis with applicable subscriptions. Such customized devices and the application services are not sold separately. In such circumstances, the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs in the balance sheet. The upfront fees for the devices are not distinct from the subscription service and are combined into the subscription service performance obligation. Generally, these service arrangements do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the subscription service at any time. Revenues from subscription services are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the subscription. Subscription renewal fees are recognized ratably over the term of the renewal. The deferred product revenue and deferred product cost amounts are amortized to Application Subscriptions and Related Products and Other Services revenue and cost of revenue, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices, which are three years in the vehicle finance and four years in the fleet management verticals. Our deferred contract revenue under ASC 606 does not include future subscription fees associated with customers' unexercised contract renewal rights.\nIn certain customer arrangements, we also sell devices together with monitoring services, for which revenues for the sales of the devices are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer and monitoring services are recognized over the service period as the devices and services are customarily part of one customer contractual arrangement. The allocation of the transaction price is based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices for the devices and the monitoring services. The revenues under these arrangements are included within Application Subscription and Related Products and Other Services revenues and costs of revenues in our statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nSales taxes. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer.\nContract Balances. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing on our invoicing to customers. Contract liabilities are comprised of billings or payments received from our customers in advance of performance under the contract. We refer to these contract liabilities as Deferred Revenues\u201d in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer consist of deferred costs of hardware and sales commissions. The deferred costs of hardware are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the device on a straight-line basis. We determined that sales commissions are generally recognized within one year. Therefore, we have elected the practical expedient to expense sales commission costs as incurred.\nWe adopted ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method on March 1, 2018, and therefore we did not present comparative information for the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consists of amounts due from sales arrangements executed in our normal business activities and are recorded at invoiced amounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for uncollectible receivables. We determine the sufficiency of the accounts receivable allowance based upon historical experience and an evaluation of current industry trends and economic conditions. If our actual collection experience varies significantly from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts. Historical variances of these amounts from our estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our financial statements.\nInventories\nWe evaluate the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices. To the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values, inventory carrying amounts are written down. In addition, we generally treat inventory on hand or committed with suppliers, that is not expected to be sold in the near term, as excess and thus appropriate write-downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of revenues. Estimated usage in the next 12 months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management's estimate of sales beyond existing backlog, giving consideration to customers' forecasted demand, ordering patterns and product life cycles. A large portion of our inventory was purchased within the last two years, which we believe mitigates our exposure to material excess or obsolescence at this time, although ongoing changes in cellular carrier technology, supplier changes, closure of our warehouse facilities, changes in demand or significant reductions in product pricing may necessitate additional write-downs of inventory carrying value in the future, which could be material.\nProduct Warranty\nOur products generally have a one- or two-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects and workmanship. We estimate the future costs relating to product returns subject to our warranty and record a reserve upon shipment of our products. We periodically adjust our estimates for actual warranty claims, historical claims experience as well as the impact of the known product operational issues.\nWhile we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation can be affected by product, material and workmanship failures which may be outside of our control. If the actual factors leading to a product failure differ from management's assumptions, revisions to our estimated product warranty provision would be required and recorded to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) at the time of the change in estimate.\nPatent Litigation and Other Contingencies\nWe operate in an industry where there may be certain claims made against us related to patent infringement and other matters. We accrue for these claims whenever we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the liability is reasonably estimable. The amount of the accrual is estimated based on our review of each individual claim, including the type and facts of the claim and our assessment of the merits of the claim. Since these legal matters can be very complex and require significant judgement, we often utilize external legal counsel and other subject matter experts to assist us in defending against such claims. These accruals are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis and are adjusted to reflect the impact of recent negotiations, settlements, court rulings, advice from legal counsel and other events pertaining to the case. Although we believe that we take reasonable and considerable measures to mitigate our exposure in these matters, the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable. Nonetheless, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to pending legal matters against us as well as adequate provisions for probable and estimable losses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method when accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect\non deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Valuation allowances are provided against tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. In assessing valuation allowances, we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors, including cumulative earnings experience, expectations of future taxable income by jurisdiction, and the carryforward periods available for income tax purposes. We make estimates, assumptions and judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. In relation to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, allowed companies to record provisional amounts related to the tax effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act in 2018, and no material adjustments were required to the provisional amounts initially recorded on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the aggregate fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and labilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. We determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information, including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and other estimates made by management. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date impacting the asset valuations and liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, these estimates are uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, the impact of any subsequent adjustments is included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nGoodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt February 28, 2019, we had $80.8 million in goodwill and $47.2 million in other net intangible assets, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and consists primarily of goodwill from the LoJack acquisitions. Goodwill has been allocated to each of our two operating segments, which also represent our reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized but we perform an annual qualitative assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or at other reporting periods within the fiscal year as may be required, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in our stock price, significant differences in our forecasts compared to actual results, changes in our business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If further testing is required, we perform a two-step process. The first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the purpose of impairment testing, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units to be higher than the book value as of February 28, 2019. As a result, we have determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill for all periods presented.\nAcquired intangible assets with definite lives consist primarily of asset acquired in the LoJack acquisition, including tradenames, dealer relationships and developed technology and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products, technologies or relationships. We review our definite lived long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the lowest level of asset group is expected to generate. Given the interdependencies of revenues across our segments, product and service verticals and geographies, our asset groups are generally our two operating segments. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. There has been no impairment of long-lived assets for any periods presented.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nWe assess whether there are indicators that the value of our equity method investments may be impaired. An impairment charge is recognized only if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below our carrying value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of impairment is highly subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about our intent and ability to recover our investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment, including the level of our involvement therein, among other factors. To the extent an impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Impairment losses are included in Impairment loss and equity in net loss affiliate.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nOur stock-based compensation expense results from grants of employee and non-employee equity awards and is recognized in our consolidated financial statements based on the respective grant date fair values of the awards. The measurement of stock-based compensation expense is based on several criteria, including the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate. We recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis for our graded-vesting awards. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. However, the cumulative compensation expense recognized at any point in time must at least equal the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If any of these assumptions used in the valuation model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards could differ materially from the previously granted equity awards.\nForward Looking Statements\nForward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions, projections and other information regarding future performance, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(referred to herein as CalAmp\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d, or us\u201d) is a telematics solutions pioneer leading transformation in a global connected economy. We help reinvent businesses and improve lives around the globe with technology solutions that streamline complex mobile Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) deployments through wireless connectivity solutions and derived data intelligence. Our software applications, scalable cloud services, and intelligent devices collect and assess business-critical data anywhere in the world from industrial machines, commercial and passenger vehicles, their drivers and contents. With our global network of LoJack licensees and a strong ecosystem of industry partnerships, we bring intelligence to the edge in the mobile connected economy to help drive business efficiencies. We are headquartered in Irvine, California but expanding into international markets with our telematics technology solutions.\nIn February 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited, which brings us strong brand awareness across the United Kingdom and extensive law enforcement relationships with an ability to help drive our expansion in Europe. In March 2019, we acquired Car Track, S.A. de C.V., which will leverage our full stack of telematics and SaaS solutions to expand product offerings to our substantial subscriber base.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions ( Synovia\u201d), a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. Combined with the recent acquisitions of TRACKER and Car Track, the Synovia acquisition expands our fleet management and vehicle safety services portfolio and accelerates our transformation to high-value subscription-based services.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: Telematics Systems and Software & Subscription Services.\nTelematics Systems\nOur Telematics Systems segment offers a series of advanced telematics and SVR products for the broader connected vehicle and emerging Internet of Machines marketplace, which enable customers to optimize their operations by collecting, monitoring and effectively reporting business-critical information and desired intelligence from high-value remote and mobile assets. Our telematics products include asset tracking units, mobile telematics devices, fixed and mobile wireless gateways, and routers. These wireless networking devices underpin a wide range of solutions, and are ideal for applications demanding secure, reliable and business-critical communications.\nSoftware & Subscription Services\nOur Software & Subscription Services segment offers cloud-based application enablement and telematics service platforms that facilitate integration of our own applications, as well as those of third parties, through open Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs\u201d) to deliver full-featured mobile IoT solutions to a wide range of customers and markets. Our scalable proprietary applications and other subscription services enable rapid and cost-effective development of high-value solutions for customers all around the globe.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nRevenues\nAs described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted the new standard effective March 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which we applied to all contracts.\nProducts. Our products revenues consist primarily of sales of our telematics and SVR products or wireless networking devices to large global companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises in the U.S. and internationally. Revenues from our products are reported net of sales returns and allowances, and incentives. The prices charged for telematics and SVR products are determined through negotiation with our customers as well as prevailing market conditions and are fixed and determinable upon shipment.\nProfessional Services. Our professional services provided to customers include project management, engineering services, installation services and an on-going early warning automated notification service. Revenues are typically distinct from other performance obligations and are recognized as the related services are performed.\nSoftware-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our SaaS-based subscriptions for our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other verticals provide our customers with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile or remote assets via our software applications. For our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other customers, we sell highly customized devices that only function with our SaaS technology. Generally, we defer the recognition of revenue for the customized products that only function with our application and are sold on an integrated basis. The deferred product revenue amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices, which are three years in the vehicle finance vertical and four years in the fleet management vertical. Revenues from subscription services are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the subscription.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues for products represent the cost of finished goods sold to our customers. These costs include raw materials, manufacturing overhead and labor costs, as well as customs and duties, license royalties, recycling fees, insurance and other costs that are included in the price that we negotiate and pay to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for the products. The cost of revenues also include charges related to excess and obsolete inventories and the cost of fulfilling product warranties.\nOur cost of revenues for application subscriptions and other services includes personnel costs and related benefits, consultants, software development activities, cellular network access costs, infrastructure costs for use of private networking services, and other costs that are required to deliver these services to our customers. Our cost of revenues for application subscriptions and other services also includes cost of customized devices that only function with our applications and are sold on an integrated basis with applicable subscriptions. The costs are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices. The estimated average in-service lives are three years in the vehicle finances and four years in the fleet management verticals.\nWe continually negotiate to reduce the cost we pay to our suppliers in order to maintain consistent low prices for our customers. We accomplish this by working with our suppliers to find alternative, less expensive sources of raw materials and components as well as eliminating excess costs throughout our supply chain.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, or gross margin, is influenced by several factors including sales volume, product and service mix, and changes in product costs. We expect gross margin to fluctuate over time based on how we control the mix of product and services and manage our inventory using sales incentives granted to our customers. Additionally, although we primarily procure and sell our products in U.S. dollars, we are susceptible to exchange rate fluctuations with other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably this may have an impact on our future selling prices and unit costs. Gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate over time based on the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, including salaries and bonuses, fringe benefits and stock-based compensation as well as the cost of professional services, information technology, facilities and other administrative expenses. We classify our operating expenses into the following four categories:\n \u2022 Research and development expense consists of personnel related costs, professional services, certification fees and software licenses incurred to support our existing install-base of telematics devices through our field application engineers, software developers, program and product managers, as well as our effort to develop new products and technologies. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing expense consists of personnel related costs including our incentive programs to support our global sales organization as well as advertising and marketing promotions of our brand and products, including media advertisement costs, merchandising and display costs, trade show and event costs, and sponsorship costs. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs to support our global enterprise as well as outside services for legal, accounting, insurance, information technology, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company. \n \u2022 Restructuring expense consists of personnel and facility related costs resulting from our cost savings initiative commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Personnel costs represent severance and employee related costs, and facility charges represent expenses for vacant office and manufacturing facility space under Corporate Expenses. \n \u2022 Intangible asset amortization is attributable to our acquired identifiable intangible assets from business combinations. Our acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized from the date of acquisition over periods ranging from two to ten years. \nWe expect our operating costs will increase in absolute dollars due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as expansion into new geographic regions. Operating expense may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues throughout the year due to discrete quarterly events and seasonal trends.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nNon-operating income (expense) consists of (i) investment and interest income earned on our cash balances and investments, (ii) interest expense on our convertible senior unsecured notes including the amortization of note discount and debt issue costs, (iii) the gain on a legal settlement, (iv) the loss from extinguishment of debt and (v) other income (expense) that includes but is not limited to transaction gains and losses and foreign currency gains and losses. We recognize the gain on legal settlement on a cash basis due to the lack of certainty of collection as we received the settlement payments from a former LoJack supplier, which is further explained in Note 19 - Legal Proceedings\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Loss from extinguishment of debt is further explained in Note 10 - Financing Arrangements\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and related states as well as foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Our effective tax rate will approximate the U.S. statutory income tax rate plus the apportionment of state income taxes coupled with our foreign statutory rate based on the portion of taxable income allocable to each tax jurisdiction.\nImpairment Loss and Equity in Net Loss of Affiliate\nWe have an investment in a technology and insurance startup company called Smart Driver Club Limited, which represents a minority ownership interest that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting since we have significant influence over the investee. As a result, we record our portion of the losses incurred by this entity and impairment charges related to these investments as equity in net loss of affiliate.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the statements of comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets or statements of cash flows. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Earnings Before Investment Income, Interest Expenses, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, non-cash costs and expenses arising from purchase accounting adjustments, litigation provision, gain from legal settlement and certain other adjustments. Our CEO, the CODM, uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and monitor\nsegment performance. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison to help investors evaluate our results of ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Pursuant to the rule and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and reconciliation to net income (loss).\nOPERATING RESULTS\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by items included in our consolidated statements of income for the three most recent fiscal years:\n\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to fiscal year ended February 28, 2018:\nRevenue by Segment\n\nTelematics Systems revenue decreased by $14.8 million or 4.9% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced sales of our MRM telematics and legacy LoJack SVR products and partially offset by increased demand in OEM products. During the fiscal year, we initiated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. In connection with this program, we experienced various operational challenges and extended lead times on certain components thereby impacting our ability to delivery on customer orders for MRM telematics products. Additionally, our legacy LoJack SVR revenue continued its secular decline due to a technology transition from proprietary radio frequency technology to GPS-based telematics solutions. This decline is expected to be offset by future growth in our telematics solutions, such as SureDrive and LotSmart, over time. OEM products sales increased as demand from our customers, including our top customer, increased due to more favorable conditions in the heavy equipment markets.\nSoftware & Subscription Services revenue increased by $12.6 million or 19.8% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to growth driven by our fleet management and LoJack subscription services.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\n\nConsolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased by $3.1 million or 2.1% over the prior year due to lower revenue in our Telematics Systems business. Gross profit in fiscal year 2019 was adversely impacted by higher excess and obsolete inventory charges as we transition suppliers and contract manufacturers, and manage the closure of our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of revenues above excludes restructuring related costs, which are shown separately in the operating expenses in our condensed consolidation statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nOperating Expenses\n\nConsolidated research and development expense increased by $1.9 million or 7.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits due to increased headcount. Consolidated research and development expense as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.6% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to 7.0% in the same period last year. We are investing in research and development of new products and technologies to be sold through the U.S. and international sales channels.\nConsolidated selling and marketing expense decreased by $0.2 million or 0.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in professional services and web design costs, as we substantially completed our CalAmp and LoJack brand refresh initiatives during the prior fiscal year. The decrease was partially offset by increases in marketing expenses to support various business developments in international territories.\nConsolidated general and administrative expense decreased by $21.0 million or 40.4% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in litigation provisions and expenses related to existing legal matters (see Note 19). The decrease was partially offset by increased professional services coupled with service fees related to a new cloud-based ERP system that we are implementing to support the growth in our global operations. Certain implementation costs on the new ERP system were capitalized as Property and Equipment in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2018, we commenced a plan to capture certain synergies and cost savings related to streamlining our global operations and sales organization as well as rationalize certain leased properties that are partially vacant. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, we recorded approximately $4.3 million in severance and employee related costs as well as $3.7 million in rent and related costs associated with office and manufacturing plant facilities where we have ceased use.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by $3.6 million or 23.7% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period last year due to completion of amortization on certain intangible assets.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net\nInvestment income increased by $3.0 million to $5.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 from $2.3 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income resulting from increased investments in various cash equivalent and short-term marketable securities primarily as a result of the net proceeds from our 2025 Convertible Notes and operating cash flows.\nInterest expense increased $6.4 million to $16.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 from $10.3 million for the same period last year due to additional interest expense and debt discount and issue costs relating to the 2025 Convertible Notes issued in July 2018 that are being amortized on the effective interest method.\nSee Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning the $18.3 million gain on the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on the $2.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nOther non-operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 increased $1.1 million from net non-operating expense for the same period last year due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Euros to U.S. dollars.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nAn income tax benefit of $1.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2019, compared to an income tax expense of $10.7 million in fiscal 2018. The change in the income tax expense (benefit) compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the $9.0 million provisional tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recorded in fiscal 2018 and a decrease in our valuation allowances against non-US deferred tax assets in the amount of $4.4 million. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProfitability Measures\nNet Income:\nOur net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 was $18.4 million as compared to net income of $16.6 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to a $11.7 million increase in operating income, $3.0 million increase in investment income and $12.0 million decrease in income tax provision. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $21.0 million decrease in general and administrative expense due to reduced legal provision and related costs as further discussed in Note 19 and partially offset by $8.0 million of restructuring expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased $8.1 million compared to the same period last year due to lower revenues as described above and the impact of high margin revenue earned on a strategic technology partnership arrangement in fiscal 2018. These factors were coupled with higher operating expenses in Telematics Systems as a result of increased headcount and outsourced professional service fees. Adjusted EBITDA for Software and Subscription Services increased $4.9 million compared to the same period last year due primarily to continued growth in revenues and gross profit from our Italia market and higher gross profit from our fleet management services.\nSee Note 20 for reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and a reconciliation to GAAP-basis net income (loss).\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended February 28, 2017:\nRevenue by Segment\n\nTelematics Systems revenue increased by $27.8 million or 10.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to an increase in sales volume for our MRM telematics products and OEM products as demand from our top customers increased due to more favorable conditions in the fleet management, asset tracking and heavy equipment markets. The increase in units sold in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of our products during the year.\nSoftware & Subscription Services revenue increased by $2.1 million or 3.3% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to growth in our Italian operations along with a more favorable Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate compared to the same period last year.\nSatellite revenue decreased by $15.1 million or 100% as this business ceased to exist in fiscal 2017.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\n\nConsolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased by $7.5 million or 5.3% over the prior year. The increase was due to higher revenue in the Telematics Systems business partially offset by the decline in our Satellite segment as this segment was shutdown effective August 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses\n\nConsolidated research and development expense increased by $3.8 million or 17.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits due to increased headcount. Consolidated research and development expense as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.0% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. We are investing in research and development of software applications and products technologies to be sold through the U.S. and international sales channels.\nConsolidated selling and marketing expense increased by $1.1 million or 2.1% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in employee benefit expenses and incentive compensation as well as an increase in professional services as we completed our CalAmp and LoJack brand refresh initiatives during fiscal 2018.\nConsolidated general and administrative expense decreased by $5.0 million or 8.8% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in legal expenses related to a patent infringement lawsuit.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by $0.1 million or 0.5% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same period last year due to completion of amortization on certain older intangible assets.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net\nInvestment income increased by $0.6 million to $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 from $1.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to an increase in investment income on Rabbi Trust assets that serve to informally fund our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and an increase in dividend income from a minority owned international licensee.\nInterest expense increased $0.4 million to $10.3 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 from $9.9 million for the same period last year due to increased amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with the convertible notes issued in May 2015.\nSee Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the $28.3 million gain on the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack.\nOther non-operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.5 million from net non-operating expense for the same period last year due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Euros to U.S. dollars.\nProfitability Measures\nNet income:\nThe net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 was $16.6 million as compared to a net loss of $7.9 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily the result of the $28.3 million non-operating gain from the legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack, which was recognized during fiscal 2018. This gain was partially offset by higher tax expense in fiscal 2018 due to U.S. and foreign taxes on the $28.3 million legal settlement gain as well as the revaluation of our net deferred income tax assets that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as we adopted the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 increased $1.5 million compared to the same period last year due to higher MRM products revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for Software and\nSubscription Services increased $5.2 million compared to the same period last year due primarily to lower selling and marketing expenses and lower general and administrative expenses.\nSee Note 20 for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segments and a reconciliation to GAAP-basis net income (loss).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn fiscal 2019, our primary cash needs have been for acquisition related costs, working capital purposes and, to a lesser extent, capital expenditures and investments in and advances to affiliates. We have historically funded our principal business activities through cash flows generated from operations. As we continue to grow our customer base and increase our revenues, there will be a need for working capital in the future. Our immediate sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and our revolving credit facility. As of February 28, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $274.0 million.\nOn March 30, 2018, we entered into a revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that provides for borrowings of up to $50 million. This revolving credit facility expires on March 30, 2020. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at either a Prime or LIBOR-based variable rate as selected by us on a periodic basis. This revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum level of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other noncash charges (EBITDA) and minimum debt coverage ratios. Throughout fiscal 2019 and as of February 28, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility.\nHistorically, we have used funding from external sources to finance general corporate expenditures and other strategic initiatives including acquisitions and share repurchases. In May 2015, we issued $172.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior notes which are due in May 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2020 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election. We intend to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and we believe that we will have adequate cash available to repay the notes by its maturity date. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Convertible Notes to fund the acquisition of LoJack as well as a stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2016. The acquisition of LoJack resulted in us funding a purchase price of approximately $122 million, net of cash acquired. The stock repurchase program resulted in us repurchasing 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock from June 2016 through January 2017 at an average cost of $14.20 per share, which accounts for the cash outflow of $25 million in fiscal 2017.\nOn July 20, 2018, we issued 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, (the 2025 Convertible Notes\u201d), with a principal amount of $230.0 million. The net proceeds from our sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes were $222.7 million, net of issuance costs of $7.3 million. We used approximately $90.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay (i) the cost of the capped call transactions of $21.2 million; (ii) repurchase shares of our common stock of approximately $15.0 million, and (iii) repurchase principal of our outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for approximately $53.8 million including accrued interest. As part of the repurchase of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we also unwound the related note hedges and warrants, which provided us proceeds of $3.1 million. We expect to use the remainder of the proceeds from the 2025 Convertible Notes for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include but not limited to, additional repurchases of the 2020 Convertible Notes, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We also intend to settle the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion and we believe that we will have adequate cash available to repay the notes by the maturity date.\nAs described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in February 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited, a LoJack licensee, which was funded from our cash on hand. The total purchase price was \u00a310.0 million, or approximately $13.0 million. In the same month, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Car Track, S.A. DE C.V., the exclusive licensee of LoJack technology for the Mexican market. The agreement was to purchase the 87.5% of the Car Track shares not currently owned by us for a purchase price, net of cash on hand, of approximately $13.0 million. We completed the acquisition in March 2019. In April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions, a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. The total purchase price was approximately $50 million.\nWe are a defendant in various legal proceedings involving intellectual property claims and contract disputes matters whereby the final settlement has not been determined at this time. In connection with these matters, we may have to enter into license agreements or other settlement arrangements that could require us to make significant payments in the future. Based on current information available, we do not believe that there are any claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings.\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, intangible asset amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of convertible debt issue costs and discount, deferred income taxes and other investment related matters as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nOur cash flow from operating activities are attributable to our net income as well as how well we manage our working capital, which is dictated by the volume of product we purchase from our manufacturers or suppliers and then sell to our customers along with the payment and collection terms that we negotiate with them. We purchase a majority of our product from significant suppliers located in Asia that generally provide us 60 day payment terms for products purchased. Our significant customers are located in the U.S. as well as certain international locations. We believe that our relationship with our customers is very good and that these customers are in good financial condition. We generally grant credit to our customers based on their financial viability and our historical collection experience with them. We typically require payment from them within 30 to 45 days of our invoice date. Since we are paying our suppliers at or within 60 days of inventory purchase and our payment terms on our accounts receivable are within 45 days, we have historically generated positive cash flows from operating activities.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.7 million. Net income was $18.4 million which benefited by a $18.3 million gain from a legal settlement with a former supplier of LoJack that was realized as non-operating income during the fiscal year. Our non-cash expenses, comprised principally of depreciation, intangible assets amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of convertible debt issue costs and discount, deferred income taxes and impairment loss and equity in net loss of affiliate was a $51.3 million source of cash in fiscal 2019. Changes in operating assets and liabilities represented a $22.3 million usage of cash, primarily driven by changes in working capital including a decrease in accrued liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable but partially offset by a decrease in inventory and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue.\nFor the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $66.9 million and $25.8 million, respectively. Our cash flows from operations were impacted by our net income (loss) of $16.6 million and $(7.9) million, respectively, as well as similar activities within other non-cash items and changes in working capital as noted above.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash used in investing activities was $21.8 million, $26.5 million, and $45.6 million, respectively. In each of these periods, our primary investing activities consisted of the purchase and sale of marketable securities in accordance with our corporate investment policy as well as strategic initiatives including certain investments in and advances to our affiliate and acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of TRACKER for approximately $13.0 million, and in fiscal 2017, we completed the acquisition of LoJack for approximately $117.0 million, net of cash acquired.\nOur investing activities include capital expenditures to support our increased employee headcount and overall growth in our business. We expect that we will make additional capital expenditures in the future, including the further build-out of our corporate offices and IT infrastructure, all of which will be done to support the future growth of our business.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $98.5 million, $(2.3) million and $(25.8) million, respectively. In each of these periods, we incurred payments for taxes related to the net share settlement of vested equity awards and the proceeds for the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2019, we issued $230.0 million of the 2025 Convertible Notes and used the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions; repurchase shares of our common stock for $49 million, and repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes as discussed above for $53.7 million. We also received proceeds of $3.1 million from the unwinding of the note hedges and warrants related to the 2020 Convertible Notes.\nOn May 7, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $30.0 million of our outstanding common stock. On July 16, 2018, our Board of Directors increased it to $39.0 million. As of February 28, 2019, the entire $39.0 million authorized by our Board of Directors had been utilized.\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock over the next 12 months. As of February 28, 2019, $10.0 million has been utilized.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds anticipated to be generated from our operations and available borrowing on our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the timing and extent of spending on various business initiatives, our international expansion, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nFollowing is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of February 28, 2019 (in thousands):\n\nPurchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amount we report as assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analytical framework for transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In order to adhere to this core principle, we apply the following five-step approach:\n \u2022 identify the contract with a customer; \n \u2022 identify the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u2022 determine the transaction price; \n \u2022 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u2022 recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for goods or services we transfer to the customer.\nThe two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. We adopted the new standard effective March 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method, which we applied to all contracts that were not completed on adoption date. We applied the provisions of ASC 605 to revenue recognized during each of the fiscal years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017. In the section titled Recently Issued Accounting Standards below, we have presented a comparison of the results under ASC 606 and ASC 605 for the year ended February 28, 2019.\nProducts. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price, which is generally the stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods. For product shipments made on the basis of FOB Destination\u201d terms, revenue is recorded when the products reach the customer. Customers generally do not have a right of return except for defective products returned during the warranty period. We record estimated commitments related to customer incentive programs as reductions of revenues.\nProfessional Services. We also provide various professional services to customers. These include project management, engineering services, installation services and an on-going early warning automated notification service, which are typically distinct from other performance obligations and are recognized as the related services are performed. For certain professional service contracts, we recognize revenue based on the proportion of total costs incurred to-date over the estimated cost of the contract, which is an input method.\nSoftware-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our SaaS-based subscriptions for our fleet management, vehicle finance and certain other verticals provide our customers with the ability to wirelessly communicate with monitoring devices installed in vehicles and other mobile or remote assets via our software applications. The transaction price for a typical SaaS arrangement includes the price for the hardware, accessories, installation and application subscriptions. Generally, we defer the recognition of revenue for the customized devices that only function with our applications and are sold on an integrated basis with applicable subscriptions. Such customized devices and the application services are not sold separately. In such circumstances, the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs in the balance sheet. The upfront fees for the devices are not distinct from the subscription service and are combined into the subscription service performance obligation. Generally, these service arrangements do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the subscription service at any time. Revenues from subscription services are recognized ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the subscription. Subscription renewal fees are recognized ratably over the term of the renewal. The deferred product revenue and deferred product cost amounts are amortized to Application Subscriptions and Related Products and Other Services revenue and cost of revenue, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the estimated average in-service lives of these devices, which are three years in the vehicle finance and four years in the fleet management verticals. Our deferred contract revenue under ASC 606 does not include future subscription fees associated with customers' unexercised contract renewal rights.\nIn certain customer arrangements, we also sell devices together with monitoring services, for which revenues for the sales of the devices are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer and monitoring services are recognized over the service period as the devices and services are customarily part of one customer contractual arrangement. The allocation of the transaction price is based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices for the devices and the monitoring services. The revenues under these arrangements are included within Application Subscription and Related Products and Other Services revenues and costs of revenues in our statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nSales taxes. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer.\nContract Balances. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing on our invoicing to customers. Contract liabilities are comprised of billings or payments received from our customers in advance of performance under the contract. We refer to these contract liabilities as Deferred Revenues\u201d in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer consist of deferred costs of hardware and sales commissions. The deferred costs of hardware are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the device on a straight-line basis. We determined that sales commissions are generally recognized within one year. Therefore, we have elected the practical expedient to expense sales commission costs as incurred.\nWe adopted ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method on March 1, 2018, and therefore we did not present comparative information for the years ended February 28, 2018 and 2017.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consists of amounts due from sales arrangements executed in our normal business activities and are recorded at invoiced amounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for uncollectible receivables. We determine the sufficiency of the accounts receivable allowance based upon historical experience and an evaluation of current industry trends and economic conditions. If our actual collection experience varies significantly from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts. Historical variances of these amounts from our estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our financial statements.\nInventories\nWe evaluate the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices. To the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values, inventory carrying amounts are written down. In addition, we generally treat inventory on hand or committed with suppliers, that is not expected to be sold in the near term, as excess and thus appropriate write-downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of revenues. Estimated usage in the next 12 months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management's estimate of sales beyond existing backlog, giving consideration to customers' forecasted demand, ordering patterns and product life cycles. A large portion of our inventory was purchased within the last two years, which we believe mitigates our exposure to material excess or obsolescence at this time, although ongoing changes in cellular carrier technology, supplier changes, closure of our warehouse facilities, changes in demand or significant reductions in product pricing may necessitate additional write-downs of inventory carrying value in the future, which could be material.\nProduct Warranty\nOur products generally have a one- or two-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects and workmanship. We estimate the future costs relating to product returns subject to our warranty and record a reserve upon shipment of our products. We periodically adjust our estimates for actual warranty claims, historical claims experience as well as the impact of the known product operational issues.\nWhile we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation can be affected by product, material and workmanship failures which may be outside of our control. If the actual factors leading to a product failure differ from management's assumptions, revisions to our estimated product warranty provision would be required and recorded to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) at the time of the change in estimate.\nPatent Litigation and Other Contingencies\nWe operate in an industry where there may be certain claims made against us related to patent infringement and other matters. We accrue for these claims whenever we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the liability is reasonably estimable. The amount of the accrual is estimated based on our review of each individual claim, including the type and facts of the claim and our assessment of the merits of the claim. Since these legal matters can be very complex and require significant judgement, we often utilize external legal counsel and other subject matter experts to assist us in defending against such claims. These accruals are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis and are adjusted to reflect the impact of recent negotiations, settlements, court rulings, advice from legal counsel and other events pertaining to the case. Although we believe that we take reasonable and considerable measures to mitigate our exposure in these matters, the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable. Nonetheless, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to pending legal matters against us as well as adequate provisions for probable and estimable losses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method when accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect\non deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Valuation allowances are provided against tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. In assessing valuation allowances, we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors, including cumulative earnings experience, expectations of future taxable income by jurisdiction, and the carryforward periods available for income tax purposes. We make estimates, assumptions and judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. In relation to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, allowed companies to record provisional amounts related to the tax effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act in 2018, and no material adjustments were required to the provisional amounts initially recorded on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the aggregate fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and labilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. We determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information, including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and other estimates made by management. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date impacting the asset valuations and liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, these estimates are uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, the impact of any subsequent adjustments is included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).\nGoodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt February 28, 2019, we had $80.8 million in goodwill and $47.2 million in other net intangible assets, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and consists primarily of goodwill from the LoJack acquisitions. Goodwill has been allocated to each of our two operating segments, which also represent our reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized but we perform an annual qualitative assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or at other reporting periods within the fiscal year as may be required, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in our stock price, significant differences in our forecasts compared to actual results, changes in our business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If further testing is required, we perform a two-step process. The first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the purpose of impairment testing, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units to be higher than the book value as of February 28, 2019. As a result, we have determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill for all periods presented.\nAcquired intangible assets with definite lives consist primarily of asset acquired in the LoJack acquisition, including tradenames, dealer relationships and developed technology and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products, technologies or relationships. We review our definite lived long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the lowest level of asset group is expected to generate. Given the interdependencies of revenues across our segments, product and service verticals and geographies, our asset groups are generally our two operating segments. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. There has been no impairment of long-lived assets for any periods presented.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nWe assess whether there are indicators that the value of our equity method investments may be impaired. An impairment charge is recognized only if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below our carrying value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of impairment is highly subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about our intent and ability to recover our investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment, including the level of our involvement therein, among other factors. To the extent an impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Impairment losses are included in Impairment loss and equity in net loss affiliate.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nOur stock-based compensation expense results from grants of employee and non-employee equity awards and is recognized in our consolidated financial statements based on the respective grant date fair values of the awards. The measurement of stock-based compensation expense is based on several criteria, including the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate. We recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis for our graded-vesting awards. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. However, the cumulative compensation expense recognized at any point in time must at least equal the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If any of these assumptions used in the valuation model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards could differ materially from the previously granted equity awards.\nForward Looking Statements\nForward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions, projections and other information regarding future performance, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

connectivity solutions and data intelligence for industrial machines, vehicles, drivers, and assets. \n- They operate in two segments: Telematics Systems and Software & Subscription Services.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Revenue decreased slightly (0.6%) in fiscal 2019 compared to 2018, with a decline in Telematics Systems revenue partially offset by growth in Software & Subscription Services.\n- Gross margin decreased from 41.2% to 40.6% due to lower Telematics Systems revenue and higher inventory charges. \n- Operating expenses decreased due to a large decline in general and administrative costs, partially offset by $8M in restructuring costs.\n- Net income improved from $16.6M to $18.4M due to operating income growth, higher investment income, and lower taxes.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- CalAmp issued $230M in convertible notes in July 2018 and used $90M of proceeds to repurchase shares and existing convertible notes.\n- Cash flows from operations were $47.7M. Key sources were net income, non-cash expenses, and working capital changes.  \n- Cash was used for acquisitions, working capital, capex, and investments in affiliates.\n\nConclusion\n- Revenue declined slightly but net income improved in 2019. Liquidity remains strong after the convertible note issuance. Priorities for cash use include acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt reduction.\n\n</td> </tr> </table>"}
