MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.\nOverview\nWe are a bank holding company, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, that through our community banking subsidiary, MidSouth Bank, N.A., operates 42 offices in Louisiana and Texas. We had approximately $1.7 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2018. We derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest. Interest-bearing deposits represent 73.6% of our total deposits. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The resulting ratio of that difference as a percentage of our average earning assets represents our net interest margin. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers. We have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income, as well as of our noninterest expense.\nThere are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period. We have included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses.\nThe economy in a large portion of our market areas is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. Over the past several years, we have experienced sustained low oil and gas prices that has led to an increase in our classified assets. While most of our customers are not directly involved in oil and gas exploration, many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities and are therefore indirectly impacted by low commodity prices. In addition, these adverse developments in the oil and gas industry have had negative effects on the economies of our market areas in general, including adverse effects on commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. The oil and gas industry, especially in Louisiana and Texas, has historically been subject to significant volatility, and these market areas have experienced a slower recovery from this current economic cycle which has adversely impacted the Bank's customers and their ability to recover from this downturn. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $112.6 million in loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry representing approximately 12.5% of our total loans outstanding as of that date, which represents a reduction of\u2009 $67.1 million of these types of loans, or 37.3%, since December 31, 2017, and we continue to make efforts to reduce our concentrations in these loans.\nThe Company and the Bank have both been placed in troubled condition by their respective federal banking regulators. The Bank has also entered into a written agreement with the OCC and has also been issued a Consent Order by the OCC. These designations, the written agreement and the Consent Order subject us to significant restrictions and will require us to designate a significant amount of resources to comply. See Part I, Item 1 under the heading Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Matters\u201d for additional information.\nThe following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n- 33 -\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The accounting principles we follow and the methods of applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and general banking practices. Our most critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments. The determination of the adequacy of the allowance involves significant judgment and complexity and is based on many factors. If the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required. See Asset Quality - Allowance for Loan Losses and Note 1 and Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAnother of our critical accounting policies relates to the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting adjustments. We account for acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic No. 805, which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, we are required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, including intangible assets. Determination of fair value involves estimates based on internal valuations of discounted cash flow analyses performed, third party valuations, or other valuation techniques that involve subjective assumptions. Additionally, the term of the useful lives and appropriate amortization periods of intangible assets is subjective. Resulting goodwill from an acquisition under the purchase method of accounting represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if deemed necessary. If the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, no charge to goodwill is made. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset, goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings. In evaluating the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for impairment at December 31, 2018, we first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is less than the carrying amount of the acquired assets, as allowed under ASU 2011-08, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. After making the assessment based on several factors, which included but was not limited to the current economic environment, the economic outlook in our markets, our financial performance and common stock value as compared to our peers, we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, no impairment of goodwill was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGiven the instability of the economic environment, it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses and goodwill impairment could change in the near-term or could result in impairment going forward.\nAnother of our critical accounting policies relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities. We record deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carry forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities results in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets is required. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. A deferred tax liability is not recognized for portions of the allowance for loan losses for income tax purposes in excess of the financial statement balance. Such a deferred tax liability will only be recognized when it becomes apparent that those temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent more likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not\u201d test, no tax benefit is recorded.\n- 34 -\nYield Analysis\nNet loss available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $30.8 million compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. A loss of $1.85 per diluted common share was reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to diluted loss per common share of $1.06 for 2017. The 2018 net loss included $49,000 of loss on sales of securities, $19.7 million of regulatory remediation costs, $145,000 of charges related to branch closure expenses, and a $987,000 loan held-for-sale expense, offset by $726,000 in discount accretion acceleration. A $13.5 million decrease in provision for loan losses was partially offset by a $8.6 million increase in income tax expense for 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe following table shows the relationship between interest revenue and expense and the average balances of interest-earning assets are interest-bearing liabilities as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td>

Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities , other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposit in other banks. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings and subordinated deferrable interest debentures.\n- 35 -\nOur primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest greatly affect net interest income. For 2018 and 2017 our net interest spread was 3.87% and 4.11% , respectively, while the net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.08% and 4.25%.\nNet interest income was $68.0 million in 2018, a decrease of $6.6 million or 8.8%, from 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2018 decreased $7.1 million, or 9.4%, from 2017.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2018 decreased $95.9 million, or 5.4%, from 2017, due primarily to the decrease in loans offset by the increase in time and interest-bearing deposits at other banks. Average loans decreased $197.1 million, from 2017, while the yield on loans increased 24 basis points, reflecting the effect of rising interest rates on the floating rate loans in the portfolio. Average time and interest-bearing deposits at other banks increased $125.6 million while the yield on these deposits also increased 10 basis points.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 decreased $98.2 million, or 7.8%, from the prior year, due to the decline in deposits and securities under agreement to repurchase. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for 2018 was 0.55% compared to 0.37% for 2017, reflecting a higher average rate on interest-bearing deposits.\nThe following table shows the relative effect on net interest revenue resulting from changes in the average outstanding balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid by the Company on such assets and liabilities (in thousands).\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Credit card income remained stable at $1.5 million. Other noninterest income decreased $402,000 in 2018. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to a $669,000 decrease in mortgage lending income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Our largest noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits totaled $32.3 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 4.7% as of December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The number of employees on a full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") basis increased by 7 during 2018, from 467 at year end 2017 to 474 at year end 2018.\n- 38 -\nAt December 31, 2018, occupancy expense totaled $12.5 million, a decrease of $3.2 million or 20.2% compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the closure and sale of 9 branches in 2017 resulting in fewer branches in 2018 to service.\nAt December 31, 2018, legal and professional fees totaled $8.8 million, an increase of $5.5 million or 164.8% compared to the same period in 2017. The increase during the year is primarily a result of management's initiative to address and comply with the terms of the written regulatory order which includes the increased need for outside legal and professional assistance.\nAt December 31, 2018, regulatory remediation costs totaled $19.7 million, an increase of $17.1 million or 650.4% from the same period in 2017. The increase is related to consulting and outsourcing costs for assistance with addressing and complying with the terms of the written regulatory order.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $8.6 million in 2018. The increase is a result of the Company recording a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $11.1 million as of December 31, 2018. Our effective tax rate approximated (27.7%) and 18.1% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by the adjustment of our net deferred tax assets related to the temporary establishment of a valuations allowance to fully reserve against deferred tax assets. The impact of nontaxable municipal interest income and other tax considerations also contributed to lower effective tax rates for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n-

The decrease was primarily a result of our continued focus on reducing our nonperforming loans. One such effort is our intention to sell a portion of these nonperforming loans through a bulk loan sale which was the main source of our net charge-offs of $26.2 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $27.7 million the same period 2017.\nOur loan portfolio is diversified throughout our Louisiana and Texas markets, with a focus on Commercial & Industrial (\"C&I\") as well as Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") loans. The C&I portfolio consists primarily of term loans or revolving lines of credit. The term loans are generally fixed rates and have maturities of three to five years. The CRE portfolio consists primarily of three to five year fixed rate maturities with fifteen to twenty year amortization terms.\nThe Company strives to maintain a diversified loan portfolio across our footprint within various loan types. At December 31, 2018, our concentration within the oil and gas portfolio aggregated to more than 10% of our total loan portfolio. We define an energy loan as any loan where the borrower's ability to repay is disproportionately impacted by a prolonged downturn in energy prices. Under this definition, the Bank includes direct C&I loans to energy borrowers, as well as CRE loans, Residential Real Estate loans and loans to energy-related borrowers where the loan's primary collateral is cash and marketable securities. Although this definition has resulted in a lack of comparability with some other energy-related banks, management believes it to be the\n- 41 -\nprudent approach to monitoring and managing the Bank's energy exposure. Our exposure in the oil and gas industry, as defined above, totaled approximately $112.6 million, or 12.5% of total loans. The average loan size is approximately $377,000, and the average loan size per relationship is roughly $500,000. Of the $112.6 million loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry, $4.3 million or 3.8% were on nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018, with $2.1 million being included in nonperforming loans held for sale. We are closely monitoring the effects of the sustained decline in energy prices on our energy related loan portfolio. We continue to communicate with our customers who provide valuable insight on the present energy cycle. The energy reserve as a percentage of total energy loans was 3.2% at December 31, 2018.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table presents information on nonperforming assets, including loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans on nonaccrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets repossessed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troubled debt restructurings, accruing (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans to total loans + ORE + other foreclosed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL to nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Does not include $8.6 million, $25.1 million, $20.9 million, and $234,000 of TDRs reported in nonaccrual loans at, December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were not any TDRs on nonaccrual staus at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, nonperforming assets totaled $30.5 million, a decrease of $26.8 million compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from a $40.4 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, which was partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in nonperforming loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018. Troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") totaled $1.3 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in management's judgment, the collection of principal or interest income is doubtful. Past due loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. Our policy provides that unsecured retail (consumer) loans that become 90 days delinquent be routinely charged off. Loans classified for regulatory purposes but not included in the table above do not represent material amounts that we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with loan repayment terms. Further information regarding our loan policy is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 42 -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly in accordance with GAAP and regulatory guidelines and includes a review of the loan portfolio, with particular emphasis on non-accruing, past due and other loans management believes may warrant additional attention. The loan portfolio is segregated based on loan type as a way to evaluate exposures to risks with the loan portfolio. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is a combination of specific allowances for identified problem loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. There are certain loans that are individually reviewed when it is determined by management that the general allocation is not sufficient to appropriately capture potential inherent weaknesses that may expose the Bank to loss. In these instances, we establish a specific allowance to those loans determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. We establish a general allowance for smaller balance, homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics of for which have not been specifically reviewed for probable incurred losses. We evaluate loss factors by taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative components impacting our probable incurred losses. These components include, but are not limited to historical charge-offs; known deterioration in concentrations of credit; trends in nonperforming assets; volume, maturity and composition of the loan portfolio; off-balance sheet credit risk; lending policies and control systems; national and local economic conditions; the experience, ability and depth of lending management; and the results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies and others.\nOur allowance for loan losses totaled $17.4 million and $26.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $33.4 million to $383.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and represented 26.4% of total deposits when compared to the same period in 2017. During 2018, money market and savings accounts increased $42.0 million and NOW accounts decreased $34.0 million, to $488.2 million and $400.6 million, respectively compared to the same period in 2017. Time deposits, which are comprised mostly of certificates of deposits ( CDs\u201d), decreased $2.2 million to $180.1 million in 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in total deposits during 2017 resulted primarily from decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW accounts of $67.4 million partially offset by an increase of $42.0 million in savings and money market accounts. Core deposits, defined as all deposits other than time deposits, remained strong at 87.6% of total deposits at year-end 2018 compared to 87.7% of total deposits at year-end 2017.\nThe following table presents the average amount of deposits classes and average rates paid on deposits for the years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings, NOW, and money market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>952,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,014,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,506,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,544,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,567,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 44 -\nThe following table presents the maturity schedule for time deposits of $250,000 or more for the years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2018 securities sold under repurchase agreements totaled $11.2 million, a decrease of $55.9 million or 83.3% compared to the same period in 2017.

Additional information regarding long-term debt is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Regulations adopted as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in changes to the regulatory capital treatment of securities similar to our debentures. However, because of the issue date of our debentures and our asset size, we are allowed to continue to include the debentures in our Tier 1 capital.\nIn 2018 and 2017 we did not have an average balance in any category of short-term borrowings including retail repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, or FRB discount window that exceeded 30% of our stockholders' equity for such year.\nCapital\nWe are required to maintain certain minimum capital levels for the Company and the Bank. Risk-based capital requirements are intended to make regulatory capital more sensitive to the risk profile of an institution's assets. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implement the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital, increase risk-based capital requirements, and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. Details regarding the final rule and changes to capital requirements and prompt corrective action thresholds are included under Part I, Item 1 - Business, Supervision and Regulation. The final rules became effective as of January 1, 2015, for most banking organizations including the Company and the Bank, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the final rules, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, which became fully implemented as of January 1, 2019. Requirements to maintain higher levels\n- 45 -\nof capital could adversely impact our return on equity. We believe we will continue to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements under these new rules on a fully phased-in basis.\nThe payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is restricted by various regulatory and statutory limitations. As a result of the loss reported for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank does not have the ability to approve dividends to the Company without prior approval from the OCC. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $44.8 million of cash to fund general corporate obligations.\nIn connection with the SBLF transaction, the Company issued $32.0 million in Series B Preferred Stock to the Treasury. The dividend rate was set at 1.00% for the fourth quarter of 2013 due to attaining the target 10% growth rate in qualified small business loans during the second quarter of 2013. As a result of qualified small business loan growth as of September 30, 2013, the dividend rate was set at 1.00% for the period from January 1, 2014 through February 25, 2016. On February 25, 2016, the dividend rate increased to 9% per annum.\nOn June 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale of 4,583,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering, and on July 11, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an additional 516,700 shares of common stock, pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. After deducting the underwriting discount and costs associated with the capital raise, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $57.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with statutory minimum capital requirements. Minimum capital requirements include a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, with Tier 1 capital not less than 6.0%, common equity Tier 1 capital not less than 4.5% and a leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total average adjusted assets) of 4.0% based upon the regulators latest composite rating of the institution. In addition, the OCC has established higher individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank. Specifically, the Bank must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's leverage ratio was 11.45% compared to 12.53% at December 31, 2017. Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 17.79% and 16.51% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total capital to risk weighted assets was 19.04% and 17.77%, respectively, for the same periods. Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 12.20% and 12.10%, respectively, for the same periods. For regulatory purposes, Tier 1 Capital includes $21.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. For financial reporting purposes, these funds are included as a liability under GAAP. The Bank's leverage ratio was 9.11% and 9.86% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 established a capital-based supervisory system for all insured depository institutions that imposes increasing restrictions on the institution as its capital deteriorates. The Bank was classified as well capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2018.\nAsset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in market rates of interest. The primary objective of our asset and liability management process is to evaluate interest rate sensitivity inherent in our balance sheet components and establish guidelines to manage that risk within acceptable performance levels. Management and our Board of Directors are responsible for determining the appropriate level of acceptable risk based on our strategic focus, regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity, and the market environment. Our Board of Directors established an Asset/Liability management committee ( ALCO\u201d), comprised of certain executive and senior officers of the Bank, to measure and monitor interest rate risk within defined parameters. We utilize an external model for asset and liability management from our core processor. The model captures data directly from our operating system along with additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing, cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time periods.\nThis data, combined with additional assumptions including repricing rates and payment characteristics, were used to perform instantaneous parallel rate shift, gradual parallel rate shift, and alternate rate shift simulations. Instantaneous parallel rate shifts are known as rate shocks\u201d because all rates are modeled to change instantaneously by the indicated shock amount. Gradual parallel rate shifts are called \"Ramps\" and reflect incremental rate increases over a 12 month period. Alternate rate shifts include floor rates that generally provide more realistic projections of changes in net interest income and market risk, although given the current low rate environment deposits costs are overstated in a down 100 basis point scenario as the model does not currently allow for negative interest rates. Results of the simulations were compared to a base case scenario that provided projected net interest income over the next 12 months with no change in the balance sheet. The estimated percentage changes in projected net interest income due to changes in interest rates of alternate down 100 basis points, ramp up 100, parallel up 200, and up 300\n- 46 -\nbasis points as determined through the simulations are detailed below. At December 31, 2018, the interest rate risk model results were within policy guidelines and indicated that our balance sheet is slightly liability sensitive over a one year period. The results of the interest rate risk modeling are reviewed by ALCO and discussed quarterly at Funds Management committee meetings of our Board of Directors. The model captures data directly from our operating system along with additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing, cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time periods. As a result of an independent non-maturity deposit study commissioned in 2016, we updated our deposit beta assumptions, which are correlation assumptions between deposit rates and market rates, in rising rate scenarios on a consolidated basis from 40% to 60%. The actual deposit betas experienced in a rising rate scenario could be materially different from those assumed in the model, and therefore actual net income could be materially different from estimated net interest income indicated in the table below.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income at Risk in Year 1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase / Decrease\nin NII at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shock Up 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.12)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shock Up 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.15)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ramp Up 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.84)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alternate Down 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.31)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nBank Liquidity\nLiquidity is the availability of funds to meet maturing contractual obligations and to fund operations. The Bank's primary liquidity needs involve its ability to accommodate customers' demands for deposit withdrawals as well as customers' requests for credit. Liquidity is deemed adequate when sufficient cash to meet these needs can be promptly raised at a reasonable cost to the Bank.\nLiquidity is provided primarily by three sources: a stable base of funding sources, an adequate level of assets that can be readily converted into cash, and borrowing lines with correspondent banks. Our core deposits are our most stable and important source of funding. Cash deposits at other banks, federal funds sold, and principal payments received on loans and mortgage-backed securities provide additional primary sources of liquidity. Approximately $66.2 million in projected cash flows from securities repayments during 2019 provides an additional source of liquidity.\nThe Bank also has significant borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (\"FRB\") and with the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\"). As of December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings with the FRB. FHLB advances totaled $27.5 million at December 31, 2018 and consisted of a two fixed rate advances that matures in January 2019 and bears a fixed interest rate of 2.66%. The Bank has the ability to post additional collateral of approximately $210.6 million if necessary to meet liquidity needs. Additionally, $302.6 million in loan collateral is pledged under a Borrower-in-Custody line with the FRB. Under existing agreements with the FHLB, our borrowing capacity totaled $275.1 million at December 31, 2018. Additional unsecured borrowing lines totaling $30.0 million are available through correspondent banks. We utilize these contingency funding alternatives to meet deposit volatility, which is more likely in the current environment, given unusual competitive offerings within our markets.\nCompany Liquidity\nOn June 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale of 4,583,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering, and on July 11, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an additional 516,700 shares of common stock, pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. After deducting the underwriting discount and costs associated with the capital raise, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $57.2 million. The Company, subject to regulatory approval, intends to use $32.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a result of its participation in the SBLF. The Company intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds to enhance its capital structure, to fund future organic growth, for working capital, and other general corporate purposes.\n- 47 -\nAt the Company level, cash is needed primarily to meet interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures, dividend payments on the Series B and Series C Preferred Stock and dividends on the common stock. We issued $8,248,000 in unsecured junior subordinated debentures in September 2004 and $7,217,000 in February 2001. In August 2014, we paid off the $7.2 million junior subordinated debenture. In December 2012, we acquired $13.9 million in unsecured junior subordinated debentures from PSB Financial Corporation. The terms of the junior subordinated debentures are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Dividends from the Bank totaling $4,000,000 provided additional liquidity prior to the capital raise in 2017 for the Company to meet interest and dividend payments. Due to the loss reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, we currently do not have the ability to approve dividends from the Bank to the Company without prior approval from the OCC. At December 31, 2018, the parent company had approximately $44.1 million cash available for general corporate purposes, including injecting capital into the Bank.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which included commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, totaled $261.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nThose instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the Company's involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe Company's exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies, including considerations of collateral requirements, in making these commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, presented herein, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. For additional information, see Funding Sources - Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain financial information included in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. The table below presents a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net loss\u201d and adjusted diluted loss per share\u201d. Adjusted net loss\u201d is defined as net loss available to common shareholders less tax-effected nonoperating income and expense items, including securities gains/losses. Adjusted Diluted loss per share\u201d is defined as net loss available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by diluted weighted-average shares.\nWe use non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for evaluating our financial condition and performance over periods of time, as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our performance. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial condition as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that other companies may use.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP are included in the table below (in thousands except per share data).\n- 48 -\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss available to common shareholders'\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory remediation costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans resolution expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and retention expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branch closure expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount accretion acceleration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After tax adjustment items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax expense adjustment items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Attributable to valuation allowance on deferred tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Attributable to remeasurement of deferred taxes at reduced federal corporate tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of shares -

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.\nOverview\nWe are a bank holding company, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, that through our community banking subsidiary, MidSouth Bank, N.A., operates 42 offices in Louisiana and Texas. We had approximately $1.7 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2018. We derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest. Interest-bearing deposits represent 73.6% of our total deposits. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The resulting ratio of that difference as a percentage of our average earning assets represents our net interest margin. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers. We have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income, as well as of our noninterest expense.\nThere are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period. We have included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses.\nThe economy in a large portion of our market areas is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. Over the past several years, we have experienced sustained low oil and gas prices that has led to an increase in our classified assets. While most of our customers are not directly involved in oil and gas exploration, many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities and are therefore indirectly impacted by low commodity prices. In addition, these adverse developments in the oil and gas industry have had negative effects on the economies of our market areas in general, including adverse effects on commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. The oil and gas industry, especially in Louisiana and Texas, has historically been subject to significant volatility, and these market areas have experienced a slower recovery from this current economic cycle which has adversely impacted the Bank's customers and their ability to recover from this downturn. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $112.6 million in loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry representing approximately 12.5% of our total loans outstanding as of that date, which represents a reduction of\u2009 $67.1 million of these types of loans, or 37.3%, since December 31, 2017, and we continue to make efforts to reduce our concentrations in these loans.\nThe Company and the Bank have both been placed in troubled condition by their respective federal banking regulators. The Bank has also entered into a written agreement with the OCC and has also been issued a Consent Order by the OCC. These designations, the written agreement and the Consent Order subject us to significant restrictions and will require us to designate a significant amount of resources to comply. See Part I, Item 1 under the heading Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Matters\u201d for additional information.\nThe following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n- 33 -\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The accounting principles we follow and the methods of applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and general banking practices. Our most critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments. The determination of the adequacy of the allowance involves significant judgment and complexity and is based on many factors. If the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required. See Asset Quality - Allowance for Loan Losses and Note 1 and Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAnother of our critical accounting policies relates to the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting adjustments. We account for acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic No. 805, which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, we are required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, including intangible assets. Determination of fair value involves estimates based on internal valuations of discounted cash flow analyses performed, third party valuations, or other valuation techniques that involve subjective assumptions. Additionally, the term of the useful lives and appropriate amortization periods of intangible assets is subjective. Resulting goodwill from an acquisition under the purchase method of accounting represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if deemed necessary. If the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, no charge to goodwill is made. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset, goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings. In evaluating the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for impairment at December 31, 2018, we first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is less than the carrying amount of the acquired assets, as allowed under ASU 2011-08, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. After making the assessment based on several factors, which included but was not limited to the current economic environment, the economic outlook in our markets, our financial performance and common stock value as compared to our peers, we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, no impairment of goodwill was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGiven the instability of the economic environment, it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses and goodwill impairment could change in the near-term or could result in impairment going forward.\nAnother of our critical accounting policies relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities. We record deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carry forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities results in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets is required. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. A deferred tax liability is not recognized for portions of the allowance for loan losses for income tax purposes in excess of the financial statement balance. Such a deferred tax liability will only be recognized when it becomes apparent that those temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent more likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not\u201d test, no tax benefit is recorded.\n- 34 -\nYield Analysis\nNet loss available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $30.8 million compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. A loss of $1.85 per diluted common share was reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to diluted loss per common share of $1.06 for 2017. The 2018 net loss included $49,000 of loss on sales of securities, $19.7 million of regulatory remediation costs, $145,000 of charges related to branch closure expenses, and a $987,000 loan held-for-sale expense, offset by $726,000 in discount accretion acceleration. A $13.5 million decrease in provision for loan losses was partially offset by a $8.6 million increase in income tax expense for 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe following table shows the relationship between interest revenue and expense and the average balances of interest-earning assets are interest-bearing liabilities as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td>

Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities , other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposit in other banks. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings and subordinated deferrable interest debentures.\n- 35 -\nOur primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest greatly affect net interest income. For 2018 and 2017 our net interest spread was 3.87% and 4.11% , respectively, while the net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.08% and 4.25%.\nNet interest income was $68.0 million in 2018, a decrease of $6.6 million or 8.8%, from 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2018 decreased $7.1 million, or 9.4%, from 2017.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2018 decreased $95.9 million, or 5.4%, from 2017, due primarily to the decrease in loans offset by the increase in time and interest-bearing deposits at other banks. Average loans decreased $197.1 million, from 2017, while the yield on loans increased 24 basis points, reflecting the effect of rising interest rates on the floating rate loans in the portfolio. Average time and interest-bearing deposits at other banks increased $125.6 million while the yield on these deposits also increased 10 basis points.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 decreased $98.2 million, or 7.8%, from the prior year, due to the decline in deposits and securities under agreement to repurchase. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for 2018 was 0.55% compared to 0.37% for 2017, reflecting a higher average rate on interest-bearing deposits.\nThe following table shows the relative effect on net interest revenue resulting from changes in the average outstanding balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid by the Company on such assets and liabilities (in thousands).\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase is related to consulting and outsourcing costs for assistance with addressing and complying with the terms of the written regulatory order.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $8.6 million in 2018. The increase is a result of the Company recording a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $11.1 million as of December 31, 2018. Our effective tax rate approximated (27.7%) and 18.1% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by the adjustment of our net deferred tax assets related to the temporary establishment of a valuations allowance to fully reserve against deferred tax assets. The impact of nontaxable municipal interest income and other tax considerations also contributed to lower effective tax rates for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n-

while providing a relatively stable source of revenue. The investment securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk in other categories of the balance sheet, while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowings, including repurchase agreements.

The decrease was primarily a result of our continued focus on reducing our nonperforming loans. One such effort is our intention to sell a portion of these nonperforming loans through a bulk loan sale which was the main source of our net charge-offs of $26.2 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $27.7 million the same period 2017.\nOur loan portfolio is diversified throughout our Louisiana and Texas markets, with a focus on Commercial & Industrial (\"C&I\") as well as Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") loans. The C&I portfolio consists primarily of term loans or revolving lines of credit. The term loans are generally fixed rates and have maturities of three to five years. The CRE portfolio consists primarily of three to five year fixed rate maturities with fifteen to twenty year amortization terms.\nThe Company strives to maintain a diversified loan portfolio across our footprint within various loan types. At December 31, 2018, our concentration within the oil and gas portfolio aggregated to more than 10% of our total loan portfolio. We define an energy loan as any loan where the borrower's ability to repay is disproportionately impacted by a prolonged downturn in energy prices. Under this definition, the Bank includes direct C&I loans to energy borrowers, as well as CRE loans, Residential Real Estate loans and loans to energy-related borrowers where the loan's primary collateral is cash and marketable securities. Although this definition has resulted in a lack of comparability with some other energy-related banks, management believes it to be the\n- 41 -\nprudent approach to monitoring and managing the Bank's energy exposure. Our exposure in the oil and gas industry, as defined above, totaled approximately $112.6 million, or 12.5% of total loans. The average loan size is approximately $377,000, and the average loan size per relationship is roughly $500,000. Of the $112.6 million loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry, $4.3 million or 3.8% were on nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018, with $2.1 million being included in nonperforming loans held for sale. We are closely monitoring the effects of the sustained decline in energy prices on our energy related loan portfolio. We continue to communicate with our customers who provide valuable insight on the present energy cycle. The energy reserve as a percentage of total energy loans was 3.2% at December 31, 2018.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table presents information on nonperforming assets, including loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans on nonaccrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets repossessed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troubled debt restructurings, accruing (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans to total loans + ORE + other foreclosed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming assets to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL to nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL to total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Does not include $8.6 million, $25.1 million, $20.9 million, and $234,000 of TDRs reported in nonaccrual loans at, December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were not any TDRs on nonaccrual staus at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, nonperforming assets totaled $30.5 million, a decrease of $26.8 million compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from a $40.4 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, which was partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in nonperforming loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018. Troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") totaled $1.3 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in management's judgment, the collection of principal or interest income is doubtful. Past due loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. Our policy provides that unsecured retail (consumer) loans that become 90 days delinquent be routinely charged off. Loans classified for regulatory purposes but not included in the table above do not represent material amounts that we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with loan repayment terms. Further information regarding our loan policy is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 42 -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly in accordance with GAAP and regulatory guidelines and includes a review of the loan portfolio, with particular emphasis on non-accruing, past due and other loans management believes may warrant additional attention. The loan portfolio is segregated based on loan type as a way to evaluate exposures to risks with the loan portfolio. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is a combination of specific allowances for identified problem loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. There are certain loans that are individually reviewed when it is determined by management that the general allocation is not sufficient to appropriately capture potential inherent weaknesses that may expose the Bank to loss. In these instances, we establish a specific allowance to those loans determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. We establish a general allowance for smaller balance, homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics of for which have not been specifically reviewed for probable incurred losses. We evaluate loss factors by taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative components impacting our probable incurred losses. These components include, but are not limited to historical charge-offs; known deterioration in concentrations of credit; trends in nonperforming assets; volume, maturity and composition of the loan portfolio; off-balance sheet credit risk; lending policies and control systems; national and local economic conditions; the experience, ability and depth of lending management; and the results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies and others.\nOur allowance for loan losses totaled $17.4 million and $26.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

During 2018, money market and savings accounts increased $42.0 million and NOW accounts decreased $34.0 million, to $488.2 million and $400.6 million, respectively compared to the same period in 2017. Time deposits, which are comprised mostly of certificates of deposits ( CDs\u201d), decreased $2.2 million to $180.1 million in 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in total deposits during 2017 resulted primarily from decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW accounts of $67.4 million partially offset by an increase of $42.0 million in savings and money market accounts. Core deposits, defined as all deposits other than time deposits, remained strong at 87.6% of total deposits at year-end 2018 compared to 87.7% of total deposits at year-end 2017.\nThe following table presents the average amount of deposits classes and average rates paid on deposits for the years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings, NOW, and money market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>952,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,014,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,506,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,544,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,567,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 44 -\nThe following table presents the maturity schedule for time deposits of $250,000 or more for the years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2018 securities sold under repurchase agreements totaled $11.2 million, a decrease of $55.9 million or 83.3% compared to the same period in 2017. Since the Bank's introduction of Promontory' s Insured Cash Sweep\u00ae (\"ICS\") product in 2018, we have migrated most of our commercial repurchase agreement relationships to this product. The ICS product is classified as \"deposits\" and does not require pledging of collateral,which management believes helps to improve our liquidity.\nFHLB advances totaled $27.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2017. The FHLB advances at December 31, 2018 consisted of two FHLB advances with maturities of 1 month at a fixed interest rate of 2.66%. The FHLB advances at December 31, 2017 consisted of two FHLB advances with maturities of 1 month at a fixed interest rate of 1.59% and one advance maturing January 2019 bearing a fixed interest rate of 1.985%. This advance was terminated in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe following table presents junior subordinated debentures outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands).\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Date Issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Callable After\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 31, 2001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 9, 2031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 month LIBOR plus 3.30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 31, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 20, 2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 20, 2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 month LIBOR plus 2.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 20, 2009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 12, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 12, 2036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 month LIBOR plus 1.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 26, 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 21, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 21, 2037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 month LIBOR plus 1.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 15, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur outstanding debentures currently qualify as Tier 1 capital and are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as junior subordinated debentures. Additional information regarding long-term debt is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Regulations adopted as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in changes to the regulatory capital treatment of securities similar to our debentures. However, because of the issue date of our debentures and our asset size, we are allowed to continue to include the debentures in our Tier 1 capital.\nIn 2018 and 2017 we did not have an average balance in any category of short-term borrowings including retail repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, or FRB discount window that exceeded 30% of our stockholders' equity for such year.\nCapital\nWe are required to maintain certain minimum capital levels for the Company and the Bank. Risk-based capital requirements are intended to make regulatory capital more sensitive to the risk profile of an institution's assets. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implement the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital, increase risk-based capital requirements, and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. Details regarding the final rule and changes to capital requirements and prompt corrective action thresholds are included under Part I, Item 1 - Business, Supervision and Regulation. The final rules became effective as of January 1, 2015, for most banking organizations including the Company and the Bank, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the final rules, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, which became fully implemented as of January 1, 2019. Requirements to maintain higher levels\n- 45 -\nof capital could adversely impact our return on equity. We believe we will continue to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements under these new rules on a fully phased-in basis.\nThe payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is restricted by various regulatory and statutory limitations. As a result of the loss reported for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank does not have the ability to approve dividends to the Company without prior approval from the OCC. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $44.8 million of cash to fund general corporate obligations.\nIn connection with the SBLF transaction, the Company issued $32.0 million in Series B Preferred Stock to the Treasury. The dividend rate was set at 1.00% for the fourth quarter of 2013 due to attaining the target 10% growth rate in qualified small business loans during the second quarter of 2013. As a result of qualified small business loan growth as of September 30, 2013, the dividend rate was set at 1.00% for the period from January 1, 2014 through February 25, 2016. On February 25, 2016, the dividend rate increased to 9% per annum.\nOn June 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale of 4,583,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering, and on July 11, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an additional 516,700 shares of common stock, pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. After deducting the underwriting discount and costs associated with the capital raise, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $57.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with statutory minimum capital requirements. Minimum capital requirements include a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, with Tier 1 capital not less than 6.0%, common equity Tier 1 capital not less than 4.5% and a leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total average adjusted assets) of 4.0% based upon the regulators latest composite rating of the institution. In addition, the OCC has established higher individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank. Specifically, the Bank must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's leverage ratio was 11.45% compared to 12.53% at December 31, 2017. Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 17.79% and 16.51% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total capital to risk weighted assets was 19.04% and 17.77%, respectively, for the same periods. Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 12.20% and 12.10%, respectively, for the same periods. For regulatory purposes, Tier 1 Capital includes $21.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. For financial reporting purposes, these funds are included as a liability under GAAP. The Bank's leverage ratio was 9.11% and 9.86% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 established a capital-based supervisory system for all insured depository institutions that imposes increasing restrictions on the institution as its capital deteriorates. The Bank was classified as well capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2018.\nAsset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in market rates of interest. The primary objective of our asset and liability management process is to evaluate interest rate sensitivity inherent in our balance sheet components and establish guidelines to manage that risk within acceptable performance levels. Management and our Board of Directors are responsible for determining the appropriate level of acceptable risk based on our strategic focus, regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity, and the market environment. Our Board of Directors established an Asset/Liability management committee ( ALCO\u201d), comprised of certain executive and senior officers of the Bank, to measure and monitor interest rate risk within defined parameters. We utilize an external model for asset and liability management from our core processor. The model captures data directly from our operating system along with additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing, cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time periods.\nThis data, combined with additional assumptions including repricing rates and payment characteristics, were used to perform instantaneous parallel rate shift, gradual parallel rate shift, and alternate rate shift simulations. Instantaneous parallel rate shifts are known as rate shocks\u201d because all rates are modeled to change instantaneously by the indicated shock amount. Gradual parallel rate shifts are called \"Ramps\" and reflect incremental rate increases over a 12 month period. Alternate rate shifts include floor rates that generally provide more realistic projections of changes in net interest income and market risk, although given the current low rate environment deposits costs are overstated in a down 100 basis point scenario as the model does not currently allow for negative interest rates. Results of the simulations were compared to a base case scenario that provided projected net interest income over the next 12 months with no change in the balance sheet. The estimated percentage changes in projected net interest income due to changes in interest rates of alternate down 100 basis points, ramp up 100, parallel up 200, and up 300\n- 46 -\nbasis points as determined through the simulations are detailed below. At December 31, 2018, the interest rate risk model results were within policy guidelines and indicated that our balance sheet is slightly liability sensitive over a one year period. The results of the interest rate risk modeling are reviewed by ALCO and discussed quarterly at Funds Management committee meetings of our Board of Directors. The model captures data directly from our operating system along with additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing, cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time periods. As a result of an independent non-maturity deposit study commissioned in 2016, we updated our deposit beta assumptions, which are correlation assumptions between deposit rates and market rates, in rising rate scenarios on a consolidated basis from 40% to 60%. The actual deposit betas experienced in a rising rate scenario could be materially different from those assumed in the model, and therefore actual net income could be materially different from estimated net interest income indicated in the table below.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income at Risk in Year 1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase / Decrease\nin NII at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shock Up 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.12)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shock Up 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.15)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ramp Up 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.84)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alternate Down 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.31)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nBank Liquidity\nLiquidity is the availability of funds to meet maturing contractual obligations and to fund operations. The Bank's primary liquidity needs involve its ability to accommodate customers' demands for deposit withdrawals as well as customers' requests for credit. Liquidity is deemed adequate when sufficient cash to meet these needs can be promptly raised at a reasonable cost to the Bank.\nLiquidity is provided primarily by three sources: a stable base of funding sources, an adequate level of assets that can be readily converted into cash, and borrowing lines with correspondent banks. Our core deposits are our most stable and important source of funding. Cash deposits at other banks, federal funds sold, and principal payments received on loans and mortgage-backed securities provide additional primary sources of liquidity. Approximately $66.2 million in projected cash flows from securities repayments during 2019 provides an additional source of liquidity.\nThe Bank also has significant borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (\"FRB\") and with the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\"). As of December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings with the FRB. FHLB advances totaled $27.5 million at December 31, 2018 and consisted of a two fixed rate advances that matures in January 2019 and bears a fixed interest rate of 2.66%. The Bank has the ability to post additional collateral of approximately $210.6 million if necessary to meet liquidity needs. Additionally, $302.6 million in loan collateral is pledged under a Borrower-in-Custody line with the FRB. Under existing agreements with the FHLB, our borrowing capacity totaled $275.1 million at December 31, 2018. Additional unsecured borrowing lines totaling $30.0 million are available through correspondent banks. We utilize these contingency funding alternatives to meet deposit volatility, which is more likely in the current environment, given unusual competitive offerings within our markets.\nCompany Liquidity\nOn June 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale of 4,583,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering, and on July 11, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an additional 516,700 shares of common stock, pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. After deducting the underwriting discount and costs associated with the capital raise, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $57.2 million. The Company, subject to regulatory approval, intends to use $32.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a result of its participation in the SBLF. The Company intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds to enhance its capital structure, to fund future organic growth, for working capital, and other general corporate purposes.\n- 47 -\nAt the Company level, cash is needed primarily to meet interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures, dividend payments on the Series B and Series C Preferred Stock and dividends on the common stock. We issued $8,248,000 in unsecured junior subordinated debentures in September 2004 and $7,217,000 in February 2001. In August 2014, we paid off the $7.2 million junior subordinated debenture. In December 2012, we acquired $13.9 million in unsecured junior subordinated debentures from PSB Financial Corporation. The terms of the junior subordinated debentures are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Dividends from the Bank totaling $4,000,000 provided additional liquidity prior to the capital raise in 2017 for the Company to meet interest and dividend payments. Due to the loss reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, we currently do not have the ability to approve dividends from the Bank to the Company without prior approval from the OCC. At December 31, 2018, the parent company had approximately $44.1 million cash available for general corporate purposes, including injecting capital into the Bank.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which included commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, totaled $261.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nThose instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the Company's involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe Company's exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies, including considerations of collateral requirements, in making these commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, presented herein, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. For additional information, see Funding Sources - Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain financial information included in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. The table below presents a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net loss\u201d and adjusted diluted loss per share\u201d. Adjusted net loss\u201d is defined as net loss available to common shareholders less tax-effected nonoperating income and expense items, including securities gains/losses. Adjusted Diluted loss per share\u201d is defined as net loss available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by diluted weighted-average shares.\nWe use non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for evaluating our financial condition and performance over periods of time, as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our performance. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial condition as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that other companies may use.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP are included in the table below (in thousands except per share data).\n- 48 -\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss available to common shareholders'\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory remediation costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans resolution expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and retention expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branch closure expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount accretion acceleration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After tax adjustment items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax expense adjustment items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Attributable to valuation allowance on deferred tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Attributable to remeasurement of deferred taxes at reduced federal corporate tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of shares -

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.\nOverview\nWe are a bank holding company, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, that through our community banking subsidiary, MidSouth Bank, N.A., operates 42 offices in Louisiana and Texas. We had approximately $1.7 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2018. We derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest. Interest-bearing deposits represent 73.6% of our total deposits. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The resulting ratio of that difference as a percentage of our average earning assets represents our net interest margin. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers. We have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income, as well as of our noninterest expense.\nThere are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period. We have included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses.\nThe economy in a large portion of our market areas is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. Over the past several years, we have experienced sustained low oil and gas prices that has led to an increase in our classified assets. While most of our customers are not directly involved in oil and gas exploration, many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities and are therefore indirectly impacted by low commodity prices. In addition, these adverse developments in the oil and gas industry have had negative effects on the economies of our market areas in general, including adverse effects on commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. The oil and gas industry, especially in Louisiana and Texas, has historically been subject to significant volatility, and these market areas have experienced a slower recovery from this current economic cycle which has adversely impacted the Bank's customers and their ability to recover from this downturn. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $112.6 million in loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry representing approximately 12.5% of our total loans outstanding as of that date, which represents a reduction of\u2009 $67.1 million of these types of loans, or 37.3%, since December 31, 2017, and we continue to make efforts to reduce our concentrations in these loans.\nThe Company and the Bank have both been placed in troubled condition by their respective federal banking regulators. The Bank has also entered into a written agreement with the OCC and has also been issued a Consent Order by the OCC. These designations, the written agreement and the Consent Order subject us to significant restrictions and will require us to designate a significant amount of resources to comply. See Part I, Item 1 under the heading Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Matters\u201d for additional information.\nThe following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n- 33 -\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The accounting principles we follow and the methods of applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and general banking practices. Our most critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments. The determination of the adequacy of the allowance involves significant judgment and complexity and is based on many factors. If the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required. See Asset Quality - Allowance for Loan Losses and Note 1 and Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAnother of our critical accounting policies relates to the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting adjustments. We account for acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic No. 805, which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, we are required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, including intangible assets. Determination of fair value involves estimates based on internal valuations of discounted cash flow analyses performed, third party valuations, or other valuation techniques that involve subjective assumptions. Additionally, the term of the useful lives and appropriate amortization periods of intangible assets is subjective. Resulting goodwill from an acquisition under the purchase method of accounting represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if deemed necessary. If the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, no charge to goodwill is made. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset, goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings. In evaluating the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for impairment at December 31, 2018, we first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is less than the carrying amount of the acquired assets, as allowed under ASU 2011-08, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. After making the assessment based on several factors, which included but was not limited to the current economic environment, the economic outlook in our markets, our financial performance and common stock value as compared to our peers, we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, no impairment of goodwill was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGiven the instability of the economic environment, it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses and goodwill impairment could change in the near-term or could result in impairment going forward.\nAnother of our critical accounting policies relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities. We record deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carry forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities results in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets is required. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. A deferred tax liability is not recognized for portions of the allowance for loan losses for income tax purposes in excess of the financial statement balance. Such a deferred tax liability will only be recognized when it becomes apparent that those temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent more likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not\u201d test, no tax benefit is recorded.\n- 34 -\nYield Analysis\nNet loss available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $30.8 million compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. A loss of $1.85 per diluted common share was reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to diluted loss per common share of $1.06 for 2017. The 2018 net loss included $49,000 of loss on sales of securities, $19.7 million of regulatory remediation costs, $145,000 of charges related to branch closure expenses, and a $987,000 loan held-for-sale expense, offset by $726,000 in discount accretion acceleration. A $13.5 million decrease in provision for loan losses was partially offset by a $8.6 million increase in income tax expense for 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe following table shows the relationship between interest revenue and expense and the average balances of interest-earning assets are interest-bearing liabilities as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\nEarnings Analysis\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest-earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities , other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposit in other banks. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings and subordinated deferrable interest debentures.\n- 35 -\nOur primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest greatly affect net interest income. For 2018 and 2017 our net interest spread was 3.87% and 4.11% , respectively, while the net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.08% and 4.25%.\nNet interest income was $68.0 million in 2018, a decrease of $6.6 million or 8.8%, from 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2018 decreased $7.1 million, or 9.4%, from 2017.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2018 decreased $95.9 million, or 5.4%, from 2017, due primarily to the decrease in loans offset by the increase in time and interest-bearing deposits at other banks. Average loans decreased $197.1 million, from 2017, while the yield on loans increased 24 basis points, reflecting the effect of rising interest rates on the floating rate loans in the portfolio. Average time and interest-bearing deposits at other banks increased $125.6 million while the yield on these deposits also increased 10 basis points.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 decreased $98.2 million, or 7.8%, from the prior year, due to the decline in deposits and securities under agreement to repurchase. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for 2018 was 0.55% compared to 0.37% for 2017, reflecting a higher average rate on interest-bearing deposits.\nThe following table shows the relative effect on net interest revenue resulting from changes in the average outstanding balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid by the Company on such assets and liabilities (in thousands).\n\nNOTE: Changes due to both volume and rate have generally been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts to the changes in each.\n- 36 -\nThe following table shows the return on assets and equity for our Company at December 31 for each of the years indicated.\n\nReturn on average assets and return on average common equity for 2018 were impacted by $19.7 million of regulatory remediation costs, $145,000 of one-time charges related to branch closure expense, a $987,000 in loan resolution expense, and a $7.7 million expense from establishment of a valuation allowance, offset by $726,000 in discount accretion acceleration. Excluding these non-operating items, negative return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 0.39% and negative return on average common equity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 3.47%. 2017 return on average assets and return on average common equity were impacted by $2.6 million in regulatory remediation costs, $6.0 million in loss on transfer of loans to held for sale, $1.5 million service and retention expenses, $1.4 million in branch closure expenses, and a $3.6 million write down of net deferred tax asset resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these non-operating items, negative return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.20% and negative return on average common equity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.59%.\n- 37 -\nResults of Operation\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income totaled $19.5 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $21.8 million at December 31, 2017. Our recurring non-interest income includes service charges and fees on deposit accounts, ATM and debit card income and credit card income.\nThe following table presents noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands).\n\nIncome from service charges and fees on deposit accounts, including insufficient funds fees ( NSF\u201d fees), decreased $1.1 million in 2018, as a result of a $785,000 decrease in retail NSF income. ATM and debit card income increased $413,000 in 2018. The increase in ATM and debit card income during 2018 was a result of a continued increase in electronic transactions processed. Credit card income remained stable at $1.5 million. Other noninterest income decreased $402,000 in 2018. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to a $669,000 decrease in mortgage lending income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our recurring non-interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, ATM and debit card expense and other operating expenses.\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands).\n\nAt December 31, 2018 noninterest expense totaled $92.3 million, an increase $11.8 million or 14.6% compared to the same period in 2017. Our largest noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits totaled $32.3 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 4.7% as of December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The number of employees on a full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") basis increased by 7 during 2018, from 467 at year end 2017 to 474 at year end 2018.\n- 38 -\nAt December 31, 2018, occupancy expense totaled $12.5 million, a decrease of $3.2 million or 20.2% compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the closure and sale of 9 branches in 2017 resulting in fewer branches in 2018 to service.\nAt December 31, 2018, legal and professional fees totaled $8.8 million, an increase of $5.5 million or 164.8% compared to the same period in 2017. The increase during the year is primarily a result of management's initiative to address and comply with the terms of the written regulatory order which includes the increased need for outside legal and professional assistance.\nAt December 31, 2018, regulatory remediation costs totaled $19.7 million, an increase of $17.1 million or 650.4% from the same period in 2017. The increase is related to consulting and outsourcing costs for assistance with addressing and complying with the terms of the written regulatory order.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $8.6 million in 2018. The increase is a result of the Company recording a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $11.1 million as of December 31, 2018. Our effective tax rate approximated (27.7%) and 18.1% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by the adjustment of our net deferred tax assets related to the temporary establishment of a valuations allowance to fully reserve against deferred tax assets. The impact of nontaxable municipal interest income and other tax considerations also contributed to lower effective tax rates for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n- 39 -\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nInvestment Securities\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company's debt securities for the years ended as of December 31 (in thousands).\n\nThe following table shows the debt securities maturities and the associated average taxable-equivalents yields at December 31, 2018 (in thousands).\n\n1 Tax exempt yields are expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis.\nThe composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue. The investment securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk in other categories of the balance sheet, while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowings, including repurchase agreements. Total investment securities at December 31, 2018 increased $87.3 million or 22.5% compared to the same period 2017.\n- 40 -\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had debt securities held-to-maturity with a carrying value of $37.8 million and $81.1 million, respectively, and debt securities available-for-sale totaling $437.8 million and $307.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the securities portfolio represented approximately 27.3% and 20.6%, respectively, of total assets. At December 31, 2018, the effective duration of the investment portfolio was 3.42 years, compared with 3.2 years at December 31, 2017.\nAdditional information on our investment securities portfolio is provided in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe following table shows the composition of the Company's loan portfolio for the last five years as of December 31 (in thousands).\n\nThe following table sets forth the maturity distribution, including the interest sensitivity for loans maturing after one year at December 31, 2018 (in thousands).\n\nThe loan portfolio decreased $283.6 million, or 23.97%, during 2018 when compared to the same period 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of our continued focus on reducing our nonperforming loans. One such effort is our intention to sell a portion of these nonperforming loans through a bulk loan sale which was the main source of our net charge-offs of $26.2 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $27.7 million the same period 2017.\nOur loan portfolio is diversified throughout our Louisiana and Texas markets, with a focus on Commercial & Industrial (\"C&I\") as well as Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") loans. The C&I portfolio consists primarily of term loans or revolving lines of credit. The term loans are generally fixed rates and have maturities of three to five years. The CRE portfolio consists primarily of three to five year fixed rate maturities with fifteen to twenty year amortization terms.\nThe Company strives to maintain a diversified loan portfolio across our footprint within various loan types. At December 31, 2018, our concentration within the oil and gas portfolio aggregated to more than 10% of our total loan portfolio. We define an energy loan as any loan where the borrower's ability to repay is disproportionately impacted by a prolonged downturn in energy prices. Under this definition, the Bank includes direct C&I loans to energy borrowers, as well as CRE loans, Residential Real Estate loans and loans to energy-related borrowers where the loan's primary collateral is cash and marketable securities. Although this definition has resulted in a lack of comparability with some other energy-related banks, management believes it to be the\n- 41 -\nprudent approach to monitoring and managing the Bank's energy exposure. Our exposure in the oil and gas industry, as defined above, totaled approximately $112.6 million, or 12.5% of total loans. The average loan size is approximately $377,000, and the average loan size per relationship is roughly $500,000. Of the $112.6 million loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry, $4.3 million or 3.8% were on nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018, with $2.1 million being included in nonperforming loans held for sale. We are closely monitoring the effects of the sustained decline in energy prices on our energy related loan portfolio. We continue to communicate with our customers who provide valuable insight on the present energy cycle. The energy reserve as a percentage of total energy loans was 3.2% at December 31, 2018.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table presents information on nonperforming assets, including loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\n(1)Does not include $8.6 million, $25.1 million, $20.9 million, and $234,000 of TDRs reported in nonaccrual loans at, December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were not any TDRs on nonaccrual staus at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, nonperforming assets totaled $30.5 million, a decrease of $26.8 million compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from a $40.4 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, which was partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in nonperforming loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2018. Troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") totaled $1.3 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in management's judgment, the collection of principal or interest income is doubtful. Past due loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. Our policy provides that unsecured retail (consumer) loans that become 90 days delinquent be routinely charged off. Loans classified for regulatory purposes but not included in the table above do not represent material amounts that we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with loan repayment terms. Further information regarding our loan policy is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 42 -\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly in accordance with GAAP and regulatory guidelines and includes a review of the loan portfolio, with particular emphasis on non-accruing, past due and other loans management believes may warrant additional attention. The loan portfolio is segregated based on loan type as a way to evaluate exposures to risks with the loan portfolio. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is a combination of specific allowances for identified problem loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. There are certain loans that are individually reviewed when it is determined by management that the general allocation is not sufficient to appropriately capture potential inherent weaknesses that may expose the Bank to loss. In these instances, we establish a specific allowance to those loans determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. We establish a general allowance for smaller balance, homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics of for which have not been specifically reviewed for probable incurred losses. We evaluate loss factors by taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative components impacting our probable incurred losses. These components include, but are not limited to historical charge-offs; known deterioration in concentrations of credit; trends in nonperforming assets; volume, maturity and composition of the loan portfolio; off-balance sheet credit risk; lending policies and control systems; national and local economic conditions; the experience, ability and depth of lending management; and the results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies and others.\nOur allowance for loan losses totaled $17.4 million and $26.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table presents activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nYear-to-date net charge-offs were 2.48% of average total loans as of December 31, 2018 compared to 2.21% as of December 31, 2017. The ALL/total loans ratio declined by 33 basis points to 1.94% at December 31, 2018 compared to 2.27% at December 31, 2017.\n- 43 -\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nFunding Sources\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2018, deposits totaled $1.5 billion, a decrease of $27.6 million or 1.87% compared to the same period in 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $33.4 million to $383.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and represented 26.4% of total deposits when compared to the same period in 2017. During 2018, money market and savings accounts increased $42.0 million and NOW accounts decreased $34.0 million, to $488.2 million and $400.6 million, respectively compared to the same period in 2017. Time deposits, which are comprised mostly of certificates of deposits ( CDs\u201d), decreased $2.2 million to $180.1 million in 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in total deposits during 2017 resulted primarily from decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW accounts of $67.4 million partially offset by an increase of $42.0 million in savings and money market accounts. Core deposits, defined as all deposits other than time deposits, remained strong at 87.6% of total deposits at year-end 2018 compared to 87.7% of total deposits at year-end 2017.\nThe following table presents the average amount of deposits classes and average rates paid on deposits for the years indicated (in thousands):\n\n- 44 -\nThe following table presents the maturity schedule for time deposits of $250,000 or more for the years indicated (in thousands):\n\nBorrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2018 securities sold under repurchase agreements totaled $11.2 million, a decrease of $55.9 million or 83.3% compared to the same period in 2017. Since the Bank's introduction of Promontory' s Insured Cash Sweep\u00ae (\"ICS\") product in 2018, we have migrated most of our commercial repurchase agreement relationships to this product. The ICS product is classified as \"deposits\" and does not require pledging of collateral,which management believes helps to improve our liquidity.\nFHLB advances totaled $27.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2017. The FHLB advances at December 31, 2018 consisted of two FHLB advances with maturities of 1 month at a fixed interest rate of 2.66%. The FHLB advances at December 31, 2017 consisted of two FHLB advances with maturities of 1 month at a fixed interest rate of 1.59% and one advance maturing January 2019 bearing a fixed interest rate of 1.985%. This advance was terminated in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe following table presents junior subordinated debentures outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands).\n\nOur outstanding debentures currently qualify as Tier 1 capital and are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as junior subordinated debentures. Additional information regarding long-term debt is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Regulations adopted as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in changes to the regulatory capital treatment of securities similar to our debentures. However, because of the issue date of our debentures and our asset size, we are allowed to continue to include the debentures in our Tier 1 capital.\nIn 2018 and 2017 we did not have an average balance in any category of short-term borrowings including retail repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, or FRB discount window that exceeded 30% of our stockholders' equity for such year.\nCapital\nWe are required to maintain certain minimum capital levels for the Company and the Bank. Risk-based capital requirements are intended to make regulatory capital more sensitive to the risk profile of an institution's assets. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implement the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital, increase risk-based capital requirements, and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. Details regarding the final rule and changes to capital requirements and prompt corrective action thresholds are included under Part I, Item 1 - Business, Supervision and Regulation. The final rules became effective as of January 1, 2015, for most banking organizations including the Company and the Bank, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the final rules, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, which became fully implemented as of January 1, 2019. Requirements to maintain higher levels\n- 45 -\nof capital could adversely impact our return on equity. We believe we will continue to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements under these new rules on a fully phased-in basis.\nThe payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is restricted by various regulatory and statutory limitations. As a result of the loss reported for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank does not have the ability to approve dividends to the Company without prior approval from the OCC. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $44.8 million of cash to fund general corporate obligations.\nIn connection with the SBLF transaction, the Company issued $32.0 million in Series B Preferred Stock to the Treasury. The dividend rate was set at 1.00% for the fourth quarter of 2013 due to attaining the target 10% growth rate in qualified small business loans during the second quarter of 2013. As a result of qualified small business loan growth as of September 30, 2013, the dividend rate was set at 1.00% for the period from January 1, 2014 through February 25, 2016. On February 25, 2016, the dividend rate increased to 9% per annum.\nOn June 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale of 4,583,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering, and on July 11, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an additional 516,700 shares of common stock, pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. After deducting the underwriting discount and costs associated with the capital raise, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $57.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with statutory minimum capital requirements. Minimum capital requirements include a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, with Tier 1 capital not less than 6.0%, common equity Tier 1 capital not less than 4.5% and a leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total average adjusted assets) of 4.0% based upon the regulators latest composite rating of the institution. In addition, the OCC has established higher individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank. Specifically, the Bank must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's leverage ratio was 11.45% compared to 12.53% at December 31, 2017. Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 17.79% and 16.51% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total capital to risk weighted assets was 19.04% and 17.77%, respectively, for the same periods. Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 12.20% and 12.10%, respectively, for the same periods. For regulatory purposes, Tier 1 Capital includes $21.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. For financial reporting purposes, these funds are included as a liability under GAAP. The Bank's leverage ratio was 9.11% and 9.86% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 established a capital-based supervisory system for all insured depository institutions that imposes increasing restrictions on the institution as its capital deteriorates. The Bank was classified as well capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2018.\nAsset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in market rates of interest. The primary objective of our asset and liability management process is to evaluate interest rate sensitivity inherent in our balance sheet components and establish guidelines to manage that risk within acceptable performance levels. Management and our Board of Directors are responsible for determining the appropriate level of acceptable risk based on our strategic focus, regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity, and the market environment. Our Board of Directors established an Asset/Liability management committee ( ALCO\u201d), comprised of certain executive and senior officers of the Bank, to measure and monitor interest rate risk within defined parameters. We utilize an external model for asset and liability management from our core processor. The model captures data directly from our operating system along with additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing, cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time periods.\nThis data, combined with additional assumptions including repricing rates and payment characteristics, were used to perform instantaneous parallel rate shift, gradual parallel rate shift, and alternate rate shift simulations. Instantaneous parallel rate shifts are known as rate shocks\u201d because all rates are modeled to change instantaneously by the indicated shock amount. Gradual parallel rate shifts are called \"Ramps\" and reflect incremental rate increases over a 12 month period. Alternate rate shifts include floor rates that generally provide more realistic projections of changes in net interest income and market risk, although given the current low rate environment deposits costs are overstated in a down 100 basis point scenario as the model does not currently allow for negative interest rates. Results of the simulations were compared to a base case scenario that provided projected net interest income over the next 12 months with no change in the balance sheet. The estimated percentage changes in projected net interest income due to changes in interest rates of alternate down 100 basis points, ramp up 100, parallel up 200, and up 300\n- 46 -\nbasis points as determined through the simulations are detailed below. At December 31, 2018, the interest rate risk model results were within policy guidelines and indicated that our balance sheet is slightly liability sensitive over a one year period. The results of the interest rate risk modeling are reviewed by ALCO and discussed quarterly at Funds Management committee meetings of our Board of Directors. The model captures data directly from our operating system along with additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing, cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time periods. As a result of an independent non-maturity deposit study commissioned in 2016, we updated our deposit beta assumptions, which are correlation assumptions between deposit rates and market rates, in rising rate scenarios on a consolidated basis from 40% to 60%. The actual deposit betas experienced in a rising rate scenario could be materially different from those assumed in the model, and therefore actual net income could be materially different from estimated net interest income indicated in the table below.\n\nLiquidity\nBank Liquidity\nLiquidity is the availability of funds to meet maturing contractual obligations and to fund operations. The Bank's primary liquidity needs involve its ability to accommodate customers' demands for deposit withdrawals as well as customers' requests for credit. Liquidity is deemed adequate when sufficient cash to meet these needs can be promptly raised at a reasonable cost to the Bank.\nLiquidity is provided primarily by three sources: a stable base of funding sources, an adequate level of assets that can be readily converted into cash, and borrowing lines with correspondent banks. Our core deposits are our most stable and important source of funding. Cash deposits at other banks, federal funds sold, and principal payments received on loans and mortgage-backed securities provide additional primary sources of liquidity. Approximately $66.2 million in projected cash flows from securities repayments during 2019 provides an additional source of liquidity.\nThe Bank also has significant borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank (\"FRB\") and with the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\"). As of December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings with the FRB. FHLB advances totaled $27.5 million at December 31, 2018 and consisted of a two fixed rate advances that matures in January 2019 and bears a fixed interest rate of 2.66%. The Bank has the ability to post additional collateral of approximately $210.6 million if necessary to meet liquidity needs. Additionally, $302.6 million in loan collateral is pledged under a Borrower-in-Custody line with the FRB. Under existing agreements with the FHLB, our borrowing capacity totaled $275.1 million at December 31, 2018. Additional unsecured borrowing lines totaling $30.0 million are available through correspondent banks. We utilize these contingency funding alternatives to meet deposit volatility, which is more likely in the current environment, given unusual competitive offerings within our markets.\nCompany Liquidity\nOn June 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale of 4,583,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to an underwritten public offering, and on July 11, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an additional 516,700 shares of common stock, pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. After deducting the underwriting discount and costs associated with the capital raise, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $57.2 million. The Company, subject to regulatory approval, intends to use $32.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a result of its participation in the SBLF. The Company intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds to enhance its capital structure, to fund future organic growth, for working capital, and other general corporate purposes.\n- 47 -\nAt the Company level, cash is needed primarily to meet interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures, dividend payments on the Series B and Series C Preferred Stock and dividends on the common stock. We issued $8,248,000 in unsecured junior subordinated debentures in September 2004 and $7,217,000 in February 2001. In August 2014, we paid off the $7.2 million junior subordinated debenture. In December 2012, we acquired $13.9 million in unsecured junior subordinated debentures from PSB Financial Corporation. The terms of the junior subordinated debentures are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Dividends from the Bank totaling $4,000,000 provided additional liquidity prior to the capital raise in 2017 for the Company to meet interest and dividend payments. Due to the loss reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, we currently do not have the ability to approve dividends from the Bank to the Company without prior approval from the OCC. At December 31, 2018, the parent company had approximately $44.1 million cash available for general corporate purposes, including injecting capital into the Bank.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments, which included commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, totaled $261.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nThose instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the Company's involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe Company's exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies, including considerations of collateral requirements, in making these commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, presented herein, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. For additional information, see Funding Sources - Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain financial information included in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. The table below presents a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net loss\u201d and adjusted diluted loss per share\u201d. Adjusted net loss\u201d is defined as net loss available to common shareholders less tax-effected nonoperating income and expense items, including securities gains/losses. Adjusted Diluted loss per share\u201d is defined as net loss available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by diluted weighted-average shares.\nWe use non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for evaluating our financial condition and performance over periods of time, as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our performance. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial condition as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that other companies may use.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP are included in the table below (in thousands except per share data).\n- 48 -\n\n- 49 -\n\n- 50 -", "item_7_tables": "Table 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
