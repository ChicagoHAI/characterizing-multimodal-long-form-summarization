Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 23 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals shop for, enroll in, manage, and exchange benefits. Our employer and insurance carrier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange data. Our web-based platform has a user-friendly interface designed to enable the insured consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support core benefits plans, including healthcare, dental, life, and disability insurance, and voluntary benefits plans, such as critical illness, supplemental income, and wellness programs. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform has grown.\nWe serve two separate but related market segments. Our fastest growing market segment, the employer market, consists of employers offering benefits to their employees. Within this segment, we mainly target large employers with more than 1,000 employees, of which we believe there are over 18,000 in the United States. In our other market segment, we sell our solutions to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. Our business model capitalizes on the close relationship between carriers and their members, and the carriers' ability to serve as lead generators for potential employer customers. Carriers pay for services at a rate reflective of the aggregated nature of their customer base on a per application basis. Carriers can then deploy their applications to employer groups and members. As employers become direct customers through our employer segment, we provide them our platform offering that bundles many software applications into a comprehensive benefits solution through Benefitfocus Marketplace. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier markets gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nWe sell the Benefitfocus Platform on a subscription basis, typically through annual contracts with employer customers and multi-year contracts with our insurance carrier customers, with subscription fees paid monthly. The multi-year contracts with our carrier customers are generally only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 87%, 91%, and 93% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. In general, it takes from four to five months to implement a new employer customer's benefits systems and eight to 10 months to implement a new carrier customer's benefits systems. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers' effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 13%, 9%, and 7% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncreasing our base of large employer customers is an important source of revenue growth for us. We actively pursue new employer customers in the U.S. market, and we have increased the number of large employer customers utilizing our solutions from 141 as of December 31, 2010 to 723 as of December 31, 2015, a 38.7% compound annual growth rate. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as online benefits marketplaces, also known as private exchanges, enhanced mobile offerings, and more robust data analytics capabilities will help us attract additional large employer customers and increase our revenue from existing customers.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past four years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. We have also substantially increased our marketing and sales efforts and expect those increased efforts to continue. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last five years, and expect our operating losses to continue for at least the next year. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been very stable with relatively few customer losses over the past years, and the subscription nature of our financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to substantially increased revenue, which will allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and segment gross profit, in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNumber of Large Employer and Carrier Customers\nWe believe the number of large employer and carrier customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our customer base. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active software services contract as of the measurement date. The following table sets forth the number of large employer and carrier customers for the periods indicated:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor 2015, 2014 and 2013 our software services revenue retention rate exceeded 95%.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Please refer to \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d in this report for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurement, respectively, for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and carrier customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue between software services and professional services for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our software has been granted to the customer and it is available for their use, the fee for the software services is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We defer recognition of our professional services fees paid by customers related to implementation services that are determined to not have stand-alone value and are sold with our software services, and recognize them, beginning once the software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which was 7 years in 2015 and 10 years in 2014 and 2013. We periodically evaluate the term over which revenue is recognized for professional services as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals.\nAs of July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for the implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without the Company's implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support our customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million in twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe generally invoice our employer and carrier customers for software services in advance, in monthly installments. We invoice our employer customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our carrier customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized to revenue as described above.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, IT costs, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing services to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services, performed before a customer is operating on our platform, that is determined to not have stand-alone value is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. For those implementation services that have standalone value, the related revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of service. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with implementation.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from large employers and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customer base.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new associates in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is One Place, which we have held annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the near term, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms as a result of operating as a public company, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, increased professional services expenses, and costs associated with an enhanced investor relations function.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense, accretion of contingent consideration, and gain (loss) on disposal of fixed assets. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, existing notes and credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $122.8 million at December 31, 2015. State net operating loss carryforwards were\napproximately $126.6 million at December 31, 2015. Federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. State net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe

the number of large employer and carrier customers increased to 777 as of December 31, 2015 from 596 as of December 31, 2014 and higher volumes from existing customers. The increase in professional services revenue of $11.3 million between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was in part attributable to the change in the customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years, resulting in an increase in revenue of $3.3 million from customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015. The remaining increase of $8.0 million was related to newly activated customers and products and other services provided to existing customers, including $2.4 million of revenue from services delivered that have standalone value.\nSegment Revenue\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Growth in our employer revenue was primarily attributable to a $28.7 million increase in our employer software services revenue driven primarily by an increase in the number of large employer customers using our platform as of December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 and increased volumes from existing customers. The increase in professional services included $2.4 million from services delivered that have standalone value. Additionally, employer professional services increased $0.6 million as a result of the change in the customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years for customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015. An additional increase of $1.1 million is attributable to employer professional services primarily related to newly completed implementations.\nGrowth in carrier revenue was attributable to an increase of $7.7 million in our carrier software services revenue and $7.2 million from our carrier professional services revenue. Increased carrier software services revenue was driven primarily by higher volumes and customer product implementations during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years for customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015 contributed a $0.9 million increase in carrier software services revenue. Increased carrier professional services revenue includes $4.5 million from customers and products that went live on the platform during 2015 and other services provided to existing customers as well as $2.7 million from the change in customer relationship.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in cost of revenue was in part attributable to an $13.3 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs and professional fees, including an increase of $0.9 million related to stock-based compensation.

This increase was partially offset by a $9.3 million, or 18.7%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $0.9 million and $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $7.7 million and $7.2 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional services gross loss was driven by an $11.3 million, or 91.8% increase in professional services revenue, partially offset by an increase in professional services cost of revenue of $6.1 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $1.0 million and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $1.4 million and $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and, with the exception of our Employer Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services which, since July 1, 2015, have been fully recognized as revenue at the time of completion, recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 7 years for 2015 and 10 years for 2014. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. For this reason, as well as due to the personnel-related costs associated with providing implementation services, our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of related revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services.\nSegment Gross Profit\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Employer gross profit increased by $17.5 million, or 107.9%, between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015. The $32.8 million, or 52.9%, increase in employer revenue was offset by a $15.4 million, or 33.5%, increase in employer cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of employer customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations. Our employer gross profit included $4.6 million and $3.5 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. In addition, our employer gross profit included $1.0 million and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCarrier gross profit increased by $14.9 million, or 44.0%, between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $14.9 million, or 19.8%, increase in carrier revenue and no change in carrier cost of revenue. Carrier cost of revenue was flat between year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015 as efforts shifted to the employer segment to support the growth in employer customers which resulted in fewer costs allocated to carrier cost of revenue. Our carrier gross profit included $4.5 million in depreciation and amortization in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

As discussed in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 10 years for the years presented. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the\nrecognition of the corresponding revenue. For this reason, as well as due to the personnel-related costs associated with providing implementation services, our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of related revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services.\nSegment Gross Profit\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Employer gross profit increased in absolute terms by $2.9 million, or 21.6%, between the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014. The $21.4 million, or 52.5%, increase in employer revenue was offset by an $18.5 million, or 67.6%, increase in employer cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of employer customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations. Our employer gross profit included $3.5 million and $2.5 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In addition, our employer gross profit included $0.5 million and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCarrier gross profit increased by $4.7 million, or 16.3%, between the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014. The $11.3 million, or 17.6%, increase in carrier revenue was offset by a $6.6 million, or 18.7%, increase in carrier cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of carrier customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations. Our carrier gross profit included $4.5 million and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In addition, our carrier gross profit included $0.4 million and $0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $7.7 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.2 million, due to sales and marketing associates hired to continue driving revenue growth and $1.8 million related to sales and marketing events, $1.9 million related to increases in facilities and overhead allocation, recruiting and other operating costs driven by an increase in the number of employees, and $0.8 million in travel-related costs.\nThe increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $10.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, due to additional research and development headcount. Additionally, we experienced a $5.5 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $1.8 million related to increases in facilities and overhead allocation, other operating costs, and travel-related costs driven by an increase in the number of employees.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in consulting and professional fees and insurance related to being a publicly traded company, including $0.7 million in costs related to our follow-on offering on July 17, 2014. We also experienced a $3.0 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to increased headcount. In addition, we experienced a $1.2 million increase related primarily to increases in facilities and overhead costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid by customers for access to and usage of our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services which primarily include fees related to the integration of customers' systems with our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration, deployment, testing, and training.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our cloud-based software services has commenced once it has granted the customer access to our platform.\nOur arrangements generally contain multiple elements comprised of software services and professional services. We evaluate each element in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy\nto use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement fee is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.\nEffective July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without our implementation services prior to July 1, 2015. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain of our other professional services, including implementation services related to the Carrier segment, are not sold separately from the software services and there is no alternative use for them. As such, we have determined that those professional services do not have standalone value. Accordingly, software services and professional services are combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting. We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, once the criteria for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. We recognize revenue on Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment that have standalone value at the time the services have been completed. We defer recognition of revenue for fees from professional services that do not have standalone value and begin recognizing such revenue once the services are delivered and the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. Costs incurred by us in connection with providing such professional services are charged to expense as incurred and are included in \u201cCost of revenue.\u201d\nIn January 2015, we adjusted the estimated expected life of the customer relationship period for both segments. This change in estimate was the result of analyzing recent quantitative and qualitative observations in the market and factors impacting our business. This change in estimate shortened the term over which deferred revenue is recognized from 10 to 7 years and was applied prospectively to unamortized professional services fees over the longer of the contract term or the adjusted estimated expected life of the customer relationship.\nThe change in the customer relationship period increased the amount of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, which decreased both loss from continuing operations and net loss by $6,207 and decreased loss per share by $0.22 for the year. As a result of the change in the customer relationship period, Employer and Carrier revenue increased by $1,137 and $5,070, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns\nWe state accounts receivable at realizable value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts that we maintain for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due. We base our estimated allowance on our analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations. Historically, our actual collection experience has not varied significantly from our estimates, due primarily to our credit and collection policies and the financial strength of our customers.\nThe allowances for returns are accounted for as reductions of revenue and are estimated based on the Company's periodic assessment of historical experience and trends. The Company considers factors such as the time lag since the initiation of revenue recognition, historical reasons for adjustments, new customer volume, complexity of billing arrangements, timing of software availability, and past due customer billings.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform an assessment of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company-specific events, changes in strategy and circumstances, revenue, and operating margins. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the relevant reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. In step one, we determine if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the unit's carrying value. If step one indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform step two, determining the fair value of goodwill and, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, recording an impairment charge.\nWe have determined that we have two operating segments, employer and carrier. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of an appropriate discount rate, estimated terminal value and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued two types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based awards granted to associates, directors, and non-associate third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period of the option award. Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting over the following 36 months. We previously granted options that vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant date over 4 years.\nIn 2015, we granted performance restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets. Compensation expense for performance restricted stock units, which\nare accounted for as equity awards, is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the award will vest. Significant judgment is involved in assessing the probability of achieving performance measures.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-Based Compensation Grants\nPrior to our IPO, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. We have periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, \u201cValuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,\u201d or the Practice Aid. When determining the fair market value of our common stock, we considered what we believe to be comparable publicly traded companies, discounted free cash flows, and an analysis of our enterprise value.\nSince our IPO, we determined fair value for restricted stock unit awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant or, if not a trading day, the trading day preceding the grant date.\nThe determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation arrangements is affected by a number of variables, including estimates of the fair value of our common stock, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the expected life of the award. We value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions. Black-Scholes and other option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the period indicated (we did not grant any stock options in 2015 or 2014):\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% - 1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average grant date fair value per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We have assumed no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, which is consistent with our past practice. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected life of our associate stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We used the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The list of comparable companies we used to determine expected volatility was consistent with those used to determine the corresponding fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\nWe based our estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures, or forfeiture rate, on our analysis of historical behavior by stock award holders. We apply the estimated forfeiture rate to the total estimated fair value\nof the awards, as derived from the Black-Scholes model, to compute the stock-based compensation expense, net of pre-vesting forfeitures, to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBased upon our closing stock price on December 31, 2015 of $36.39, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015 was $48.4 million, of which $45.8 million related to vested options and $2.6 million to unvested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2015 was $37.0 million, of which all were unvested.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling $48.1 million and $40.4 million in marketable securities, $29.7 million in accounts receivables, net of allowance, and unused revolving line of credit of $29.8 million. The terms of our revolving line of credit are described in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn September 23, 2013, we closed our IPO in which we sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $26.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $70.1 million. See Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding our IPO.\nIn February 2015, the Company replaced its existing revolving line of credit (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) with a senior revolving line of credit (the \u201cSenior Revolver\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders led by the existing lender. The three-year Senior Revolver has a borrowing limit of $60.0 million. Borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolver is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under the Senior Revolver may be less than the $60.0 million borrowing limit. The outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver was repaid with proceeds from the Senior Revolver and the Revolver was terminated. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the Senior Revolver bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on our liquidity that ranges between 1.0% and 1.5%. We are charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate based on our liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nWe are bound by customary affirmative and negative covenants in connection with the Senior Revolver, including financial covenants related to liquidity and EBITDA. In the event of a default, the lenders may declare all obligations immediately due and stop advancing money or extending credit under the line of credit. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and the equity of our subsidiaries.\nOn February 24, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell shares of our common stock to Mercer, one of our customers. Pursuant to the agreement, on the same date, we sold 2,817,526 shares of our common stock to Mercer for $26.50 per share or an aggregate of approximately $74.7 million. At the same time, we also issued Mercer a warrant to purchase up to an additional 580,813 shares of our common stock for $26.50 per share at any time during the 30-month term of the warrant. The agreement, among other things, includes certain standstill provisions and prevents Mercer from disposing of its shares of our common stock until the earlier of December 31, 2017, the expiration or termination of the Mercer Exchange Software as a Service Agreement, as amended between us and Mercer Health & Benefits, LLC, the date on which Mercer and its affiliates own less than 75% of the shares it purchased pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the date on which Mercer and its affiliates own less than 5% of our outstanding common stock. We received all of the proceeds from this sale of shares and will use the proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nBased on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nGoing forward, we may access capital markets to raise additional equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,878 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,245 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,953 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,077 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,571 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,942 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations decreased $12.7 million during 2015 to $(31.5) million, as changes in working capital provided $1.3 million cash and adjustments for non-cash items of $29.3 million partially offset a net loss of $(62.1) million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $3.0 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $3.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $7.8 million. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable are\nthe result of timing of the receipt of invoices and the timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivable resulted from a few significant invoices related to new contracts and the normal timing of customer payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our operating activities used $18.9 million of cash, as $24.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $19.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items, were more than offset by a net loss of $63.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $9.5 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $5.6 million, change in fair value and accretion of warrant of $0.7 million, and accrual of interest on financing obligations of $3.6 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $14.3 million, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.2 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $2.5 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.4 million. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue, ratably over the customer relationship period, beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted from normal timing of customer payments. The increase in accrued expenses resulted from an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities of $1.1 million consisted of a net loss of $30.4 million more than offset by $19.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $12.1 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $8.2 million, accrued interest on financing obligation of $1.8 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.2 million, and a change in fair value and accretion of warrant of $0.9 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $22.7 million, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $4.5 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the customer relationship period beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from normal fluctuation in payroll dates and an increase in the number of associates. The increase in accounts payable resulted from an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to a $10.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our revenue and fees.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $50.2 million for 2015 as net purchases of marketable securities were $35.5 million and cash purchases of property and equipment were $14.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $2.0 million for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was $9.8 million partially offset by the cash provided by net maturity of short-term investments held to maturity of $7.9 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $22.1 million for 2013. We purchased corporate bonds in the amount of $13.2 million. In addition, we spent $8.9 million to purchase property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $78.8 million, primarily as a result of $74.5 million from the issuance of common stock and a warrant in a private placement to Mercer, and net draws on the revolving line of credit of $12.6 million offset by payments on financing and capital lease obligations of $9.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million, consisting of a $14.0 million draw on revolving line of credit and $2.8 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options, offset by $8.2 million in payments on financing and capital lease obligations and payments on revolving line of credit of $2.1 million.\nOn March 28, 2014, a major customer exercised its warrant through a cashless exercise in accordance with the warrant's terms, resulting in the issuance of 455,521 shares of common stock. The measured value of the warrant became fully recognized against revenue in October 2014.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $67.0 million for 2013, which resulted primarily from $70.1 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of issuance costs, $12.2 million in proceeds from line of credit and notes payable borrowings and $0.7 million from exercises of stock options, partially offset by $15.8 million in repayments of notes payable, line of credit, and financing and capital lease obligations and $0.3 million in payments of contingent consideration.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We might require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional capital might not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding credit facilities, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment and purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1\nyear </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5\nyears </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt-Revolving line of credit (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations, build-to-suit leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations, other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in 2018.

The three-year Senior Revolver has a borrowing limit of $60.0 million. Borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolver is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under the Senior Revolver may be less than the $60.0 million borrowing limit. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the Senior Revolver bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on our liquidity that ranges between 1.0% and 1.5%. We are charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate based on our liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nOn December 13, 2013, we entered into a 15-year build-to-suit lease for additional office space at our Charleston, South Carolina campus. The rentable area of the constructed building is approximately 145,000 square feet and the lease commenced on January 1, 2015. Aggregate minimum payments under the arrangement total $77.1 million are included in the contractual obligations table above. Under this lease agreement we executed an option to lease two additional adjacent buildings. The annual cost of the option is $466,000 per year for term of the option, which is three years. Additionally, we may incur a termination fee if we terminate the option or let the option expire. The termination fee of $757,000 will be prorated through the date of termination or expiration. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized a liability related to the option in the amount of $488,000. No amounts have been recognized related the to the termination fee. However, if we had terminated the option effective December 31, 2015, we would have incurred expense in the amount of $517,000.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, other than as disclosed in Note 15, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance or special purpose entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which amends the revenue recognition requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This statement requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The statement shall be applied using one of two methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet determined which method we will apply. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with an option to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \u201cInterest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\u201d The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance\nis effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2015, with an option to early adopt. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16 \u201cBusiness Combinations-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d, which updated guidance regarding business combinations that requires an acquirer to recognize post-close measurement adjustments for provisional amounts in the period the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. The acquirer is also required to recognize, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the provisional amount, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The updated guidance is to be applied prospectively effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In connection with business combinations which have already been completed, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position.\nWe are evaluating other accounting standards and exposure drafts that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 23 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals shop for, enroll in, manage, and exchange benefits. Our employer and insurance carrier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange data. Our web-based platform has a user-friendly interface designed to enable the insured consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support core benefits plans, including healthcare, dental, life, and disability insurance, and voluntary benefits plans, such as critical illness, supplemental income, and wellness programs. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform has grown.\nWe serve two separate but related market segments. Our fastest growing market segment, the employer market, consists of employers offering benefits to their employees. Within this segment, we mainly target large employers with more than 1,000 employees, of which we believe there are over 18,000 in the United States. In our other market segment, we sell our solutions to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. Our business model capitalizes on the close relationship between carriers and their members, and the carriers' ability to serve as lead generators for potential employer customers. Carriers pay for services at a rate reflective of the aggregated nature of their customer base on a per application basis. Carriers can then deploy their applications to employer groups and members. As employers become direct customers through our employer segment, we provide them our platform offering that bundles many software applications into a comprehensive benefits solution through Benefitfocus Marketplace. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier markets gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nWe sell the Benefitfocus Platform on a subscription basis, typically through annual contracts with employer customers and multi-year contracts with our insurance carrier customers, with subscription fees paid monthly. The multi-year contracts with our carrier customers are generally only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 87%, 91%, and 93% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. In general, it takes from four to five months to implement a new employer customer's benefits systems and eight to 10 months to implement a new carrier customer's benefits systems. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers' effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 13%, 9%, and 7% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncreasing our base of large employer customers is an important source of revenue growth for us. We actively pursue new employer customers in the U.S. market, and we have increased the number of large employer customers utilizing our solutions from 141 as of December 31, 2010 to 723 as of December 31, 2015, a 38.7% compound annual growth rate. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as online benefits marketplaces, also known as private exchanges, enhanced mobile offerings, and more robust data analytics capabilities will help us attract additional large employer customers and increase our revenue from existing customers.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past four years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. We have also substantially increased our marketing and sales efforts and expect those increased efforts to continue. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last five years, and expect our operating losses to continue for at least the next year. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been very stable with relatively few customer losses over the past years, and the subscription nature of our financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to substantially increased revenue, which will allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and segment gross profit, in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNumber of Large Employer and Carrier Customers\nWe believe the number of large employer and carrier customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our customer base. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active software services contract as of the measurement date. The following table sets forth the number of large employer and carrier customers for the periods indicated:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor 2015, 2014 and 2013 our software services revenue retention rate exceeded 95%.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Please refer to \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d in this report for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurement, respectively, for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and carrier customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue between software services and professional services for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our software has been granted to the customer and it is available for their use, the fee for the software services is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We defer recognition of our professional services fees paid by customers related to implementation services that are determined to not have stand-alone value and are sold with our software services, and recognize them, beginning once the software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which was 7 years in 2015 and 10 years in 2014 and 2013. We periodically evaluate the term over which revenue is recognized for professional services as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals.\nAs of July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for the implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without the Company's implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support our customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million in twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe generally invoice our employer and carrier customers for software services in advance, in monthly installments. We invoice our employer customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our carrier customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized to revenue as described above.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, IT costs, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing services to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services, performed before a customer is operating on our platform, that is determined to not have stand-alone value is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. For those implementation services that have standalone value, the related revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of service. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with implementation.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from large employers and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customer base.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new associates in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is One Place, which we have held annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the near term, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms as a result of operating as a public company, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, increased professional services expenses, and costs associated with an enhanced investor relations function.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense, accretion of contingent consideration, and gain (loss) on disposal of fixed assets. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, existing notes and credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $122.8 million at December 31, 2015. State net operating loss carryforwards were\napproximately $126.6 million at December 31, 2015. Federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. State net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe

Growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, as the number of large employer and carrier customers increased to 777 as of December 31, 2015 from 596 as of December 31, 2014 and higher volumes from existing customers. The increase in professional services revenue of $11.3 million between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was in part attributable to the change in the customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years, resulting in an increase in revenue of $3.3 million from customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015. The remaining increase of $8.0 million was related to newly activated customers and products and other services provided to existing customers, including $2.4 million of revenue from services delivered that have standalone value.\nSegment Revenue\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Growth in our employer revenue was primarily attributable to a $28.7 million increase in our employer software services revenue driven primarily by an increase in the number of large employer customers using our platform as of December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 and increased volumes from existing customers. The increase in professional services included $2.4 million from services delivered that have standalone value. Additionally, employer professional services increased $0.6 million as a result of the change in the customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years for customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015. An additional increase of $1.1 million is attributable to employer professional services primarily related to newly completed implementations.\nGrowth in carrier revenue was attributable to an increase of $7.7 million in our carrier software services revenue and $7.2 million from our carrier professional services revenue. Increased carrier software services revenue was driven primarily by higher volumes and customer product implementations during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years for customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015 contributed a $0.9 million increase in carrier software services revenue. Increased carrier professional services revenue includes $4.5 million from customers and products that went live on the platform during 2015 and other services provided to existing customers as well as $2.7 million from the change in customer relationship.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in cost of revenue was in part attributable to an $13.3 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs and professional fees, including an increase of $0.9 million related to stock-based compensation. Approximately $5.8 million of the increase in salaries and personnel-related costs was associated with increased client service capacity to support our growing number of customers and an increase in engineering costs of $6.7 million.

This increase was partially offset by a $9.3 million, or 18.7%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $0.9 million and $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $7.7 million and $7.2 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional services gross loss was driven by an $11.3 million, or 91.8% increase in professional services revenue, partially offset by an increase in professional services cost of revenue of $6.1 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $1.0 million and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $1.4 million and $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and, with the exception of our Employer Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services which, since July 1, 2015, have been fully recognized as revenue at the time of completion, recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 7 years for 2015 and 10 years for 2014. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. For this reason, as well as due to the personnel-related costs associated with providing implementation services, our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of related revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services.\nSegment Gross Profit\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Employer gross profit increased by $17.5 million, or 107.9%, between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015. The $32.8 million, or 52.9%, increase in employer revenue was offset by a $15.4 million, or 33.5%, increase in employer cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of employer customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations.

The increase is primarily attributable to a $14.9 million, or 19.8%, increase in carrier revenue and no change in carrier cost of revenue. Carrier cost of revenue was flat between year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015 as efforts shifted to the employer segment to support the growth in employer customers which resulted in fewer costs allocated to carrier cost of revenue.

This increase was partially offset by a $13.7 million, or 37.9%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $0.4 million and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $7.2 million and $6.7 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe increase in professional services gross loss was driven by an $11.4 million, or 43.3%, increase in professional services cost of revenue, partially offset by an increase in professional services revenue of $5.3 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $0.5 million and $0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $0.8 million and $0.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As discussed in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 10 years for the years presented. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the\nrecognition of the corresponding revenue. For this reason, as well as due to the personnel-related costs associated with providing implementation services, our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of related revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services.\nSegment Gross Profit\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employer\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrier\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Employer gross profit increased in absolute terms by $2.9 million, or 21.6%, between the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014.

Additionally, we experienced a $5.5 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $1.8 million related to increases in facilities and overhead allocation, other operating costs, and travel-related costs driven by an increase in the number of employees.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in consulting and professional fees and insurance related to being a publicly traded company, including $0.7 million in costs related to our follow-on offering on July 17, 2014. We also experienced a $3.0 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to increased headcount. In addition, we experienced a $1.2 million increase related primarily to increases in facilities and overhead costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid by customers for access to and usage of our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services which primarily include fees related to the integration of customers' systems with our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration, deployment, testing, and training.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our cloud-based software services has commenced once it has granted the customer access to our platform.\nOur arrangements generally contain multiple elements comprised of software services and professional services. We evaluate each element in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy\nto use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement fee is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.\nEffective July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without our implementation services prior to July 1, 2015. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain of our other professional services, including implementation services related to the Carrier segment, are not sold separately from the software services and there is no alternative use for them. As such, we have determined that those professional services do not have standalone value. Accordingly, software services and professional services are combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting. We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, once the criteria for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. We recognize revenue on Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment that have standalone value at the time the services have been completed. We defer recognition of revenue for fees from professional services that do not have standalone value and begin recognizing such revenue once the services are delivered and the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. Costs incurred by us in connection with providing such professional services are charged to expense as incurred and are included in \u201cCost of revenue.\u201d\nIn January 2015, we adjusted the estimated expected life of the customer relationship period for both segments. This change in estimate was the result of analyzing recent quantitative and qualitative observations in the market and factors impacting our business. This change in estimate shortened the term over which deferred revenue is recognized from 10 to 7 years and was applied prospectively to unamortized professional services fees over the longer of the contract term or the adjusted estimated expected life of the customer relationship.\nThe change in the customer relationship period increased the amount of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, which decreased both loss from continuing operations and net loss by $6,207 and decreased loss per share by $0.22 for the year. As a result of the change in the customer relationship period, Employer and Carrier revenue increased by $1,137 and $5,070, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns\nWe state accounts receivable at realizable value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts that we maintain for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due. We base our estimated allowance on our analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations. Historically, our actual collection experience has not varied significantly from our estimates, due primarily to our credit and collection policies and the financial strength of our customers.\nThe allowances for returns are accounted for as reductions of revenue and are estimated based on the Company's periodic assessment of historical experience and trends. The Company considers factors such as the time lag since the initiation of revenue recognition, historical reasons for adjustments, new customer volume, complexity of billing arrangements, timing of software availability, and past due customer billings.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform an assessment of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company-specific events, changes in strategy and circumstances, revenue, and operating margins. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the relevant reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. In step one, we determine if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the unit's carrying value. If step one indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform step two, determining the fair value of goodwill and, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, recording an impairment charge.\nWe have determined that we have two operating segments, employer and carrier. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of an appropriate discount rate, estimated terminal value and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued two types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based awards granted to associates, directors, and non-associate third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period of the option award. Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting over the following 36 months. We previously granted options that vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant date over 4 years.\nIn 2015, we granted performance restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets. Compensation expense for performance restricted stock units, which\nare accounted for as equity awards, is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the award will vest. Significant judgment is involved in assessing the probability of achieving performance measures.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-Based Compensation Grants\nPrior to our IPO, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. We have periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, \u201cValuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,\u201d or the Practice Aid. When determining the fair market value of our common stock, we considered what we believe to be comparable publicly traded companies, discounted free cash flows, and an analysis of our enterprise value.\nSince our IPO, we determined fair value for restricted stock unit awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant or, if not a trading day, the trading day preceding the grant date.\nThe determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation arrangements is affected by a number of variables, including estimates of the fair value of our common stock, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the expected life of the award. We value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions. Black-Scholes and other option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the period indicated (we did not grant any stock options in 2015 or 2014):\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% - 1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average grant date fair value per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We have assumed no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, which is consistent with our past practice. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected life of our associate stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We used the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The list of comparable companies we used to determine expected volatility was consistent with those used to determine the corresponding fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\nWe based our estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures, or forfeiture rate, on our analysis of historical behavior by stock award holders. We apply the estimated forfeiture rate to the total estimated fair value\nof the awards, as derived from the Black-Scholes model, to compute the stock-based compensation expense, net of pre-vesting forfeitures, to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBased upon our closing stock price on December 31, 2015 of $36.39, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015 was $48.4 million, of which $45.8 million related to vested options and $2.6 million to unvested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2015 was $37.0 million, of which all were unvested.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling $48.1 million and $40.4 million in marketable securities, $29.7 million in accounts receivables, net of allowance, and unused revolving line of credit of $29.8 million. The terms of our revolving line of credit are described in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn September 23, 2013, we closed our IPO in which we sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $26.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $70.1 million. See Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding our IPO.\nIn February 2015, the Company replaced its existing revolving line of credit (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) with a senior revolving line of credit (the \u201cSenior Revolver\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders led by the existing lender. The three-year Senior Revolver has a borrowing limit of $60.0 million. Borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolver is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under the Senior Revolver may be less than the $60.0 million borrowing limit. The outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver was repaid with proceeds from the Senior Revolver and the Revolver was terminated. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the Senior Revolver bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on our liquidity that ranges between 1.0% and 1.5%. We are charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate based on our liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nWe are bound by customary affirmative and negative covenants in connection with the Senior Revolver, including financial covenants related to liquidity and EBITDA. In the event of a default, the lenders may declare all obligations immediately due and stop advancing money or extending credit under the line of credit. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and the equity of our subsidiaries.\nOn February 24, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell shares of our common stock to Mercer, one of our customers. Pursuant to the agreement, on the same date, we sold 2,817,526 shares of our common stock to Mercer for $26.50 per share or an aggregate of approximately $74.7 million. At the same time, we also issued Mercer a warrant to purchase up to an additional 580,813 shares of our common stock for $26.50 per share at any time during the 30-month term of the warrant. The agreement, among other things, includes certain standstill provisions and prevents Mercer from disposing of its shares of our common stock until the earlier of December 31, 2017, the expiration or termination of the Mercer Exchange Software as a Service Agreement, as amended between us and Mercer Health & Benefits, LLC, the date on which Mercer and its affiliates own less than 75% of the shares it purchased pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the date on which Mercer and its affiliates own less than 5% of our outstanding common stock. We received all of the proceeds from this sale of shares and will use the proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nBased on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nGoing forward, we may access capital markets to raise additional equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,878 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,245 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,953 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,077 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,571 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,942 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations decreased $12.7 million during 2015 to $(31.5) million, as changes in working capital provided $1.3 million cash and adjustments for non-cash items of $29.3 million partially offset a net loss of $(62.1) million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $3.0 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $3.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $7.8 million. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable are\nthe result of timing of the receipt of invoices and the timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivable resulted from a few significant invoices related to new contracts and the normal timing of customer payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our operating activities used $18.9 million of cash, as $24.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $19.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items, were more than offset by a net loss of $63.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $9.5 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $5.6 million, change in fair value and accretion of warrant of $0.7 million, and accrual of interest on financing obligations of $3.6 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $14.3 million, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.2 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $2.5 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.4 million. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue, ratably over the customer relationship period, beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted from normal timing of customer payments. The increase in accrued expenses resulted from an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities of $1.1 million consisted of a net loss of $30.4 million more than offset by $19.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $12.1 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $8.2 million, accrued interest on financing obligation of $1.8 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.2 million, and a change in fair value and accretion of warrant of $0.9 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $22.7 million, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $4.5 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the customer relationship period beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from normal fluctuation in payroll dates and an increase in the number of associates. The increase in accounts payable resulted from an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to a $10.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our revenue and fees.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $50.2 million for 2015 as net purchases of marketable securities were $35.5 million and cash purchases of property and equipment were $14.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $2.0 million for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was $9.8 million partially offset by the cash provided by net maturity of short-term investments held to maturity of $7.9 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $22.1 million for 2013. We purchased corporate bonds in the amount of $13.2 million. In addition, we spent $8.9 million to purchase property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $78.8 million, primarily as a result of $74.5 million from the issuance of common stock and a warrant in a private placement to Mercer, and net draws on the revolving line of credit of $12.6 million offset by payments on financing and capital lease obligations of $9.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million, consisting of a $14.0 million draw on revolving line of credit and $2.8 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options, offset by $8.2 million in payments on financing and capital lease obligations and payments on revolving line of credit of $2.1 million.\nOn March 28, 2014, a major customer exercised its warrant through a cashless exercise in accordance with the warrant's terms, resulting in the issuance of 455,521 shares of common stock. The measured value of the warrant became fully recognized against revenue in October 2014.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $67.0 million for 2013, which resulted primarily from $70.1 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of issuance costs, $12.2 million in proceeds from line of credit and notes payable borrowings and $0.7 million from exercises of stock options, partially offset by $15.8 million in repayments of notes payable, line of credit, and financing and capital lease obligations and $0.3 million in payments of contingent consideration.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We might require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional capital might not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding credit facilities, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment and purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1\nyear </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5\nyears </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt-Revolving line of credit (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations, build-to-suit leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations, other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in 2018. Early repayment is allowed. Interest is paid monthly. \nIn February 2015, the Company replaced the Revolver with the Senior Revolver involving a syndicate of lenders led by the existing lender. The three-year Senior Revolver has a borrowing limit of $60.0 million. Borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolver is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under the Senior Revolver may be less than the $60.0 million borrowing limit. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the Senior Revolver bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on our liquidity that ranges between 1.0% and 1.5%. We are charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate based on our liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nOn December 13, 2013, we entered into a 15-year build-to-suit lease for additional office space at our Charleston, South Carolina campus. The rentable area of the constructed building is approximately 145,000 square feet and the lease commenced on January 1, 2015. Aggregate minimum payments under the arrangement total $77.1 million are included in the contractual obligations table above. Under this lease agreement we executed an option to lease two additional adjacent buildings. The annual cost of the option is $466,000 per year for term of the option, which is three years. Additionally, we may incur a termination fee if we terminate the option or let the option expire. The termination fee of $757,000 will be prorated through the date of termination or expiration. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized a liability related to the option in the amount of $488,000. No amounts have been recognized related the to the termination fee. However, if we had terminated the option effective December 31, 2015, we would have incurred expense in the amount of $517,000.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, other than as disclosed in Note 15, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance or special purpose entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which amends the revenue recognition requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This statement requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The statement shall be applied using one of two methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet determined which method we will apply. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with an option to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \u201cInterest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\u201d The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance\nis effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2015, with an option to early adopt. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16 \u201cBusiness Combinations-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d, which updated guidance regarding business combinations that requires an acquirer to recognize post-close measurement adjustments for provisional amounts in the period the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. The acquirer is also required to recognize, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the provisional amount, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The updated guidance is to be applied prospectively effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In connection with business combinations which have already been completed, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position.\nWe are evaluating other accounting standards and exposure drafts that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 23 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals shop for, enroll in, manage, and exchange benefits. Our employer and insurance carrier customers rely on our platform to manage, scale and exchange data. Our web-based platform has a user-friendly interface designed to enable the insured consumers to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support core benefits plans, including healthcare, dental, life, and disability insurance, and voluntary benefits plans, such as critical illness, supplemental income, and wellness programs. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform has grown.\nWe serve two separate but related market segments. Our fastest growing market segment, the employer market, consists of employers offering benefits to their employees. Within this segment, we mainly target large employers with more than 1,000 employees, of which we believe there are over 18,000 in the United States. In our other market segment, we sell our solutions to insurance carriers, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. Our business model capitalizes on the close relationship between carriers and their members, and the carriers' ability to serve as lead generators for potential employer customers. Carriers pay for services at a rate reflective of the aggregated nature of their customer base on a per application basis. Carriers can then deploy their applications to employer groups and members. As employers become direct customers through our employer segment, we provide them our platform offering that bundles many software applications into a comprehensive benefits solution through Benefitfocus Marketplace. We believe our presence in both the employer and insurance carrier markets gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nWe sell the Benefitfocus Platform on a subscription basis, typically through annual contracts with employer customers and multi-year contracts with our insurance carrier customers, with subscription fees paid monthly. The multi-year contracts with our carrier customers are generally only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 87%, 91%, and 93% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. In general, it takes from four to five months to implement a new employer customer's benefits systems and eight to 10 months to implement a new carrier customer's benefits systems. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers' effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 13%, 9%, and 7% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncreasing our base of large employer customers is an important source of revenue growth for us. We actively pursue new employer customers in the U.S. market, and we have increased the number of large employer customers utilizing our solutions from 141 as of December 31, 2010 to 723 as of December 31, 2015, a 38.7% compound annual growth rate. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as online benefits marketplaces, also known as private exchanges, enhanced mobile offerings, and more robust data analytics capabilities will help us attract additional large employer customers and increase our revenue from existing customers.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past four years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. We have also substantially increased our marketing and sales efforts and expect those increased efforts to continue. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last five years, and expect our operating losses to continue for at least the next year. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been very stable with relatively few customer losses over the past years, and the subscription nature of our financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to substantially increased revenue, which will allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and segment gross profit, in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNumber of Large Employer and Carrier Customers\nWe believe the number of large employer and carrier customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our customer base. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active software services contract as of the measurement date. The following table sets forth the number of large employer and carrier customers for the periods indicated:\n\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor 2015, 2014 and 2013 our software services revenue retention rate exceeded 95%.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Please refer to \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d in this report for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurement, respectively, for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and carrier customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue between software services and professional services for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our software has been granted to the customer and it is available for their use, the fee for the software services is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We defer recognition of our professional services fees paid by customers related to implementation services that are determined to not have stand-alone value and are sold with our software services, and recognize them, beginning once the software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which was 7 years in 2015 and 10 years in 2014 and 2013. We periodically evaluate the term over which revenue is recognized for professional services as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals.\nAs of July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for the implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without the Company's implementation services. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support our customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million in twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe generally invoice our employer and carrier customers for software services in advance, in monthly installments. We invoice our employer customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our carrier customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized to revenue as described above.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, IT costs, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing services to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense our cost of revenue as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services, performed before a customer is operating on our platform, that is determined to not have stand-alone value is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. For those implementation services that have standalone value, the related revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of service. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with implementation.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in absolute dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from large employers and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customer base.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new associates in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is One Place, which we have held annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the near term, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms as a result of operating as a public company, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, increased professional services expenses, and costs associated with an enhanced investor relations function.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense, accretion of contingent consideration, and gain (loss) on disposal of fixed assets. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, existing notes and credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $122.8 million at December 31, 2015. State net operating loss carryforwards were\napproximately $126.6 million at December 31, 2015. Federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. State net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).\n\n (1) Cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands): \n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated (as a percentage of revenue).\n Our Segments\nThe following table sets forth segment results for revenue and gross profit for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n Growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, as the number of large employer and carrier customers increased to 777 as of December 31, 2015 from 596 as of December 31, 2014 and higher volumes from existing customers. The increase in professional services revenue of $11.3 million between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was in part attributable to the change in the customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years, resulting in an increase in revenue of $3.3 million from customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015. The remaining increase of $8.0 million was related to newly activated customers and products and other services provided to existing customers, including $2.4 million of revenue from services delivered that have standalone value.\nSegment Revenue\n Growth in our employer revenue was primarily attributable to a $28.7 million increase in our employer software services revenue driven primarily by an increase in the number of large employer customers using our platform as of December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 and increased volumes from existing customers. The increase in professional services included $2.4 million from services delivered that have standalone value. Additionally, employer professional services increased $0.6 million as a result of the change in the customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years for customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015. An additional increase of $1.1 million is attributable to employer professional services primarily related to newly completed implementations.\nGrowth in carrier revenue was attributable to an increase of $7.7 million in our carrier software services revenue and $7.2 million from our carrier professional services revenue. Increased carrier software services revenue was driven primarily by higher volumes and customer product implementations during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in customer relationship period from 10 to 7 years for customers that were using our platform prior to the beginning of 2015 contributed a $0.9 million increase in carrier software services revenue. Increased carrier professional services revenue includes $4.5 million from customers and products that went live on the platform during 2015 and other services provided to existing customers as well as $2.7 million from the change in customer relationship.\nCost of Revenue\n The increase in cost of revenue was in part attributable to an $13.3 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs and professional fees, including an increase of $0.9 million related to stock-based compensation. Approximately $5.8 million of the increase in salaries and personnel-related costs was associated with increased client service capacity to support our growing number of customers and an increase in engineering costs of $6.7 million. Also, we experienced a $2.3 million increase in infrastructure maintenance costs to support our platform and additional depreciation and amortization and facilities costs related to the increase in the number of employees.\nGross Profit\n The increase in software services gross profit in absolute terms was driven by a $36.4 million, or 29.1%, increase in software services revenue. This increase was partially offset by a $9.3 million, or 18.7%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $0.9 million and $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $7.7 million and $7.2 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional services gross loss was driven by an $11.3 million, or 91.8% increase in professional services revenue, partially offset by an increase in professional services cost of revenue of $6.1 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $1.0 million and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $1.4 million and $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and, with the exception of our Employer Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services which, since July 1, 2015, have been fully recognized as revenue at the time of completion, recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 7 years for 2015 and 10 years for 2014. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. For this reason, as well as due to the personnel-related costs associated with providing implementation services, our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of related revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services.\nSegment Gross Profit\n Employer gross profit increased by $17.5 million, or 107.9%, between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015. The $32.8 million, or 52.9%, increase in employer revenue was offset by a $15.4 million, or 33.5%, increase in employer cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of employer customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations. Our employer gross profit included $4.6 million and $3.5 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. In addition, our employer gross profit included $1.0 million and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCarrier gross profit increased by $14.9 million, or 44.0%, between the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $14.9 million, or 19.8%, increase in carrier revenue and no change in carrier cost of revenue. Carrier cost of revenue was flat between year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2015 as efforts shifted to the employer segment to support the growth in employer customers which resulted in fewer costs allocated to carrier cost of revenue. Our carrier gross profit included $4.5 million in depreciation and amortization in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. In addition, our carrier gross profit included $0.9 million and $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $10.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.5 million, due to sales and marketing associates hired to continue driving revenue growth. We experienced additional increases of $0.4 million in costs related to facilities and overhead allocation, recruiting, professional fees and other operating costs. These increases were offset by decreases in costs related to sales and marketing events of $0.6 million and travel-related costs of $0.5 million.\nThe increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $6.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.0 million, due to growth in the number of research and development associates. Additionally, we\nexperienced a $3.0 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $0.8 million related to increases in other operating costs and facilities and overhead allocation driven by an increase in the number of employees.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable $3.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including a $1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to increased headcount. We also experienced a to a $2.5 million increase in consulting and professional fees and insurance related to being a publicly traded company. In addition, we experienced a $1.1 million increase related primarily to increases in facilities and overhead costs.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\n Growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, as the number of large employer and carrier customers increased to 596 as of December 31, 2014 from 433 as of December 31, 2013. Our professional services revenue increased in absolute terms between the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to revenue recognized from newly completed implementations of $3.2 million in addition to $2.1 million from the acceleration of the customer relationship period for customers that did not renew their contracts.\nSegment Revenue\n The growth in our employer revenue was primarily attributable to a $20.0 million increase in our employer software services revenue driven primarily by an increase in the number of large employer customers using our platform as of December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013. Additionally, employer professional services contributed an increase of $1.4 million primarily related to newly completed implementations.\nThe growth in our carrier revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of $7.3 million in our carrier software services revenue driven primarily by an increase in software services revenue from recent customer product implementations during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The remaining increase of $4.0 million is related to carrier\nprofessional services and is comprised of an increase of $1.9 million in revenue related to customers who went live on the platform and $2.1 million related to the acceleration of the customer relationship period for customers that did not renew their contracts.\nCost of Revenue\n The increase in cost of revenue was in part attributable to an $18.6 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs and professional fees, including an increase of $0.7 million related to stock-based compensation, of which $16.0 million was associated with increased client service capacity to support our growing number of customers and an increase in engineering costs of $1.2 million. Also, we experienced a $6.4 million increase in infrastructure maintenance costs to support our platform and additional depreciation and amortization and facilities costs related to the increase in the number of employees.\nGross Profit\n The increase in software services gross profit in absolute terms was driven by a $27.4 million, or 28.0%, increase in software services revenue. This increase was partially offset by a $13.7 million, or 37.9%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $0.4 million and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $7.2 million and $6.7 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe increase in professional services gross loss was driven by an $11.4 million, or 43.3%, increase in professional services cost of revenue, partially offset by an increase in professional services revenue of $5.3 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $0.5 million and $0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $0.8 million and $0.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As discussed in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Cost of Revenue\u201d, our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship, which is 10 years for the years presented. Therefore, the cost incurred in providing these services is expensed in periods prior to the\nrecognition of the corresponding revenue. For this reason, as well as due to the personnel-related costs associated with providing implementation services, our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of related revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services.\nSegment Gross Profit\n Employer gross profit increased in absolute terms by $2.9 million, or 21.6%, between the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014. The $21.4 million, or 52.5%, increase in employer revenue was offset by an $18.5 million, or 67.6%, increase in employer cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of employer customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations. Our employer gross profit included $3.5 million and $2.5 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In addition, our employer gross profit included $0.5 million and $0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCarrier gross profit increased by $4.7 million, or 16.3%, between the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014. The $11.3 million, or 17.6%, increase in carrier revenue was offset by a $6.6 million, or 18.7%, increase in carrier cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is attributable to costs associated with supporting the increased number of carrier customers live on the platform and the increased cost of providing services, including customer implementations. Our carrier gross profit included $4.5 million and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In addition, our carrier gross profit included $0.4 million and $0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $7.7 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.2 million, due to sales and marketing associates hired to continue driving revenue growth and $1.8 million related to sales and marketing events, $1.9 million related to increases in facilities and overhead allocation, recruiting and other operating costs driven by an increase in the number of employees, and $0.8 million in travel-related costs.\nThe increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $10.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, due to additional research and development headcount. Additionally, we experienced a $5.5 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $1.8 million related to increases in facilities and overhead allocation, other operating costs, and travel-related costs driven by an increase in the number of employees.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in consulting and professional fees and insurance related to being a publicly traded company, including $0.7 million in costs related to our follow-on offering on July 17, 2014. We also experienced a $3.0 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, including a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to increased headcount. In addition, we experienced a $1.2 million increase related primarily to increases in facilities and overhead costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from software services fees, which consist primarily of monthly subscription fees paid by customers for access to and usage of our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We also derive revenue from professional services which primarily include fees related to the integration of customers' systems with our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration, deployment, testing, and training.\nWe recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our cloud-based software services has commenced once it has granted the customer access to our platform.\nOur arrangements generally contain multiple elements comprised of software services and professional services. We evaluate each element in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy\nto use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement fee is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.\nEffective July 1, 2015, we determined that we had established standalone value for Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment as they are now sold separately from the software services. This was primarily due to the system integrators that have been trained and certified to perform these implementation services, the successful completion of an implementation by a trained system integrator, and the sale of several software subscription arrangements to customers in the Employer segment without our implementation services prior to July 1, 2015. Accordingly, revenues related to implementation services for the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution in the Employer segment that are delivered after July 1, 2015 are recognized separately from the revenues earned from the Employer software subscription services. Revenues related to such implementation services are recognized at the time that the professional services have been completed. Prior to July 1, 2015, we did not have standalone value for implementation services related to the Benefitfocus Marketplace solution as we had historically performed these services to support customers' implementation of this solution. The incremental revenue from recognition of services upon delivery compared to recognition over the customer relationship period of 7 years was $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain of our other professional services, including implementation services related to the Carrier segment, are not sold separately from the software services and there is no alternative use for them. As such, we have determined that those professional services do not have standalone value. Accordingly, software services and professional services are combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting. We generally recognize software services fees monthly based on the number of employees covered by the relevant benefits plans at contracted rates for a specified period of time, once the criteria for revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. We recognize revenue on Benefitfocus Marketplace implementation services in the Employer segment that have standalone value at the time the services have been completed. We defer recognition of revenue for fees from professional services that do not have standalone value and begin recognizing such revenue once the services are delivered and the related software services have commenced, ratably over the longer of the contract term or the estimated expected life of the customer relationship. Costs incurred by us in connection with providing such professional services are charged to expense as incurred and are included in \u201cCost of revenue.\u201d\nIn January 2015, we adjusted the estimated expected life of the customer relationship period for both segments. This change in estimate was the result of analyzing recent quantitative and qualitative observations in the market and factors impacting our business. This change in estimate shortened the term over which deferred revenue is recognized from 10 to 7 years and was applied prospectively to unamortized professional services fees over the longer of the contract term or the adjusted estimated expected life of the customer relationship.\nThe change in the customer relationship period increased the amount of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, which decreased both loss from continuing operations and net loss by $6,207 and decreased loss per share by $0.22 for the year. As a result of the change in the customer relationship period, Employer and Carrier revenue increased by $1,137 and $5,070, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns\nWe state accounts receivable at realizable value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts that we maintain for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due. We base our estimated allowance on our analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations. Historically, our actual collection experience has not varied significantly from our estimates, due primarily to our credit and collection policies and the financial strength of our customers.\nThe allowances for returns are accounted for as reductions of revenue and are estimated based on the Company's periodic assessment of historical experience and trends. The Company considers factors such as the time lag since the initiation of revenue recognition, historical reasons for adjustments, new customer volume, complexity of billing arrangements, timing of software availability, and past due customer billings.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first perform an assessment of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company-specific events, changes in strategy and circumstances, revenue, and operating margins. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the relevant reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. In step one, we determine if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the unit's carrying value. If step one indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform step two, determining the fair value of goodwill and, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, recording an impairment charge.\nWe have determined that we have two operating segments, employer and carrier. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of an appropriate discount rate, estimated terminal value and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued two types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based awards granted to associates, directors, and non-associate third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period of the option award. Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting over the following 36 months. We previously granted options that vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant date over 4 years.\nIn 2015, we granted performance restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets. Compensation expense for performance restricted stock units, which\nare accounted for as equity awards, is recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the award will vest. Significant judgment is involved in assessing the probability of achieving performance measures.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-Based Compensation Grants\nPrior to our IPO, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. We have periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, \u201cValuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,\u201d or the Practice Aid. When determining the fair market value of our common stock, we considered what we believe to be comparable publicly traded companies, discounted free cash flows, and an analysis of our enterprise value.\nSince our IPO, we determined fair value for restricted stock unit awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant or, if not a trading day, the trading day preceding the grant date.\nThe determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation arrangements is affected by a number of variables, including estimates of the fair value of our common stock, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the expected life of the award. We value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions. Black-Scholes and other option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the period indicated (we did not grant any stock options in 2015 or 2014):\n We have assumed no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, which is consistent with our past practice. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected life of our associate stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We used the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The list of comparable companies we used to determine expected volatility was consistent with those used to determine the corresponding fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\nWe based our estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures, or forfeiture rate, on our analysis of historical behavior by stock award holders. We apply the estimated forfeiture rate to the total estimated fair value\nof the awards, as derived from the Black-Scholes model, to compute the stock-based compensation expense, net of pre-vesting forfeitures, to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBased upon our closing stock price on December 31, 2015 of $36.39, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015 was $48.4 million, of which $45.8 million related to vested options and $2.6 million to unvested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2015 was $37.0 million, of which all were unvested.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling $48.1 million and $40.4 million in marketable securities, $29.7 million in accounts receivables, net of allowance, and unused revolving line of credit of $29.8 million. The terms of our revolving line of credit are described in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn September 23, 2013, we closed our IPO in which we sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $26.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $70.1 million. See Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding our IPO.\nIn February 2015, the Company replaced its existing revolving line of credit (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) with a senior revolving line of credit (the \u201cSenior Revolver\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders led by the existing lender. The three-year Senior Revolver has a borrowing limit of $60.0 million. Borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolver is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under the Senior Revolver may be less than the $60.0 million borrowing limit. The outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver was repaid with proceeds from the Senior Revolver and the Revolver was terminated. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the Senior Revolver bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on our liquidity that ranges between 1.0% and 1.5%. We are charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate based on our liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nWe are bound by customary affirmative and negative covenants in connection with the Senior Revolver, including financial covenants related to liquidity and EBITDA. In the event of a default, the lenders may declare all obligations immediately due and stop advancing money or extending credit under the line of credit. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and the equity of our subsidiaries.\nOn February 24, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell shares of our common stock to Mercer, one of our customers. Pursuant to the agreement, on the same date, we sold 2,817,526 shares of our common stock to Mercer for $26.50 per share or an aggregate of approximately $74.7 million. At the same time, we also issued Mercer a warrant to purchase up to an additional 580,813 shares of our common stock for $26.50 per share at any time during the 30-month term of the warrant. The agreement, among other things, includes certain standstill provisions and prevents Mercer from disposing of its shares of our common stock until the earlier of December 31, 2017, the expiration or termination of the Mercer Exchange Software as a Service Agreement, as amended between us and Mercer Health & Benefits, LLC, the date on which Mercer and its affiliates own less than 75% of the shares it purchased pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the date on which Mercer and its affiliates own less than 5% of our outstanding common stock. We received all of the proceeds from this sale of shares and will use the proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nBased on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nGoing forward, we may access capital markets to raise additional equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were as follows:\n Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations decreased $12.7 million during 2015 to $(31.5) million, as changes in working capital provided $1.3 million cash and adjustments for non-cash items of $29.3 million partially offset a net loss of $(62.1) million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $3.0 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $3.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $7.8 million. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable are\nthe result of timing of the receipt of invoices and the timing of payments. The increase in accounts receivable resulted from a few significant invoices related to new contracts and the normal timing of customer payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our operating activities used $18.9 million of cash, as $24.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $19.5 million in adjustments for non-cash items, were more than offset by a net loss of $63.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $9.5 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $5.6 million, change in fair value and accretion of warrant of $0.7 million, and accrual of interest on financing obligations of $3.6 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $14.3 million, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.2 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $2.5 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.4 million. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue, ratably over the customer relationship period, beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from an increase in the number of associates. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted from normal timing of customer payments. The increase in accrued expenses resulted from an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities of $1.1 million consisted of a net loss of $30.4 million more than offset by $19.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $12.1 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $8.2 million, accrued interest on financing obligation of $1.8 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.2 million, and a change in fair value and accretion of warrant of $0.9 million. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $22.7 million, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $4.5 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the customer relationship period beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accrued compensation and benefits resulted from normal fluctuation in payroll dates and an increase in the number of associates. The increase in accounts payable resulted from an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to a $10.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our revenue and fees.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $50.2 million for 2015 as net purchases of marketable securities were $35.5 million and cash purchases of property and equipment were $14.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $2.0 million for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was $9.8 million partially offset by the cash provided by net maturity of short-term investments held to maturity of $7.9 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $22.1 million for 2013. We purchased corporate bonds in the amount of $13.2 million. In addition, we spent $8.9 million to purchase property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $78.8 million, primarily as a result of $74.5 million from the issuance of common stock and a warrant in a private placement to Mercer, and net draws on the revolving line of credit of $12.6 million offset by payments on financing and capital lease obligations of $9.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million, consisting of a $14.0 million draw on revolving line of credit and $2.8 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options, offset by $8.2 million in payments on financing and capital lease obligations and payments on revolving line of credit of $2.1 million.\nOn March 28, 2014, a major customer exercised its warrant through a cashless exercise in accordance with the warrant's terms, resulting in the issuance of 455,521 shares of common stock. The measured value of the warrant became fully recognized against revenue in October 2014.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $67.0 million for 2013, which resulted primarily from $70.1 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of issuance costs, $12.2 million in proceeds from line of credit and notes payable borrowings and $0.7 million from exercises of stock options, partially offset by $15.8 million in repayments of notes payable, line of credit, and financing and capital lease obligations and $0.3 million in payments of contingent consideration.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We might require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional capital might not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding credit facilities, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment and purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\n\n (1) Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in 2018. Early repayment is allowed. Interest is paid monthly. \nIn February 2015, the Company replaced the Revolver with the Senior Revolver involving a syndicate of lenders led by the existing lender. The three-year Senior Revolver has a borrowing limit of $60.0 million. Borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolver is subject to a borrowing base limit that is a function of our monthly recurring revenue as adjusted to reflect lost customer revenue during the previous three calendar months. Therefore, credit available under the Senior Revolver may be less than the $60.0 million borrowing limit. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the Senior Revolver bear interest at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus a margin based on our liquidity that ranges between 1.0% and 1.5%. We are charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate based on our liquidity of 0.300% to 0.375% per year. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nOn December 13, 2013, we entered into a 15-year build-to-suit lease for additional office space at our Charleston, South Carolina campus. The rentable area of the constructed building is approximately 145,000 square feet and the lease commenced on January 1, 2015. Aggregate minimum payments under the arrangement total $77.1 million are included in the contractual obligations table above. Under this lease agreement we executed an option to lease two additional adjacent buildings. The annual cost of the option is $466,000 per year for term of the option, which is three years. Additionally, we may incur a termination fee if we terminate the option or let the option expire. The termination fee of $757,000 will be prorated through the date of termination or expiration. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized a liability related to the option in the amount of $488,000. No amounts have been recognized related the to the termination fee. However, if we had terminated the option effective December 31, 2015, we would have incurred expense in the amount of $517,000.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, other than as disclosed in Note 15, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance or special purpose entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which amends the revenue recognition requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This statement requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The statement shall be applied using one of two methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet determined which method we will apply. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with an option to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \u201cInterest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\u201d The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance\nis effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2015, with an option to early adopt. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16 \u201cBusiness Combinations-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d, which updated guidance regarding business combinations that requires an acquirer to recognize post-close measurement adjustments for provisional amounts in the period the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. The acquirer is also required to recognize, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the provisional amount, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The updated guidance is to be applied prospectively effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In connection with business combinations which have already been completed, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position.\nWe are evaluating other accounting standards and exposure drafts that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
