The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The line titled reportable segment totals\u201d, however, is a non-GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses segment operating profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, to better leverage its scale and presence across a larger geography and market, and to reduce administrative costs, the Company merged the North America and Latin America segments into one segment named the Americas. This change in segment reporting for the Americas is aligned with the Company's internal approach to managing, reporting, and evaluating performance of this region.\nFinancial information regarding the Company's reportable segments is as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

$167 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher shipments and higher prices.\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $81 million lower in 2017 than the prior year primarily due to higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher segment operating profit. Segment operating profit for reportable segments increased by $60 million compared to the prior year. For 2017, segment operating profit in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, exceeded prior year amounts.\nNet interest expense in 2017 decreased $4 million compared to 2016. Net interest expense included $18 million and $9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense decreased $13 million in 2017 primarily due to deleveraging and refinancing actions.\nFor 2017, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $183 million, or $1.11 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), for 2016. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company by $254 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2017 and $160 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2016.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales in 2017 were $6,869 million compared with $6,702 million in 2016, an increase of $167 million, or approximately 3%. Higher selling prices benefited net sales by $61 million in 2017. Total glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up approximately 1% in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in approximately $3 million of lower sales. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to a stronger Euro, Brazilian real, Colombian peso, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, increased sales by $106 million.\nThe change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal effect on net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Net sales in Europe in 2017 were $2,375 million compared with $2,300 million in 2016, an increase of $75 million, or 3%. Net sales in 2017 were benefited by a 1% increase in glass container shipments driven by higher shipments to beer, spirits and wine customers. This increased net sales by $28 million compared to the prior year. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $57 million, as the Euro strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. As a result of the pass through of 2016 cost deflation to customers under contractual price adjustment formulas, selling prices in Europe were $10 million lower in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nNorth America: Net sales in North America in 2017 were $2,160 million compared with $2,220 million in 2016, a decrease of $60 million, or 3%. Slightly higher selling prices increased net sales by $21 million in 2017. Total glass shipments in the region were down 3% in 2017 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower sales to beer customers. These lower shipments and an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $84 million of lower sales. This impact to sales mix was partially due to several customers converting a portion of their glass shipments from carton packaging to bulk shipments. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $3 million, as the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nLatin America: Net sales in Latin America in 2017 were $1,551 million compared with $1,432 million in 2016, an increase of $119 million, or 8%. Strong shipments in Mexico and higher shipments in Brazil drove total glass container shipments in the region up 4% in 2017 compared to the prior year and this increased sales by $52 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales $29 million in 2017, principally due to a strengthening of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Higher pricing increased net sales by $38 million in 2017.\nAsia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2017 were $714 million compared with $684 million in 2016, an increase of $30 million, or 4%. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates changes during 2017, primarily due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar, increased net sales by $17 million. Glass container shipments were down 1% in 2017 as higher shipments to food customers were more than offset by lower shipments to beer and non-alcoholic beverage customers. This resulted in a slightly favorable sales mix, which contributed to $1 million of higher sales in 2017. Slightly higher selling prices also increased net sales by $12 million in 2017.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $275 million in 2017 compared with $356 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $81 million, or 23%. This decrease was primarily due to higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher segment operating profit.\nOperating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments' operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment operating profit of reportable segments in 2017 was $942 million compared to $882 million in 2016, an increase of $60 million, or 7%. Higher selling prices increased segment operating profit by $61 million and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $11 million in 2017. Partially offsetting this was $12 million of higher operating costs.\nThe change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal net effect on segment operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2017 was $263 million compared with $237 million in 2016, an increase of $26 million, or 11%. Operating costs were $25 million lower in 2017 than the prior year period due to cost savings initiatives, benefits realized from a permanent footprint adjustment and cost deflation. The increase in sales volume discussed above improved segment operating profit by $6 million. Lower selling prices decreased segment operating profit in 2017 by $10 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $5 million in 2017.\nNorth America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2017 was $318 million compared with $299 million in 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 6%. Selling prices were $21 million higher in 2017 compared to the prior year. The unfavorable sales mix and lower shipments discussed above decreased segment operating profit by $19 million. Operating costs in 2017 were lower than the same period in the prior year and this increased segment operating profit by $12 million. Higher cost inflation in 2017 was more than offset by cost reductions, logistics savings and higher equity earnings from the Company's joint-venture with Constellation Brands ( Constellation Brands\u201d) in Mexico. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in the North American region. In prior years, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in retained corporate costs and other as it was mostly in construction mode. In addition, approximately $5 million in gains related to non-strategic asset sales were recognized by the region in 2017.\nLatin America: Segment operating profit in Latin America in 2017 was $296 million compared with $269 million in 2016, an increase of $27 million, or 10%. Despite significant benefits from cost savings initiatives, substantial cost inflation and the nonoccurrence of gains on non-strategic asset sales recorded in the prior year increased operating costs by $28 million in 2017. Offsetting these declines were higher selling prices that increased segment operating profit in 2017 by $38 million. The increase in sales volume discussed above benefited segment operating profit by $12 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $5 million in 2017.\nAsia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2017 was $65 million compared with $77 million in 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 16%. Despite cost containment efforts, cost inflation, higher supply chain costs and higher costs related to asset improvement projects in the region increased operating costs and decreased\nsegment operating profit by $30 million in 2017. Costs associated with these asset improvement projects are planned to continue and will result in lower segment operating profit in the first half of 2018 in the region than the same period in 2017. Also, in 2017, higher selling prices increased segment operating profit by $12 million and the change in sales volume and mix discussed above increased segment operating profit by $1 million. In addition, the region recorded $4 million of gain related to a land sale in 2017. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $1 million in 2017.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2017 was $268 million compared with $272 million in 2016. Net interest expense included $18 million and $9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense decreased $13 million in 2017 primarily due to deleveraging and refinancing actions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 was 25.5%, compared with 33.4% for 2016. The Company's effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than 2016 primarily due to the resolution of a tax matter that resulted in approximately $26 million of tax accruals reversed in 2017.\nExcluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 was approximately 21%, compared with approximately 24% for 2016. The rate for 2017 was lower than 2016 due to favorable resolution of certain tax matters during 2017.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017 was $22 million compared to $21 million for 2016.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company\nFor 2017, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $183 million, or $1.11 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), for 2016. The after tax effects of the items excluded from segment operating profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2017 and 2016 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDescription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension settlement charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(218)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(98)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring, asset impairment and other charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(77)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(129)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNote repurchase premiums and write-off of finance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTax benefit for certain tax adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet benefit (charge) for income tax on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet impact of noncontrolling interests on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on China land sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(254)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(160)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nGiven the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As described above, the Company's reported revenues and segment operating profit in 2017 were increased due to foreign currency effects compared to 2016.\nThis trend may not continue into 2018. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and segment operating profit of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nExecutive Overview-Comparison of 2016 with 2015\n2016 Highlights\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Company's acquisition on September 1, 2015 (the Vitro Acquisition\u201d) of the food and beverage glass container business of Vitro S.A.B. de C.V. and its subsidiaries (together Vitro\u201d) as constructed in the U.S., Mexico and Bolivia (the Vitro Business\u201d) increased net sales by $608 million and segment operating profit by $122 million in 2016 compared to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales in 2016 were $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year, primarily due to incremental net sales from the Vitro Acquisition.

The increase was largely attributable to approximately $122 million of incremental segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro Business. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit. Partially offsetting this was the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher operating costs due to cost inflation.\nNet interest expense in 2016 increased $21 million compared to 2015. Net interest expense included $9 million and $42 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense increased $54 million in the current year primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the Vitro Acquisition.\nFor 2016, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $139 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted), for 2015. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company by $160 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2016 and $186 million, or $1.15 per share, in 2015.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of 2016 with 2015\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales in 2016 were $6,702 million compared with $6,156 million in 2015, an increase of $546 million, or 9%. Driven by incremental shipments related to the Vitro Acquisition, total glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up approximately 9% in 2016 compared to 2015. The Vitro Acquisition resulted in approximately $608 million of additional sales. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition, shipments in 2016 were comparable to 2015. On a global basis, sales volumes of beer, wine, spirits, food and non-alcoholic\nbeverages all grew year-on-year. However, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $41 million of lower net sales in 2016. Net sales also benefited from $79 million in higher selling prices in 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Canadian dollar and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar, impacted sales by $108 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume (excluding acquisitions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(41)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(108)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVitro Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal effect on net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Net sales in Europe in 2016 were $2,300 million compared with $2,324 million in 2015, a decrease of $24 million, or 1%. The primary reason for the decline in net sales in 2016 was a $28 million impact due to foreign currency exchange rates, as the British pound weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar. Glass container shipments in 2016, primarily to beer and wine customers, increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year and this increased net sales by $30 million. Selling prices decreased in Europe due to competitive pressures and resulted in a $26 million decrease in net sales in 2016. This trend in lower prices is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2017.\nNorth America: Net sales in North America in 2016 were $2,220 million compared with $2,039 million in 2015, an increase of $181 million, or 9%. Net sales from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business in the United States increased the region's net sales by $196 million in 2016. Total glass container shipments were up nearly 7% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquired business and higher shipments in all major end uses except beer, which was on par with prior year. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition in the region, glass container shipments were up nearly 1% in 2016, however, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $36 million of lower sales. This impact to sales mix was due to several customers converting a portion of their glass shipments from carton packaging to bulk shipments. Higher selling prices as a result of contractual pass throughs increased net sales by $25 million in 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales by $4 million, as the Canadian dollar weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nLatin America: Net sales in Latin America in 2016 were $1,432 million compared with $1,064 million in 2015, an increase of $368 million, or 35%. Net sales from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business in Mexico and Bolivia increased the region's net sales by approximately $412 million in 2016. Total glass container shipments were up approximately 41% in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition in the region, glass container shipments were down approximately 3% in 2016. This decline impacted net sales by approximately $40 million and was primarily due to a general economic slowdown in Brazil and Ecuador, which is expected to continue into 2017, partially offset by growth in Colombia and Peru. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales $75 million in 2016 compared to 2015, principally due to a decline in the Brazilian real, Colombian peso, and the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Improved pricing in the current year benefited net sales by $71 million.\nAsia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2016 were $684 million compared with $671 million for 2015, an increase of $13 million, or 2%. Glass container shipments were down approximately 3% compared to the prior year, however, a slightly more favorable sales mix increased net sales by $5 million in 2016. Sales volumes in mature markets in the region were higher than prior year, but production volumes in those countries were lower due to planned engineering activity. These lower production volumes in the mature markets were supported by importing from emerging markets in the region, which in turn, led to lower domestic sales in those markets. Higher prices increased net sales by $9 million in the current year. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales $1 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $356 million in 2016 compared to $268 million in 2015, an increase of $88 million, or 33%. This increase was primarily due to higher segment operating profit, partially offset by higher retained corporate costs and higher net interest expense.\nOperating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments' operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment operating profit of reportable segments in 2016 was $882 million compared to $740 million in 2015, an increase of $142 million, or 19%. The increase was largely attributable to approximately $122 million of segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro Business. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit by $79 million. Partially offsetting this was the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($26 million) and higher operating costs ($25 million), primarily due to inflation.\nThe change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume (excluding acquisitions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVitro Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal net effect on segment operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2016 was $237 million compared with $209 million in 2015, an increase of $28 million, or 13%. The increase in sales volume discussed above improved segment operating profit by $7 million. Segment operating profit also benefited from $51 million in lower operating costs in 2016 than in the prior year due to energy deflation and improved operational performance. In 2015, production volumes were lower due to asset optimization projects that have now been completed. In addition, the region received an energy credit of approximately $10 million from a local government entity in 2016 that had been delayed for legislative reasons in 2015. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, especially the British pound, decreased segment operating profit by $14 million in 2016 compared to the prior year. Lower selling prices also decreased segment operating profit by $26 million.\nNorth America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2016 was $299 million compared with $265 million in 2015, an increase of $34 million, or 13%. Segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro food and beverage glass container distribution business in the region contributed $28 million of incremental profit in 2016. Higher selling prices as a result of contractual pass throughs increased segment operating profit by $25 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher production volumes and improved operating efficiencies were more than offset by cost inflation. Together, this contributed to a $13 million reduction to segment operating profit in 2016. The unfavorable sales mix discussed above reduced segment operating profit by $5 million. Also, the unfavorable effects of the weakening of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar decreased segment operating profit by $1 million.\nLatin America: Segment operating profit in Latin America in 2016 was $269 million compared with $183 million in 2015, an increase of $86 million, or 47%. Segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business contributed approximately $94 million of incremental profit to the region in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition, the decline in sales volume discussed above reduced segment operating profit by $13 million. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, especially the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and Mexican peso, decreased segment operating profit by $14 million in the current year.\nDespite management interventions to contain costs and improve asset optimization, segment operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by $57 million of higher operating costs, primarily due to energy and soda ash inflation in the region. Partially offsetting these declines were higher selling prices that increased segment operating profit by $71 million in 2016. In addition, approximately $5 million of gains related to non-strategic asset sales benefited 2016.\nAsia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2016 was $77 million compared with $83 million in 2015, a decrease of $6 million, or 7%. Cost inflation, higher production downtime due to furnace rebuild activity and higher costs for intra-regional shipments drove operating costs $21 million higher in 2016 compared to the prior year. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $3 million in 2016. The more favorable sales mix discussed above improved segment operating profit by $3 million. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit by $9 million in the current year.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2016 was $272 million compared with $251 million in 2015. Net interest expense included $9 million and $42 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense increased $54 million in the current year primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the Vitro Acquisition.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 was 33.4%, compared with 39.6% for 2015. The Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than 2015 due to the impact of significant costs related to refinancing, restructuring and acquisition-related costs in 2015 within jurisdictions that generated little or no tax benefit.\nExcluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was approximately 24%, compared with approximately 25% for 2015.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016 was $21 million compared to $23 million for 2015. The decrease in 2016 was largely attributable to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company\nFor 2016, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $139 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted), for 2015. The after tax effects of the items excluded from segment operating profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2016 and 2015 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDescription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring, asset impairment and other charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(129)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(80)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension settlement charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(98)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNote repurchase premiums and write-off of finance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on China land sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTax benefit (charge) for certain tax adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet benefit (charge) for income tax on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet impact of noncontrolling interests on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStrategic transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(23)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCharge for asbestos-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition-related fair value inventory adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition-related fair value intangible adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(160)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(186)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nGiven the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As described above, the Company's reported revenues and segment operating profit in 2016 were reduced due to foreign currency effects compared to 2015.\nThis trend has continued into 2017 as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and segment operating profit of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nItems Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals\nRetained Corporate Costs and Other\nRetained corporate costs and other for 2017 were $104 million compared with $98 million for 2016. These costs were higher in 2017 primarily due to lower equity earnings from the Company's joint-venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in the North America region. In prior years, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in Retained Corporate Costs and Other as it was mostly in construction mode.\nRetained corporate costs and other for 2016 were $98 million compared with $70 million for 2015. These costs were higher in 2016 primarily due to pension expense, management incentive compensation expense and the impact from currency hedges.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded charges totaling $77 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $72 million of plant and furnace closures, primarily in the Latin America and Europe regions and other charges of $5 million.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges totaling $129 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $98 million of plant and furnace closures, primarily in the European and Latin America regions. In addition, other charges of $31 million were recorded during 2017, primarily related to an impairment charge recorded at one of the Company's equity investments.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges totaling $80 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $63 million of completed furnace closures, primarily in the North America and Latin America regions and other charges of $17 million.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPension Settlement Charges\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded charges totaling $218 million for pension settlements in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges totaling $98 million for pension settlements in the United States.\nSee Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCharge for Asbestos-Related Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no adjustment required for asbestos-related costs, compared to the charge of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the Company's comprehensive annual legal review of asbestos-related liabilities and costs. As part of its future comprehensive annual reviews, the Company will estimate its total asbestos-related liability and such reviews may result in adjustments to the liability accrued at the time of the review. The Company continues to believe that its ultimate asbestos-related liability cannot be estimated with certainty.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGain on China Land Compensation\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $71 million related to compensation received for land that the Company was required to return to the Chinese government.\nAcquisition-related Fair Value Adjustments and Strategic Transaction Costs\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges of $23 million for strategic transaction costs related to the Vitro Acquisition.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges of $22 million for acquisition-related fair value inventory adjustments related to the Vitro Acquisition. These charges were due to the accounting rules requiring inventory purchased in a business combination to be marked up to fair value and then recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold. During 2015, the Company also recorded charges of $10 million for acquisition-related fair value intangible asset adjustments related to trademark assets with short-term lives acquired as part of the Vitro Acquisition.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn April 4, 2016, the annulment committee formed by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID\u201d) ruled that OI European Group B.V. ( OIEG\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, is free to pursue the enforcement of a prior arbitration award (the Award\u201d) against Venezuela. As of December 31, 2017, that Award amounts to more than $500 million, including reimbursement of expenses and accrued\ninterest. Venezuela's application to annul the Award was heard by an ad hoc committee of the ICSID in September 2017, but no decision has been rendered yet.\nOn July 31, 2017, OIEG sold its right, title and interest in amounts due under the Award to an Ireland-domiciled investment fund. Under the terms of the sale, OIEG received a payment, in cash, at closing equal to $115 million (the Cash Payment\u201d). OIEG may also receive additional payments in the future ( Deferred Amounts\u201d) calculated based on the total compensation that is received from Venezuela as a result of collection efforts or as settlement of the Award with Venezuela. In the event that the Award is partially or completely annulled by the ICSID ad hoc annulment committee, OIEG may be required to repay to the purchaser up to the entire amount of the Cash Payment based on a formula tied to the amount of the Award (if any) that is annulled. In addition, OIEG's right to receive any Deferred Amounts is subject to the limitations described below.\nOIEG's interest in any amounts received in the future from Venezuela in respect of the Award is limited to a percentage of such recovery after taking into account reimbursement of the Cash Payment to the purchaser and reimbursement of legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company and the purchaser. OIEG's percentage of such recovery will also be reduced over time. Because the Award has yet to be satisfied, the annulment proceeding is pending, and the ability to successfully enforce the Award in countries that are party to the ICSID Convention is subject to significant challenges, the Company is unable to reasonably predict the amount of recoveries from the Award, if any, to which the Company may be entitled in the future. Any future amounts that the Company may receive from the Award are highly speculative and the timing of any such future payments, if any, is highly uncertain. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any future payments under the Award beyond the Cash Payment. Except as noted above in connection with the annulment proceeding that is pending before the ICSID ad hoc committee, the Cash Payment is not subject to any forfeiture or future adjustment.\nA separate arbitration involving other subsidiaries of the Company was initiated in 2012 to obtain compensation primarily for third-party minority shareholders' lost interests in the two expropriated plants. However, in November 2017, ICSID issued an award that dismissed this arbitration on jurisdiction grounds. The Company is currently exploring potential next steps.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company deferred the gain contingency on the sale of its rights in amounts due under the Award pending the ad hoc committee of the ICSID rendering its decision regarding Venezuela's application to annul the Award.\nThe loss from discontinued operations of $3 million and $7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to ongoing costs for the Venezuelan expropriation.\nVitro Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2015, the Company completed the Vitro Acquisition in a cash transaction valued at approximately $2.297 billion, subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments. The Vitro Business in Mexico is the largest supplier of glass containers in that country, manufacturing glass containers across multiple end uses, including food, soft drinks, beer, wine and spirits. The Vitro Acquisition included five food and beverage glass container plants in Mexico, a plant in Bolivia and a North American distribution business, and provided the Company with a competitive position in the glass packaging market in Mexico. The results of the Vitro Business have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since September 1, 2015. Vitro's food and beverage glass container operations in Mexico and Bolivia are included in the Latin American operating segment while its distribution business is included in the North American operating segment.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and total debt of $492 million and $5.3 billion, respectively, compared to $492 million and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. A significant\nportion of the cash was held in mature, liquid markets where the Company has operations, such as the U.S., Europe and Australia, and is readily available to fund global liquidity requirements. The amount of cash held in non-U.S. locations as of December 31, 2017 was $451 million.\nCurrent and Long-Term Debt\nOn April 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, which subsequently has been amended several times with the most recent amendment being entered into on September 28, 2017 (the Amended Agreement\u201d).\nAt December 31, 2017, the Amended Agreement includes a $300 million revolving credit facility, a $600 million multicurrency revolving credit facility and a $1,575 million term loan A facility ($1,148 million net of debt issuance costs), each of which has a final maturity date of April 22, 2020. At December 31, 2017, the Company had unused credit of $888 million available under the Amended Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Amended Agreement at December 31, 2017 was 3.17%.\nThe Amended Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, engage in certain affiliate transactions, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, and amend certain subordinated debt obligations.\nThe Amended Agreement also contains one financial covenant, a Total Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents ( Net Indebtedness\u201d), by consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Agreement. The Total Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing or acquisitions to the extent that such financing or acquisitions would cause the Total Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum of 4.0x for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter.\nOn September 28, 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 ( Amendment No. 5\u201d) to the Amended Agreement. Amendment No. 5 changes the calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio by excluding from the calculation of Net Indebtedness ordinary course revolver borrowings (except to the extent such borrowings existed at the prior year end) and non-recourse factoring or securitization debt.\nFailure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Amended Agreement. In such an event, the Company would be unable to request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Amended Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Amended Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Amended Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Amended Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Amended Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions.\nThe interest rates on borrowings under the Amended Agreement are, at the Company's option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loan A facility and the revolving credit facility is linked to the Company's Total Leverage Ratio and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum linked to the Total Leverage Ratio.\nBorrowings under the Amended Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets, excluding real estate and certain other excluded assets, of certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings are also secured by a pledge of intercompany debt and equity investments in certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and, in the case of foreign borrowings, of stock of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. All borrowings under the Amended Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company.\nDuring November 2016, the Company issued senior notes with a face value of \u20ac500 million that bear interest at 3.125% and are due November 15, 2024 (the Senior Notes due 2024\u201d). The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $520 million and were used to repay the term loan B facility under the Amended Agreement. In March 2017, the Company expanded its borrowings under the Senior Notes due 2024 by issuing \u20ac225 million of additional notes that bear interest at 3.125% and are due November 15, 2024. The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $237 million and were used to repay a portion of the Company's revolving credit facility.\nDuring March 2017, the Company purchased in a tender offer approximately $228 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.80% Senior Debentures due in 2018. In November 2017, the remaining $22 million of the 7.80% Senior Debentures were repurchased by the Company, the indenture relating thereto was discharged, and all collateral and guarantees thereunder were released. The Company recorded $18 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of unamortized finance fees related to these actions.\nDuring December 2017, the Company issued senior notes with a face value of $310 million that bear interest at 4.000% and are due March 15, 2023. The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $305 million and were used to repay a portion of the term loan A facility under the Amended Agreement.\nIn order to maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating-rate debt, the Company has entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe Company assesses its capital raising and refinancing needs on an ongoing basis and may enter into additional credit facilities and seek to issue equity and/or debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets if market conditions are favorable. Also, depending on market conditions, the Company may elect to repurchase portions of its debt securities in the open market.\nThe Company has a \u20ac185 million European accounts receivable securitization program, which extends through March 2019, subject to periodic renewal of backup credit lines.\nInformation related to the Company's accounts receivable securitization program as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance (included in short-term loans)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.76\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.74\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nOperating activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $724 million for 2017 compared to $758 million for 2016. The decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in working capital of $89 million compared to a decrease of $90 million in 2016. This increase in working capital in 2017 was primarily due to the nonreccurrence of a $128 million refund the Company received in 2016 on value added taxes previously paid in conjunction with an acquisition. Lower pension contributions and asbestos-related payments were more than offset by higher amounts of cash paid for restructuring activities in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nInvesting activities: Cash utilized in continuing investing activities was $466 million for 2017 compared to $417 million for 2016. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment during 2017 was $441 million, compared with $454 million in the prior year.\nAcquisition activities were $39 million and $56 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were primarily related to contributions made to the Company's joint venture with Constellation Brands in Nava, Mexico. In 2017, the Company received $14 million in net proceeds from the disposal of assets compared to $85 million in 2016. In 2016, these proceeds included the sale of land use rights in China that did not repeat in 2017. Also, in 2017, a subsidiary of the Company received $115 million from selling its right, title and interest in amounts due under a prior arbitration award against Venezuela related to a discontinued operation. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn October 2017, the Company signed an agreement to expand its joint venture with Constellation. To meet rising demand from Constellation's adjacent brewery, the newly-expanded relationship provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. This capacity expansion, which is estimated to cost approximately $140 million, will be financed by equal contributions from both partners throughout 2018 and 2019. The term of the joint venture agreement was also expanded for ten additional years, to 2034.\nFinancing activities: Cash utilized in financing activities was $392 million for 2017 compared to $228 million of cash utilized by financing activities for 2016. Financing activities in 2017 included additions to long-term debt of $1,458 million, which included the issuances of \u20ac225 million and $310 million of senior notes. Financing activities in 2017 also included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,764 million, which included the repayment of floating-rate debt in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility and the repurchase of the 2018 Senior Debentures. Financing activities in 2016 included additions to long-term debt of $1,235 million, which included the issuance of \u20ac500 million of senior notes. Financing activities in 2016 also included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,453 million, which included the repayment of floating-rate debt in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility. Borrowings under short-term loans decreased by $36 million in 2017. The Company paid approximately $28 million in note repurchase premiums and finance fees in 2017 compared to $9 million in 2016. The Company paid $17 million and $16 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn January 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a $400 million share repurchase program. The Company expects to repurchase approximately $100 million in shares of the Company's stock in 2018.\nThe Company anticipates that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Amended Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short-term (twelve months) and long-term basis. Based on the Company's expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Company's expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's liquidity on a short-term or long-term basis.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following information summarizes the Company's significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions).\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 -

Therefore, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nThe impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Company's reported and expected financial results.\nThe Company believes that accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation related to its asbestos liability, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment-The Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Company's business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a segment or a component of a segment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of PP&E based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nImpairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management's best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.\nGoodwill -Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). Step 1 compares the business enterprise value ( BEV\u201d) of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The BEV is computed based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third-party buyer. If the BEV is less than the carrying value for any reporting unit, then goodwill impairment must be calculated. Goodwill impairment will be calculated by comparing the reporting unit's fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. Any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value will be recorded as an impairment loss. The calculations of the BEV in Step 1 are based on significant unobservable inputs, such as projected future cash flows of the reporting units, discount rates, and terminal business value, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's projected future cash flows incorporates management's best estimates of the expected future results including, but not limited to, price trends, customer demand, material costs, asset replacement costs and any other known factors.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below the operating segment, also known as a component. Two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated into a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics, based on an assessment of various factors. The Company has determined that the Europe and North America segments are reporting units. The Company aggregated the components of the Latin America and Asia Pacific segments into single reporting units equal to the reportable segments. The aggregation of the components of these segments was based on their economic similarity as determined by the Company using a number of quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including gross margins, the manner in which the Company operates the business, the consistent nature of products, services, production processes, customers and methods of distribution, as well as the level of shared resources and assets between the components.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. Goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.6 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The Company has four reporting units of which three of the reporting units have goodwill and include; approximately $900 million of recorded goodwill to the Company's Europe segment, approximately $600 million of recorded goodwill to the Company's Latin America segment and approximately $1.1 billion of recorded goodwill to the Company's North America segment. The testing performed as of October 1, 2017, indicated a substantial excess of BEV over book value for Europe, North America and Latin America. If the Company's projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2017, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of these reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. Any impairment charges that the Company may take in the future could be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEV's would still have exceeded the book value of each of these reporting units.\nDuring the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at December 31, 2017, the Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting units may have been impaired and has determined that no such events have occurred. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2018 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2018, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth.\nOther Long-Lived Assets - Intangibles - Other long-lived assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships intangibles and are amortized using the accelerated amortization method over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an asset occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. The test for impairment would require the Company to make estimates about fair value, which may be determined based on discounted cash flows, third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of their assets.\nPension Benefit Plans\nSignificant Estimates-The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average discount rate was 3.69 % and 2.76 % for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively. The Company uses an expected long-term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans' assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans' assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short-term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long-term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2017, the Company's estimated weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 7.50% for U.S. plans and 6.32% for non-U.S. plans compared to 7.50% for U.S. plans and 7.15% for non-U.S. plans in 2016. The Company recorded pension expense from continuing operations (exclusive of settlement\ncharges) of $21 million, $23 million, and $24 million for the U.S. plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $8 million, $8 million, and $7 million for the non-U.S. plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $38 million of total pension expense for the full year of 2018. The 2018 pension expense will reflect a 7.25% and 5.52% expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. assets and non-U.S. assets, respectively.\nFuture effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one-half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities or in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a change of approximately $6 million and $11 million, respectively, in the pretax pension expense for the full year 2018.\nRecognition of Funded Status-The Company recognizes the funded status of each pension benefit plan on the balance sheet. The funded status of each plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income and the portion of each plan that exceeds 10% of the greater of that plan's assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees still accruing benefits or the expected life of participants not accruing benefits if all, or almost all, of the plan's participants are no longer accruing benefits.\nContingencies and Litigation Related to Asbestos Liability\nFor many years, the Company has conducted a comprehensive legal review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. As part of its current annual comprehensive legal review, the Company provides historical claims filing data to a third party consultant with expertise in predicting future claims filings based on actuarial inputs such as disease incidence and mortality. The Company uses these estimates of total future claims, along with its legal judgment regarding an estimation of future disposition costs and related legal costs, as inputs to develop a reasonable estimate of probable liability. If the results of the annual comprehensive legal review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is lower (higher) than its reasonably estimable asbestos-related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge (credit) to the Company's results of operations to increase (decrease) the accrued liability.\nThe significant assumptions underlying the material components of the Company's accrual are described in the Risk Factors section and in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these significant assumptions have the potential to impact the Company's asbestos-related liability.\nIn addition, if trends relating to the Company's actual claims filings materially differ, up or down, from the amounts predicted, the total number of estimated claims indicated by future actuarial analyses could change significantly. Significant changes in the total number of predicted claims could impact the total predicted asbestos-related liability, which in turn could result in a material charge or credit to the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company uses historical data for both indemnity and related legal costs, as well as its legal judgment and expectations about future inflationary and deflationary drivers, to predict the estimated disposition cost per claim and the legal costs for the remainder of the litigation. If trends relating to the actual per claim cost differ materially, up or down, from the previously estimated amount, the Company may in the future revise its estimate of its asbestos-related liability. The same may also be true with respect to legal costs. Significant changes in the estimated asbestos-related liability could result in a material charge or credit to the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss for its asbestos-related liabilities in excess of the amount currently recognized, which is $582 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company estimates that reasonably possible losses could result in asbestos-related liabilities up to $725 million. This estimate of additional reasonably possible loss reflects a qualitative legal judgment regarding the nature of contingencies that could impact future claims and legal costs, which include, but are not limited to, successful attempts by plaintiffs to challenge existing legal barriers to liability, enact plaintiff-oriented liability or damage-\nrelated legislation, establish new theories of liability, or revive long-dormant inventories of non-mesothelioma cases. However, it is also possible that the ultimate amount of asbestos-related liabilities could be above this estimate.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes as required by general accounting principles under which management judgment is required in determining income tax expense/(benefit) and the related balance sheet amounts. This judgment includes estimating and analyzing historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of taxable and tax deductible temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions. The Company has received tax assessments in excess of established reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company is contesting these tax assessments, and will continue to do so, including pursuing all available remedies such as appeals and litigation, if necessary.\nThe Company believes that adequate provisions for all income tax uncertainties have been made. However, if tax assessments are settled against the Company at amounts in excess of established reserves, it could have a material impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used for calculating income tax expense and potential differences in actual results from estimates could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and for tax attributes such as operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction on a separate or on a consolidated tax filing basis, as applicable, in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The Company considers the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ntaxable income in prior carryback years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfuture taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies that the Company would be willing to undertake to prevent a deferred tax asset from otherwise expiring.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or whether a change in judgment regarding the valuation allowance has occurred also considers all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnature, frequency, and severity of cumulative losses in recent years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nduration of statutory carryforward and carryback periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nstatutory limitations against utilization of tax attribute carryforwards against taxable income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhistorical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnear and medium term financial outlook.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in\nrecent years. The Company uses the actual results for the last two years and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.\nThe evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The recognition of deferred tax assets represents the Company's best estimate of those future events. Changes in the current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain tax jurisdictions, the Company's analysis indicates that it has cumulative losses in recent years. This is considered significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable and, therefore, difficult to overcome. However, the cumulative loss position is not solely determinative and, accordingly, the Company considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based on its analysis, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets where based on the weight of available evidence it is unlikely to realize those deferred tax assets.\nBased on the evidence available including a lack of sustainable earnings, the Company in its judgment previously recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its net deferred tax assets in the United States. If a change in judgment regarding this valuation allowance were to occur in the future, the Company will record a potentially material deferred tax benefit, which could result in a favorable impact on the effective tax rate in that period. The utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income reduces the amount of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, allows filers to use prior year methodologies or estimates of the anticipated current impact of the Act in the preparation of their 2017 financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, it has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In all cases, the Company will continue to make and refine its calculations as additional data is gathered and further analysis is completed. In addition, the Company's estimates may also be affected as it gains a more thorough understanding of the tax law and certain aspects of the Act are clarified by the taxing authorities. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of tax expense (benefit) in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets was a net tax charge of $162 million, which was fully offset by an adjustment to valuation allowance. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $11 million for the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to an indefinite lived intangible asset. The Act did not change the Company's judgment regarding the realizability of these net deferred tax assets.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and for which no deferred taxes were recorded since the Company previously claimed the indefinite reinvestment assertion exception on these earnings. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability of $2 million, net of foreign tax credits. The Company has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P and associated foreign tax credits for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. The Company anticipates that additional guidance and clarification regarding the implementation\nof the transition tax will be issued by federal and state taxing authorities and this estimate is, therefore, subject to future refinement.\nNo additional income taxes (other than those related to the foreign earnings inclusion taxable under the transition tax) have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts provisionally continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company provisionally continues to apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the Act being enacted since the Company cannot complete its analysis of whether a change in its indefinite reinvestment assertion would occur until additional guidance is available and the transition tax liability computation is complete.\nThe Company has elected to treat Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) which is effective in 2018 for the Company as a period cost.\nAdditional guidance is likely to be issued providing further clarification on the application of the Act. Further, it is reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the U.S. legislation. This additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, could have a material adverse impact on net income and cash flow by impacting significant deductions or income inclusions.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\u2003MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's measure of profit for its reportable segments is segment operating profit, which consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The line titled reportable segment totals\u201d, however, is a non-GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses segment operating profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, to better leverage its scale and presence across a larger geography and market, and to reduce administrative costs, the Company merged the North America and Latin America segments into one segment named the Americas. This change in segment reporting for the Americas is aligned with the Company's internal approach to managing, reporting, and evaluating performance of this region.\nFinancial information regarding the Company's reportable segments is as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Highlights\n \u00b7 Net sales were up nearly 3% compared to the prior year, driven by higher shipments, higher prices and the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates \n \u00b7 Driven by higher shipments and progress on strategic initiatives, segment operating profit was higher in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, compared to the prior year \n \u00b7 Issued \u20ac225 million and $310 million of senior notes and repaid higher-cost debt \n \u00b7 Received $115 million from selling the Company's right, title and interest in amounts due under a prior arbitration award in Venezuela \nNet sales increased by $167 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher shipments and higher prices.\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $81 million lower in 2017 than the prior year primarily due to higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher segment operating profit. Segment operating profit for reportable segments increased by $60 million compared to the prior year. For 2017, segment operating profit in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, exceeded prior year amounts.\nNet interest expense in 2017 decreased $4 million compared to 2016. Net interest expense included $18 million and $9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense decreased $13 million in 2017 primarily due to deleveraging and refinancing actions.\nFor 2017, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $183 million, or $1.11 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), for 2016. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company by $254 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2017 and $160 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2016.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales in 2017 were $6,869 million compared with $6,702 million in 2016, an increase of $167 million, or approximately 3%. Higher selling prices benefited net sales by $61 million in 2017. Total glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up approximately 1% in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in approximately $3 million of lower sales. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to a stronger Euro, Brazilian real, Colombian peso, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, increased sales by $106 million.\nThe change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal effect on net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Net sales in Europe in 2017 were $2,375 million compared with $2,300 million in 2016, an increase of $75 million, or 3%. Net sales in 2017 were benefited by a 1% increase in glass container shipments driven by higher shipments to beer, spirits and wine customers. This increased net sales by $28 million compared to the prior year. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $57 million, as the Euro strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. As a result of the pass through of 2016 cost deflation to customers under contractual price adjustment formulas, selling prices in Europe were $10 million lower in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nNorth America: Net sales in North America in 2017 were $2,160 million compared with $2,220 million in 2016, a decrease of $60 million, or 3%. Slightly higher selling prices increased net sales by $21 million in 2017. Total glass shipments in the region were down 3% in 2017 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower sales to beer customers. These lower shipments and an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $84 million of lower sales. This impact to sales mix was partially due to several customers converting a portion of their glass shipments from carton packaging to bulk shipments. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $3 million, as the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nLatin America: Net sales in Latin America in 2017 were $1,551 million compared with $1,432 million in 2016, an increase of $119 million, or 8%. Strong shipments in Mexico and higher shipments in Brazil drove total glass container shipments in the region up 4% in 2017 compared to the prior year and this increased sales by $52 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales $29 million in 2017, principally due to a strengthening of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Higher pricing increased net sales by $38 million in 2017.\nAsia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2017 were $714 million compared with $684 million in 2016, an increase of $30 million, or 4%. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates changes during 2017, primarily due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar, increased net sales by $17 million. Glass container shipments were down 1% in 2017 as higher shipments to food customers were more than offset by lower shipments to beer and non-alcoholic beverage customers. This resulted in a slightly favorable sales mix, which contributed to $1 million of higher sales in 2017. Slightly higher selling prices also increased net sales by $12 million in 2017.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $275 million in 2017 compared with $356 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $81 million, or 23%. This decrease was primarily due to higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher segment operating profit.\nOperating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments' operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment operating profit of reportable segments in 2017 was $942 million compared to $882 million in 2016, an increase of $60 million, or 7%. Higher selling prices increased segment operating profit by $61 million and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $11 million in 2017. Partially offsetting this was $12 million of higher operating costs.\nThe change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal net effect on segment operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2017 was $263 million compared with $237 million in 2016, an increase of $26 million, or 11%. Operating costs were $25 million lower in 2017 than the prior year period due to cost savings initiatives, benefits realized from a permanent footprint adjustment and cost deflation. The increase in sales volume discussed above improved segment operating profit by $6 million. Lower selling prices decreased segment operating profit in 2017 by $10 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $5 million in 2017.\nNorth America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2017 was $318 million compared with $299 million in 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 6%. Selling prices were $21 million higher in 2017 compared to the prior year. The unfavorable sales mix and lower shipments discussed above decreased segment operating profit by $19 million. Operating costs in 2017 were lower than the same period in the prior year and this increased segment operating profit by $12 million. Higher cost inflation in 2017 was more than offset by cost reductions, logistics savings and higher equity earnings from the Company's joint-venture with Constellation Brands ( Constellation Brands\u201d) in Mexico. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in the North American region. In prior years, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in retained corporate costs and other as it was mostly in construction mode. In addition, approximately $5 million in gains related to non-strategic asset sales were recognized by the region in 2017.\nLatin America: Segment operating profit in Latin America in 2017 was $296 million compared with $269 million in 2016, an increase of $27 million, or 10%. Despite significant benefits from cost savings initiatives, substantial cost inflation and the nonoccurrence of gains on non-strategic asset sales recorded in the prior year increased operating costs by $28 million in 2017. Offsetting these declines were higher selling prices that increased segment operating profit in 2017 by $38 million. The increase in sales volume discussed above benefited segment operating profit by $12 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $5 million in 2017.\nAsia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2017 was $65 million compared with $77 million in 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 16%. Despite cost containment efforts, cost inflation, higher supply chain costs and higher costs related to asset improvement projects in the region increased operating costs and decreased\nsegment operating profit by $30 million in 2017. Costs associated with these asset improvement projects are planned to continue and will result in lower segment operating profit in the first half of 2018 in the region than the same period in 2017. Also, in 2017, higher selling prices increased segment operating profit by $12 million and the change in sales volume and mix discussed above increased segment operating profit by $1 million. In addition, the region recorded $4 million of gain related to a land sale in 2017. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $1 million in 2017.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2017 was $268 million compared with $272 million in 2016. Net interest expense included $18 million and $9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense decreased $13 million in 2017 primarily due to deleveraging and refinancing actions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 was 25.5%, compared with 33.4% for 2016. The Company's effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than 2016 primarily due to the resolution of a tax matter that resulted in approximately $26 million of tax accruals reversed in 2017.\nExcluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 was approximately 21%, compared with approximately 24% for 2016. The rate for 2017 was lower than 2016 due to favorable resolution of certain tax matters during 2017.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017 was $22 million compared to $21 million for 2016.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company\nFor 2017, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $183 million, or $1.11 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), for 2016. The after tax effects of the items excluded from segment operating profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2017 and 2016 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDescription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension settlement charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(218)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(98)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring, asset impairment and other charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(77)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(129)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNote repurchase premiums and write-off of finance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTax benefit for certain tax adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet benefit (charge) for income tax on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet impact of noncontrolling interests on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on China land sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(254)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(160)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nGiven the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As described above, the Company's reported revenues and segment operating profit in 2017 were increased due to foreign currency effects compared to 2016.\nThis trend may not continue into 2018. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and segment operating profit of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nExecutive Overview-Comparison of 2016 with 2015\n2016 Highlights\n \u00b7 The Company's acquisition on September 1, 2015 (the Vitro Acquisition\u201d) of the food and beverage glass container business of Vitro S.A.B. de C.V. and its subsidiaries (together Vitro\u201d) as constructed in the U.S., Mexico and Bolivia (the Vitro Business\u201d) increased net sales by $608 million and segment operating profit by $122 million in 2016 compared to 2015 \n \u00b7 Net sales in 2016 were $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year, primarily due to incremental net sales from the Vitro Acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, shipments were comparable in both periods \n \u00b7 Driven by the Vitro Acquisition and progress on strategic initiatives, segment operating profit was higher in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, in 2016 compared to the prior year \n \u00b7 Issued \u20ac500 million of senior notes due 2024 and repaid higher-cost floating-rate debt \nNet sales increased by $546 million compared to the prior year primarily due to approximately $608 million of incremental net sales from the Vitro Acquisition and slightly higher pricing, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable sales mix.\nSegment operating profit for reportable segments increased by $142 million compared to the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to approximately $122 million of incremental segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro Business. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit. Partially offsetting this was the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher operating costs due to cost inflation.\nNet interest expense in 2016 increased $21 million compared to 2015. Net interest expense included $9 million and $42 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense increased $54 million in the current year primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the Vitro Acquisition.\nFor 2016, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $139 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted), for 2015. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company by $160 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2016 and $186 million, or $1.15 per share, in 2015.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of 2016 with 2015\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales in 2016 were $6,702 million compared with $6,156 million in 2015, an increase of $546 million, or 9%. Driven by incremental shipments related to the Vitro Acquisition, total glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up approximately 9% in 2016 compared to 2015. The Vitro Acquisition resulted in approximately $608 million of additional sales. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition, shipments in 2016 were comparable to 2015. On a global basis, sales volumes of beer, wine, spirits, food and non-alcoholic\nbeverages all grew year-on-year. However, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $41 million of lower net sales in 2016. Net sales also benefited from $79 million in higher selling prices in 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Canadian dollar and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar, impacted sales by $108 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume (excluding acquisitions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(41)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(108)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVitro Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal effect on net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales- 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Net sales in Europe in 2016 were $2,300 million compared with $2,324 million in 2015, a decrease of $24 million, or 1%. The primary reason for the decline in net sales in 2016 was a $28 million impact due to foreign currency exchange rates, as the British pound weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar. Glass container shipments in 2016, primarily to beer and wine customers, increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year and this increased net sales by $30 million. Selling prices decreased in Europe due to competitive pressures and resulted in a $26 million decrease in net sales in 2016. This trend in lower prices is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2017.\nNorth America: Net sales in North America in 2016 were $2,220 million compared with $2,039 million in 2015, an increase of $181 million, or 9%. Net sales from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business in the United States increased the region's net sales by $196 million in 2016. Total glass container shipments were up nearly 7% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquired business and higher shipments in all major end uses except beer, which was on par with prior year. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition in the region, glass container shipments were up nearly 1% in 2016, however, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $36 million of lower sales. This impact to sales mix was due to several customers converting a portion of their glass shipments from carton packaging to bulk shipments. Higher selling prices as a result of contractual pass throughs increased net sales by $25 million in 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales by $4 million, as the Canadian dollar weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nLatin America: Net sales in Latin America in 2016 were $1,432 million compared with $1,064 million in 2015, an increase of $368 million, or 35%. Net sales from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business in Mexico and Bolivia increased the region's net sales by approximately $412 million in 2016. Total glass container shipments were up approximately 41% in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition in the region, glass container shipments were down approximately 3% in 2016. This decline impacted net sales by approximately $40 million and was primarily due to a general economic slowdown in Brazil and Ecuador, which is expected to continue into 2017, partially offset by growth in Colombia and Peru. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales $75 million in 2016 compared to 2015, principally due to a decline in the Brazilian real, Colombian peso, and the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Improved pricing in the current year benefited net sales by $71 million.\nAsia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2016 were $684 million compared with $671 million for 2015, an increase of $13 million, or 2%. Glass container shipments were down approximately 3% compared to the prior year, however, a slightly more favorable sales mix increased net sales by $5 million in 2016. Sales volumes in mature markets in the region were higher than prior year, but production volumes in those countries were lower due to planned engineering activity. These lower production volumes in the mature markets were supported by importing from emerging markets in the region, which in turn, led to lower domestic sales in those markets. Higher prices increased net sales by $9 million in the current year. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales $1 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $356 million in 2016 compared to $268 million in 2015, an increase of $88 million, or 33%. This increase was primarily due to higher segment operating profit, partially offset by higher retained corporate costs and higher net interest expense.\nOperating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments' operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment operating profit of reportable segments in 2016 was $882 million compared to $740 million in 2015, an increase of $142 million, or 19%. The increase was largely attributable to approximately $122 million of segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro Business. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit by $79 million. Partially offsetting this was the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($26 million) and higher operating costs ($25 million), primarily due to inflation.\nThe change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales volume (excluding acquisitions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffects of changing foreign currency rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVitro Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal net effect on segment operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment operating profit - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2016 was $237 million compared with $209 million in 2015, an increase of $28 million, or 13%. The increase in sales volume discussed above improved segment operating profit by $7 million. Segment operating profit also benefited from $51 million in lower operating costs in 2016 than in the prior year due to energy deflation and improved operational performance. In 2015, production volumes were lower due to asset optimization projects that have now been completed. In addition, the region received an energy credit of approximately $10 million from a local government entity in 2016 that had been delayed for legislative reasons in 2015. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, especially the British pound, decreased segment operating profit by $14 million in 2016 compared to the prior year. Lower selling prices also decreased segment operating profit by $26 million.\nNorth America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2016 was $299 million compared with $265 million in 2015, an increase of $34 million, or 13%. Segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro food and beverage glass container distribution business in the region contributed $28 million of incremental profit in 2016. Higher selling prices as a result of contractual pass throughs increased segment operating profit by $25 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher production volumes and improved operating efficiencies were more than offset by cost inflation. Together, this contributed to a $13 million reduction to segment operating profit in 2016. The unfavorable sales mix discussed above reduced segment operating profit by $5 million. Also, the unfavorable effects of the weakening of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar decreased segment operating profit by $1 million.\nLatin America: Segment operating profit in Latin America in 2016 was $269 million compared with $183 million in 2015, an increase of $86 million, or 47%. Segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business contributed approximately $94 million of incremental profit to the region in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition, the decline in sales volume discussed above reduced segment operating profit by $13 million. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, especially the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and Mexican peso, decreased segment operating profit by $14 million in the current year.\nDespite management interventions to contain costs and improve asset optimization, segment operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by $57 million of higher operating costs, primarily due to energy and soda ash inflation in the region. Partially offsetting these declines were higher selling prices that increased segment operating profit by $71 million in 2016. In addition, approximately $5 million of gains related to non-strategic asset sales benefited 2016.\nAsia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2016 was $77 million compared with $83 million in 2015, a decrease of $6 million, or 7%. Cost inflation, higher production downtime due to furnace rebuild activity and higher costs for intra-regional shipments drove operating costs $21 million higher in 2016 compared to the prior year. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $3 million in 2016. The more favorable sales mix discussed above improved segment operating profit by $3 million. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit by $9 million in the current year.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2016 was $272 million compared with $251 million in 2015. Net interest expense included $9 million and $42 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense increased $54 million in the current year primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the Vitro Acquisition.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 was 33.4%, compared with 39.6% for 2015. The Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than 2015 due to the impact of significant costs related to refinancing, restructuring and acquisition-related costs in 2015 within jurisdictions that generated little or no tax benefit.\nExcluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was approximately 24%, compared with approximately 25% for 2015.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016 was $21 million compared to $23 million for 2015. The decrease in 2016 was largely attributable to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company\nFor 2016, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $139 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted), for 2015. The after tax effects of the items excluded from segment operating profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2016 and 2015 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDescription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring, asset impairment and other charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(129)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(80)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension settlement charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(98)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNote repurchase premiums and write-off of finance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on China land sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTax benefit (charge) for certain tax adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet benefit (charge) for income tax on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet impact of noncontrolling interests on items above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStrategic transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(23)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCharge for asbestos-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition-related fair value inventory adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition-related fair value intangible adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(160)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(186)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nGiven the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As described above, the Company's reported revenues and segment operating profit in 2016 were reduced due to foreign currency effects compared to 2015.\nThis trend has continued into 2017 as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and segment operating profit of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nItems Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals\nRetained Corporate Costs and Other\nRetained corporate costs and other for 2017 were $104 million compared with $98 million for 2016. These costs were higher in 2017 primarily due to lower equity earnings from the Company's joint-venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in the North America region. In prior years, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in Retained Corporate Costs and Other as it was mostly in construction mode.\nRetained corporate costs and other for 2016 were $98 million compared with $70 million for 2015. These costs were higher in 2016 primarily due to pension expense, management incentive compensation expense and the impact from currency hedges.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded charges totaling $77 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $72 million of plant and furnace closures, primarily in the Latin America and Europe regions and other charges of $5 million.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges totaling $129 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $98 million of plant and furnace closures, primarily in the European and Latin America regions. In addition, other charges of $31 million were recorded during 2017, primarily related to an impairment charge recorded at one of the Company's equity investments.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges totaling $80 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $63 million of completed furnace closures, primarily in the North America and Latin America regions and other charges of $17 million.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPension Settlement Charges\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded charges totaling $218 million for pension settlements in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges totaling $98 million for pension settlements in the United States.\nSee Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCharge for Asbestos-Related Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no adjustment required for asbestos-related costs, compared to the charge of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the Company's comprehensive annual legal review of asbestos-related liabilities and costs. As part of its future comprehensive annual reviews, the Company will estimate its total asbestos-related liability and such reviews may result in adjustments to the liability accrued at the time of the review. The Company continues to believe that its ultimate asbestos-related liability cannot be estimated with certainty.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGain on China Land Compensation\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $71 million related to compensation received for land that the Company was required to return to the Chinese government.\nAcquisition-related Fair Value Adjustments and Strategic Transaction Costs\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges of $23 million for strategic transaction costs related to the Vitro Acquisition.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges of $22 million for acquisition-related fair value inventory adjustments related to the Vitro Acquisition. These charges were due to the accounting rules requiring inventory purchased in a business combination to be marked up to fair value and then recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold. During 2015, the Company also recorded charges of $10 million for acquisition-related fair value intangible asset adjustments related to trademark assets with short-term lives acquired as part of the Vitro Acquisition.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn April 4, 2016, the annulment committee formed by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID\u201d) ruled that OI European Group B.V. ( OIEG\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, is free to pursue the enforcement of a prior arbitration award (the Award\u201d) against Venezuela. As of December 31, 2017, that Award amounts to more than $500 million, including reimbursement of expenses and accrued\ninterest. Venezuela's application to annul the Award was heard by an ad hoc committee of the ICSID in September 2017, but no decision has been rendered yet.\nOn July 31, 2017, OIEG sold its right, title and interest in amounts due under the Award to an Ireland-domiciled investment fund. Under the terms of the sale, OIEG received a payment, in cash, at closing equal to $115 million (the Cash Payment\u201d). OIEG may also receive additional payments in the future ( Deferred Amounts\u201d) calculated based on the total compensation that is received from Venezuela as a result of collection efforts or as settlement of the Award with Venezuela. In the event that the Award is partially or completely annulled by the ICSID ad hoc annulment committee, OIEG may be required to repay to the purchaser up to the entire amount of the Cash Payment based on a formula tied to the amount of the Award (if any) that is annulled. In addition, OIEG's right to receive any Deferred Amounts is subject to the limitations described below.\nOIEG's interest in any amounts received in the future from Venezuela in respect of the Award is limited to a percentage of such recovery after taking into account reimbursement of the Cash Payment to the purchaser and reimbursement of legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company and the purchaser. OIEG's percentage of such recovery will also be reduced over time. Because the Award has yet to be satisfied, the annulment proceeding is pending, and the ability to successfully enforce the Award in countries that are party to the ICSID Convention is subject to significant challenges, the Company is unable to reasonably predict the amount of recoveries from the Award, if any, to which the Company may be entitled in the future. Any future amounts that the Company may receive from the Award are highly speculative and the timing of any such future payments, if any, is highly uncertain. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any future payments under the Award beyond the Cash Payment. Except as noted above in connection with the annulment proceeding that is pending before the ICSID ad hoc committee, the Cash Payment is not subject to any forfeiture or future adjustment.\nA separate arbitration involving other subsidiaries of the Company was initiated in 2012 to obtain compensation primarily for third-party minority shareholders' lost interests in the two expropriated plants. However, in November 2017, ICSID issued an award that dismissed this arbitration on jurisdiction grounds. The Company is currently exploring potential next steps.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company deferred the gain contingency on the sale of its rights in amounts due under the Award pending the ad hoc committee of the ICSID rendering its decision regarding Venezuela's application to annul the Award.\nThe loss from discontinued operations of $3 million and $7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to ongoing costs for the Venezuelan expropriation.\nVitro Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2015, the Company completed the Vitro Acquisition in a cash transaction valued at approximately $2.297 billion, subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments. The Vitro Business in Mexico is the largest supplier of glass containers in that country, manufacturing glass containers across multiple end uses, including food, soft drinks, beer, wine and spirits. The Vitro Acquisition included five food and beverage glass container plants in Mexico, a plant in Bolivia and a North American distribution business, and provided the Company with a competitive position in the glass packaging market in Mexico. The results of the Vitro Business have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since September 1, 2015. Vitro's food and beverage glass container operations in Mexico and Bolivia are included in the Latin American operating segment while its distribution business is included in the North American operating segment.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and total debt of $492 million and $5.3 billion, respectively, compared to $492 million and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. A significant\nportion of the cash was held in mature, liquid markets where the Company has operations, such as the U.S., Europe and Australia, and is readily available to fund global liquidity requirements. The amount of cash held in non-U.S. locations as of December 31, 2017 was $451 million.\nCurrent and Long-Term Debt\nOn April 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, which subsequently has been amended several times with the most recent amendment being entered into on September 28, 2017 (the Amended Agreement\u201d).\nAt December 31, 2017, the Amended Agreement includes a $300 million revolving credit facility, a $600 million multicurrency revolving credit facility and a $1,575 million term loan A facility ($1,148 million net of debt issuance costs), each of which has a final maturity date of April 22, 2020. At December 31, 2017, the Company had unused credit of $888 million available under the Amended Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Amended Agreement at December 31, 2017 was 3.17%.\nThe Amended Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, engage in certain affiliate transactions, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, and amend certain subordinated debt obligations.\nThe Amended Agreement also contains one financial covenant, a Total Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents ( Net Indebtedness\u201d), by consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Agreement. The Total Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing or acquisitions to the extent that such financing or acquisitions would cause the Total Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum of 4.0x for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter.\nOn September 28, 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 ( Amendment No. 5\u201d) to the Amended Agreement. Amendment No. 5 changes the calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio by excluding from the calculation of Net Indebtedness ordinary course revolver borrowings (except to the extent such borrowings existed at the prior year end) and non-recourse factoring or securitization debt.\nFailure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Amended Agreement. In such an event, the Company would be unable to request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Amended Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Amended Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Amended Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Amended Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Amended Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions.\nThe interest rates on borrowings under the Amended Agreement are, at the Company's option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loan A facility and the revolving credit facility is linked to the Company's Total Leverage Ratio and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum linked to the Total Leverage Ratio.\nBorrowings under the Amended Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets, excluding real estate and certain other excluded assets, of certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings are also secured by a pledge of intercompany debt and equity investments in certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and, in the case of foreign borrowings, of stock of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. All borrowings under the Amended Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company.\nDuring November 2016, the Company issued senior notes with a face value of \u20ac500 million that bear interest at 3.125% and are due November 15, 2024 (the Senior Notes due 2024\u201d). The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $520 million and were used to repay the term loan B facility under the Amended Agreement. In March 2017, the Company expanded its borrowings under the Senior Notes due 2024 by issuing \u20ac225 million of additional notes that bear interest at 3.125% and are due November 15, 2024. The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $237 million and were used to repay a portion of the Company's revolving credit facility.\nDuring March 2017, the Company purchased in a tender offer approximately $228 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.80% Senior Debentures due in 2018. In November 2017, the remaining $22 million of the 7.80% Senior Debentures were repurchased by the Company, the indenture relating thereto was discharged, and all collateral and guarantees thereunder were released. The Company recorded $18 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of unamortized finance fees related to these actions.\nDuring December 2017, the Company issued senior notes with a face value of $310 million that bear interest at 4.000% and are due March 15, 2023. The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $305 million and were used to repay a portion of the term loan A facility under the Amended Agreement.\nIn order to maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating-rate debt, the Company has entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe Company assesses its capital raising and refinancing needs on an ongoing basis and may enter into additional credit facilities and seek to issue equity and/or debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets if market conditions are favorable. Also, depending on market conditions, the Company may elect to repurchase portions of its debt securities in the open market.\nThe Company has a \u20ac185 million European accounts receivable securitization program, which extends through March 2019, subject to periodic renewal of backup credit lines.\nInformation related to the Company's accounts receivable securitization program as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance (included in short-term loans)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.76\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.74\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nOperating activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $724 million for 2017 compared to $758 million for 2016. The decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in working capital of $89 million compared to a decrease of $90 million in 2016. This increase in working capital in 2017 was primarily due to the nonreccurrence of a $128 million refund the Company received in 2016 on value added taxes previously paid in conjunction with an acquisition. Lower pension contributions and asbestos-related payments were more than offset by higher amounts of cash paid for restructuring activities in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nInvesting activities: Cash utilized in continuing investing activities was $466 million for 2017 compared to $417 million for 2016. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment during 2017 was $441 million, compared with $454 million in the prior year.\nAcquisition activities were $39 million and $56 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were primarily related to contributions made to the Company's joint venture with Constellation Brands in Nava, Mexico. In 2017, the Company received $14 million in net proceeds from the disposal of assets compared to $85 million in 2016. In 2016, these proceeds included the sale of land use rights in China that did not repeat in 2017. Also, in 2017, a subsidiary of the Company received $115 million from selling its right, title and interest in amounts due under a prior arbitration award against Venezuela related to a discontinued operation. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn October 2017, the Company signed an agreement to expand its joint venture with Constellation. To meet rising demand from Constellation's adjacent brewery, the newly-expanded relationship provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. This capacity expansion, which is estimated to cost approximately $140 million, will be financed by equal contributions from both partners throughout 2018 and 2019. The term of the joint venture agreement was also expanded for ten additional years, to 2034.\nFinancing activities: Cash utilized in financing activities was $392 million for 2017 compared to $228 million of cash utilized by financing activities for 2016. Financing activities in 2017 included additions to long-term debt of $1,458 million, which included the issuances of \u20ac225 million and $310 million of senior notes. Financing activities in 2017 also included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,764 million, which included the repayment of floating-rate debt in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility and the repurchase of the 2018 Senior Debentures. Financing activities in 2016 included additions to long-term debt of $1,235 million, which included the issuance of \u20ac500 million of senior notes. Financing activities in 2016 also included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,453 million, which included the repayment of floating-rate debt in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility. Borrowings under short-term loans decreased by $36 million in 2017. The Company paid approximately $28 million in note repurchase premiums and finance fees in 2017 compared to $9 million in 2016. The Company paid $17 million and $16 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn January 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a $400 million share repurchase program. The Company expects to repurchase approximately $100 million in shares of the Company's stock in 2018.\nThe Company anticipates that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Amended Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short-term (twelve months) and long-term basis. Based on the Company's expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Company's expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's liquidity on a short-term or long-term basis.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following information summarizes the Company's significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions).\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 -

In cases where variable prices are involved, current market prices have been used. The amount above does not include ordinary course of business purchase orders because the majority of such purchase orders may be canceled. The Company does not believe such purchase orders will adversely affect its liquidity position. \n (3) In order to maintain minimum funding requirements, the Company is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $35 million in 2018. Future funding requirements for the Company's pension plans will depend largely on actual asset returns and future actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, and can vary significantly. \n (4) In 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Constellation Brands to operate a glass container plant in Nava, Mexico. To help meet current and rising demand from Constellation's adjacent brewery, the joint venture plans to expand the plant over the next two years. The Company expects to contribute approximately $70 million for the joint venture's expansion plans through 2019. \nThe Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for its unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nThe impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Company's reported and expected financial results.\nThe Company believes that accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation related to its asbestos liability, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment-The Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Company's business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a segment or a component of a segment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of PP&E based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nImpairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management's best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.\nGoodwill -Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). Step 1 compares the business enterprise value ( BEV\u201d) of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The BEV is computed based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third-party buyer. If the BEV is less than the carrying value for any reporting unit, then goodwill impairment must be calculated. Goodwill impairment will be calculated by comparing the reporting unit's fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. Any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value will be recorded as an impairment loss. The calculations of the BEV in Step 1 are based on significant unobservable inputs, such as projected future cash flows of the reporting units, discount rates, and terminal business value, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's projected future cash flows incorporates management's best estimates of the expected future results including, but not limited to, price trends, customer demand, material costs, asset replacement costs and any other known factors.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below the operating segment, also known as a component. Two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated into a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics, based on an assessment of various factors. The Company has determined that the Europe and North America segments are reporting units. The Company aggregated the components of the Latin America and Asia Pacific segments into single reporting units equal to the reportable segments. The aggregation of the components of these segments was based on their economic similarity as determined by the Company using a number of quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including gross margins, the manner in which the Company operates the business, the consistent nature of products, services, production processes, customers and methods of distribution, as well as the level of shared resources and assets between the components.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. Goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.6 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The Company has four reporting units of which three of the reporting units have goodwill and include; approximately $900 million of recorded goodwill to the Company's Europe segment, approximately $600 million of recorded goodwill to the Company's Latin America segment and approximately $1.1 billion of recorded goodwill to the Company's North America segment. The testing performed as of October 1, 2017, indicated a substantial excess of BEV over book value for Europe, North America and Latin America. If the Company's projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2017, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of these reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. Any impairment charges that the Company may take in the future could be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEV's would still have exceeded the book value of each of these reporting units.\nDuring the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at December 31, 2017, the Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting units may have been impaired and has determined that no such events have occurred. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2018 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2018, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth.\nOther Long-Lived Assets - Intangibles - Other long-lived assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships intangibles and are amortized using the accelerated amortization method over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an asset occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. The test for impairment would require the Company to make estimates about fair value, which may be determined based on discounted cash flows, third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of their assets.\nPension Benefit Plans\nSignificant Estimates-The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average discount rate was 3.69 % and 2.76 % for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively. The Company uses an expected long-term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans' assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans' assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short-term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long-term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2017, the Company's estimated weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 7.50% for U.S. plans and 6.32% for non-U.S. plans compared to 7.50% for U.S. plans and 7.15% for non-U.S. plans in 2016. The Company recorded pension expense from continuing operations (exclusive of settlement\ncharges) of $21 million, $23 million, and $24 million for the U.S. plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $8 million, $8 million, and $7 million for the non-U.S. plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $38 million of total pension expense for the full year of 2018. The 2018 pension expense will reflect a 7.25% and 5.52% expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. assets and non-U.S. assets, respectively.\nFuture effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one-half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities or in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a change of approximately $6 million and $11 million, respectively, in the pretax pension expense for the full year 2018.\nRecognition of Funded Status-The Company recognizes the funded status of each pension benefit plan on the balance sheet. The funded status of each plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income and the portion of each plan that exceeds 10% of the greater of that plan's assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees still accruing benefits or the expected life of participants not accruing benefits if all, or almost all, of the plan's participants are no longer accruing benefits.\nContingencies and Litigation Related to Asbestos Liability\nFor many years, the Company has conducted a comprehensive legal review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. As part of its current annual comprehensive legal review, the Company provides historical claims filing data to a third party consultant with expertise in predicting future claims filings based on actuarial inputs such as disease incidence and mortality. The Company uses these estimates of total future claims, along with its legal judgment regarding an estimation of future disposition costs and related legal costs, as inputs to develop a reasonable estimate of probable liability. If the results of the annual comprehensive legal review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is lower (higher) than its reasonably estimable asbestos-related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge (credit) to the Company's results of operations to increase (decrease) the accrued liability.\nThe significant assumptions underlying the material components of the Company's accrual are described in the Risk Factors section and in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these significant assumptions have the potential to impact the Company's asbestos-related liability.\nIn addition, if trends relating to the Company's actual claims filings materially differ, up or down, from the amounts predicted, the total number of estimated claims indicated by future actuarial analyses could change significantly. Significant changes in the total number of predicted claims could impact the total predicted asbestos-related liability, which in turn could result in a material charge or credit to the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company uses historical data for both indemnity and related legal costs, as well as its legal judgment and expectations about future inflationary and deflationary drivers, to predict the estimated disposition cost per claim and the legal costs for the remainder of the litigation. If trends relating to the actual per claim cost differ materially, up or down, from the previously estimated amount, the Company may in the future revise its estimate of its asbestos-related liability. The same may also be true with respect to legal costs. Significant changes in the estimated asbestos-related liability could result in a material charge or credit to the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss for its asbestos-related liabilities in excess of the amount currently recognized, which is $582 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company estimates that reasonably possible losses could result in asbestos-related liabilities up to $725 million. This estimate of additional reasonably possible loss reflects a qualitative legal judgment regarding the nature of contingencies that could impact future claims and legal costs, which include, but are not limited to, successful attempts by plaintiffs to challenge existing legal barriers to liability, enact plaintiff-oriented liability or damage-\nrelated legislation, establish new theories of liability, or revive long-dormant inventories of non-mesothelioma cases. However, it is also possible that the ultimate amount of asbestos-related liabilities could be above this estimate.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes as required by general accounting principles under which management judgment is required in determining income tax expense/(benefit) and the related balance sheet amounts. This judgment includes estimating and analyzing historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of taxable and tax deductible temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions. The Company has received tax assessments in excess of established reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company is contesting these tax assessments, and will continue to do so, including pursuing all available remedies such as appeals and litigation, if necessary.\nThe Company believes that adequate provisions for all income tax uncertainties have been made. However, if tax assessments are settled against the Company at amounts in excess of established reserves, it could have a material impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used for calculating income tax expense and potential differences in actual results from estimates could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and for tax attributes such as operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction on a separate or on a consolidated tax filing basis, as applicable, in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The Company considers the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n \u00b7 taxable income in prior carryback years; \n \u00b7 future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; \n \u00b7 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; and \n \u00b7 prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that the Company would be willing to undertake to prevent a deferred tax asset from otherwise expiring. \nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or whether a change in judgment regarding the valuation allowance has occurred also considers all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to:\n \u00b7 nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative losses in recent years; \n \u00b7 duration of statutory carryforward and carryback periods; \n \u00b7 statutory limitations against utilization of tax attribute carryforwards against taxable income; \n \u00b7 historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and \n \u00b7 near and medium term financial outlook. \nThe weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in\nrecent years. The Company uses the actual results for the last two years and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.\nThe evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The recognition of deferred tax assets represents the Company's best estimate of those future events. Changes in the current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain tax jurisdictions, the Company's analysis indicates that it has cumulative losses in recent years. This is considered significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable and, therefore, difficult to overcome. However, the cumulative loss position is not solely determinative and, accordingly, the Company considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based on its analysis, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets where based on the weight of available evidence it is unlikely to realize those deferred tax assets.\nBased on the evidence available including a lack of sustainable earnings, the Company in its judgment previously recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its net deferred tax assets in the United States. If a change in judgment regarding this valuation allowance were to occur in the future, the Company will record a potentially material deferred tax benefit, which could result in a favorable impact on the effective tax rate in that period. The utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income reduces the amount of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, allows filers to use prior year methodologies or estimates of the anticipated current impact of the Act in the preparation of their 2017 financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, it has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In all cases, the Company will continue to make and refine its calculations as additional data is gathered and further analysis is completed. In addition, the Company's estimates may also be affected as it gains a more thorough understanding of the tax law and certain aspects of the Act are clarified by the taxing authorities. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of tax expense (benefit) in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets was a net tax charge of $162 million, which was fully offset by an adjustment to valuation allowance. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $11 million for the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to an indefinite lived intangible asset. The Act did not change the Company's judgment regarding the realizability of these net deferred tax assets.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and for which no deferred taxes were recorded since the Company previously claimed the indefinite reinvestment assertion exception on these earnings. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability of $2 million, net of foreign tax credits. The Company has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P and associated foreign tax credits for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. The Company anticipates that additional guidance and clarification regarding the implementation\nof the transition tax will be issued by federal and state taxing authorities and this estimate is, therefore, subject to future refinement.\nNo additional income taxes (other than those related to the foreign earnings inclusion taxable under the transition tax) have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts provisionally continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company provisionally continues to apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the Act being enacted since the Company cannot complete its analysis of whether a change in its indefinite reinvestment assertion would occur until additional guidance is available and the transition tax liability computation is complete.\nThe Company has elected to treat Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) which is effective in 2018 for the Company as a period cost.\nAdditional guidance is likely to be issued providing further clarification on the application of the Act. Further, it is reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the U.S. legislation. This additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, could have a material adverse impact on net income and cash flow by impacting significant deductions or income inclusions.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\u2003MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's measure of profit for its reportable segments is segment operating profit, which consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The line titled reportable segment totals\u201d, however, is a non-GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses segment operating profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, to better leverage its scale and presence across a larger geography and market, and to reduce administrative costs, the Company merged the North America and Latin America segments into one segment named the Americas. This change in segment reporting for the Americas is aligned with the Company's internal approach to managing, reporting, and evaluating performance of this region.\nFinancial information regarding the Company's reportable segments is as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n \n\nNote: all amounts excluded from reportable segment totals are discussed in the following applicable sections.\nExecutive Overview-Comparison of 2017 with 2016\n2017 Highlights\n \u00b7 Net sales were up nearly 3% compared to the prior year, driven by higher shipments, higher prices and the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates \n \u00b7 Driven by higher shipments and progress on strategic initiatives, segment operating profit was higher in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, compared to the prior year \n \u00b7 Issued \u20ac225 million and $310 million of senior notes and repaid higher-cost debt \n \u00b7 Received $115 million from selling the Company's right, title and interest in amounts due under a prior arbitration award in Venezuela \nNet sales increased by $167 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher shipments and higher prices.\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $81 million lower in 2017 than the prior year primarily due to higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher segment operating profit. Segment operating profit for reportable segments increased by $60 million compared to the prior year. For 2017, segment operating profit in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, exceeded prior year amounts.\nNet interest expense in 2017 decreased $4 million compared to 2016. Net interest expense included $18 million and $9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense decreased $13 million in 2017 primarily due to deleveraging and refinancing actions.\nFor 2017, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $183 million, or $1.11 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), for 2016. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company by $254 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2017 and $160 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2016.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales in 2017 were $6,869 million compared with $6,702 million in 2016, an increase of $167 million, or approximately 3%. Higher selling prices benefited net sales by $61 million in 2017. Total glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up approximately 1% in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in approximately $3 million of lower sales. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to a stronger Euro, Brazilian real, Colombian peso, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, increased sales by $106 million.\nThe change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nEurope: Net sales in Europe in 2017 were $2,375 million compared with $2,300 million in 2016, an increase of $75 million, or 3%. Net sales in 2017 were benefited by a 1% increase in glass container shipments driven by higher shipments to beer, spirits and wine customers. This increased net sales by $28 million compared to the prior year. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $57 million, as the Euro strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. As a result of the pass through of 2016 cost deflation to customers under contractual price adjustment formulas, selling prices in Europe were $10 million lower in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nNorth America: Net sales in North America in 2017 were $2,160 million compared with $2,220 million in 2016, a decrease of $60 million, or 3%. Slightly higher selling prices increased net sales by $21 million in 2017. Total glass shipments in the region were down 3% in 2017 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower sales to beer customers. These lower shipments and an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $84 million of lower sales. This impact to sales mix was partially due to several customers converting a portion of their glass shipments from carton packaging to bulk shipments. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $3 million, as the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nLatin America: Net sales in Latin America in 2017 were $1,551 million compared with $1,432 million in 2016, an increase of $119 million, or 8%. Strong shipments in Mexico and higher shipments in Brazil drove total glass container shipments in the region up 4% in 2017 compared to the prior year and this increased sales by $52 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales $29 million in 2017, principally due to a strengthening of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Higher pricing increased net sales by $38 million in 2017.\nAsia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2017 were $714 million compared with $684 million in 2016, an increase of $30 million, or 4%. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates changes during 2017, primarily due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar, increased net sales by $17 million. Glass container shipments were down 1% in 2017 as higher shipments to food customers were more than offset by lower shipments to beer and non-alcoholic beverage customers. This resulted in a slightly favorable sales mix, which contributed to $1 million of higher sales in 2017. Slightly higher selling prices also increased net sales by $12 million in 2017.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $275 million in 2017 compared with $356 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $81 million, or 23%. This decrease was primarily due to higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher segment operating profit.\nOperating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments' operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment operating profit of reportable segments in 2017 was $942 million compared to $882 million in 2016, an increase of $60 million, or 7%. Higher selling prices increased segment operating profit by $61 million and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $11 million in 2017. Partially offsetting this was $12 million of higher operating costs.\nThe change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nEurope: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2017 was $263 million compared with $237 million in 2016, an increase of $26 million, or 11%. Operating costs were $25 million lower in 2017 than the prior year period due to cost savings initiatives, benefits realized from a permanent footprint adjustment and cost deflation. The increase in sales volume discussed above improved segment operating profit by $6 million. Lower selling prices decreased segment operating profit in 2017 by $10 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $5 million in 2017.\nNorth America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2017 was $318 million compared with $299 million in 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 6%. Selling prices were $21 million higher in 2017 compared to the prior year. The unfavorable sales mix and lower shipments discussed above decreased segment operating profit by $19 million. Operating costs in 2017 were lower than the same period in the prior year and this increased segment operating profit by $12 million. Higher cost inflation in 2017 was more than offset by cost reductions, logistics savings and higher equity earnings from the Company's joint-venture with Constellation Brands ( Constellation Brands\u201d) in Mexico. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in the North American region. In prior years, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in retained corporate costs and other as it was mostly in construction mode. In addition, approximately $5 million in gains related to non-strategic asset sales were recognized by the region in 2017.\nLatin America: Segment operating profit in Latin America in 2017 was $296 million compared with $269 million in 2016, an increase of $27 million, or 10%. Despite significant benefits from cost savings initiatives, substantial cost inflation and the nonoccurrence of gains on non-strategic asset sales recorded in the prior year increased operating costs by $28 million in 2017. Offsetting these declines were higher selling prices that increased segment operating profit in 2017 by $38 million. The increase in sales volume discussed above benefited segment operating profit by $12 million. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $5 million in 2017.\nAsia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2017 was $65 million compared with $77 million in 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 16%. Despite cost containment efforts, cost inflation, higher supply chain costs and higher costs related to asset improvement projects in the region increased operating costs and decreased\nsegment operating profit by $30 million in 2017. Costs associated with these asset improvement projects are planned to continue and will result in lower segment operating profit in the first half of 2018 in the region than the same period in 2017. Also, in 2017, higher selling prices increased segment operating profit by $12 million and the change in sales volume and mix discussed above increased segment operating profit by $1 million. In addition, the region recorded $4 million of gain related to a land sale in 2017. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $1 million in 2017.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2017 was $268 million compared with $272 million in 2016. Net interest expense included $18 million and $9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense decreased $13 million in 2017 primarily due to deleveraging and refinancing actions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 was 25.5%, compared with 33.4% for 2016. The Company's effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than 2016 primarily due to the resolution of a tax matter that resulted in approximately $26 million of tax accruals reversed in 2017.\nExcluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 was approximately 21%, compared with approximately 24% for 2016. The rate for 2017 was lower than 2016 due to favorable resolution of certain tax matters during 2017.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017 was $22 million compared to $21 million for 2016.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company\nFor 2017, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $183 million, or $1.11 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), for 2016. The after tax effects of the items excluded from segment operating profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2017 and 2016 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nGiven the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As described above, the Company's reported revenues and segment operating profit in 2017 were increased due to foreign currency effects compared to 2016.\nThis trend may not continue into 2018. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and segment operating profit of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nExecutive Overview-Comparison of 2016 with 2015\n2016 Highlights\n \u00b7 The Company's acquisition on September 1, 2015 (the Vitro Acquisition\u201d) of the food and beverage glass container business of Vitro S.A.B. de C.V. and its subsidiaries (together Vitro\u201d) as constructed in the U.S., Mexico and Bolivia (the Vitro Business\u201d) increased net sales by $608 million and segment operating profit by $122 million in 2016 compared to 2015 \n \u00b7 Net sales in 2016 were $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year, primarily due to incremental net sales from the Vitro Acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, shipments were comparable in both periods \n \u00b7 Driven by the Vitro Acquisition and progress on strategic initiatives, segment operating profit was higher in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, in 2016 compared to the prior year \n \u00b7 Issued \u20ac500 million of senior notes due 2024 and repaid higher-cost floating-rate debt \nNet sales increased by $546 million compared to the prior year primarily due to approximately $608 million of incremental net sales from the Vitro Acquisition and slightly higher pricing, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable sales mix.\nSegment operating profit for reportable segments increased by $142 million compared to the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to approximately $122 million of incremental segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro Business. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit. Partially offsetting this was the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher operating costs due to cost inflation.\nNet interest expense in 2016 increased $21 million compared to 2015. Net interest expense included $9 million and $42 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense increased $54 million in the current year primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the Vitro Acquisition.\nFor 2016, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $139 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted), for 2015. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company by $160 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2016 and $186 million, or $1.15 per share, in 2015.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of 2016 with 2015\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales in 2016 were $6,702 million compared with $6,156 million in 2015, an increase of $546 million, or 9%. Driven by incremental shipments related to the Vitro Acquisition, total glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up approximately 9% in 2016 compared to 2015. The Vitro Acquisition resulted in approximately $608 million of additional sales. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition, shipments in 2016 were comparable to 2015. On a global basis, sales volumes of beer, wine, spirits, food and non-alcoholic\nbeverages all grew year-on-year. However, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $41 million of lower net sales in 2016. Net sales also benefited from $79 million in higher selling prices in 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Canadian dollar and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar, impacted sales by $108 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nEurope: Net sales in Europe in 2016 were $2,300 million compared with $2,324 million in 2015, a decrease of $24 million, or 1%. The primary reason for the decline in net sales in 2016 was a $28 million impact due to foreign currency exchange rates, as the British pound weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar. Glass container shipments in 2016, primarily to beer and wine customers, increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year and this increased net sales by $30 million. Selling prices decreased in Europe due to competitive pressures and resulted in a $26 million decrease in net sales in 2016. This trend in lower prices is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2017.\nNorth America: Net sales in North America in 2016 were $2,220 million compared with $2,039 million in 2015, an increase of $181 million, or 9%. Net sales from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business in the United States increased the region's net sales by $196 million in 2016. Total glass container shipments were up nearly 7% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquired business and higher shipments in all major end uses except beer, which was on par with prior year. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition in the region, glass container shipments were up nearly 1% in 2016, however, an unfavorable sales mix resulted in $36 million of lower sales. This impact to sales mix was due to several customers converting a portion of their glass shipments from carton packaging to bulk shipments. Higher selling prices as a result of contractual pass throughs increased net sales by $25 million in 2016. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales by $4 million, as the Canadian dollar weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nLatin America: Net sales in Latin America in 2016 were $1,432 million compared with $1,064 million in 2015, an increase of $368 million, or 35%. Net sales from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business in Mexico and Bolivia increased the region's net sales by approximately $412 million in 2016. Total glass container shipments were up approximately 41% in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition in the region, glass container shipments were down approximately 3% in 2016. This decline impacted net sales by approximately $40 million and was primarily due to a general economic slowdown in Brazil and Ecuador, which is expected to continue into 2017, partially offset by growth in Colombia and Peru. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales $75 million in 2016 compared to 2015, principally due to a decline in the Brazilian real, Colombian peso, and the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Improved pricing in the current year benefited net sales by $71 million.\nAsia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2016 were $684 million compared with $671 million for 2015, an increase of $13 million, or 2%. Glass container shipments were down approximately 3% compared to the prior year, however, a slightly more favorable sales mix increased net sales by $5 million in 2016. Sales volumes in mature markets in the region were higher than prior year, but production volumes in those countries were lower due to planned engineering activity. These lower production volumes in the mature markets were supported by importing from emerging markets in the region, which in turn, led to lower domestic sales in those markets. Higher prices increased net sales by $9 million in the current year. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales $1 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $356 million in 2016 compared to $268 million in 2015, an increase of $88 million, or 33%. This increase was primarily due to higher segment operating profit, partially offset by higher retained corporate costs and higher net interest expense.\nOperating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments' operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment operating profit of reportable segments in 2016 was $882 million compared to $740 million in 2015, an increase of $142 million, or 19%. The increase was largely attributable to approximately $122 million of segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro Business. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit by $79 million. Partially offsetting this was the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($26 million) and higher operating costs ($25 million), primarily due to inflation.\nThe change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nEurope: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2016 was $237 million compared with $209 million in 2015, an increase of $28 million, or 13%. The increase in sales volume discussed above improved segment operating profit by $7 million. Segment operating profit also benefited from $51 million in lower operating costs in 2016 than in the prior year due to energy deflation and improved operational performance. In 2015, production volumes were lower due to asset optimization projects that have now been completed. In addition, the region received an energy credit of approximately $10 million from a local government entity in 2016 that had been delayed for legislative reasons in 2015. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, especially the British pound, decreased segment operating profit by $14 million in 2016 compared to the prior year. Lower selling prices also decreased segment operating profit by $26 million.\nNorth America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2016 was $299 million compared with $265 million in 2015, an increase of $34 million, or 13%. Segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro food and beverage glass container distribution business in the region contributed $28 million of incremental profit in 2016. Higher selling prices as a result of contractual pass throughs increased segment operating profit by $25 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher production volumes and improved operating efficiencies were more than offset by cost inflation. Together, this contributed to a $13 million reduction to segment operating profit in 2016. The unfavorable sales mix discussed above reduced segment operating profit by $5 million. Also, the unfavorable effects of the weakening of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar decreased segment operating profit by $1 million.\nLatin America: Segment operating profit in Latin America in 2016 was $269 million compared with $183 million in 2015, an increase of $86 million, or 47%. Segment operating profit from the acquired Vitro food and beverage business contributed approximately $94 million of incremental profit to the region in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Vitro Acquisition, the decline in sales volume discussed above reduced segment operating profit by $13 million. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, especially the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and Mexican peso, decreased segment operating profit by $14 million in the current year.\nDespite management interventions to contain costs and improve asset optimization, segment operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by $57 million of higher operating costs, primarily due to energy and soda ash inflation in the region. Partially offsetting these declines were higher selling prices that increased segment operating profit by $71 million in 2016. In addition, approximately $5 million of gains related to non-strategic asset sales benefited 2016.\nAsia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2016 was $77 million compared with $83 million in 2015, a decrease of $6 million, or 7%. Cost inflation, higher production downtime due to furnace rebuild activity and higher costs for intra-regional shipments drove operating costs $21 million higher in 2016 compared to the prior year. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by $3 million in 2016. The more favorable sales mix discussed above improved segment operating profit by $3 million. Higher selling prices also increased segment operating profit by $9 million in the current year.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2016 was $272 million compared with $251 million in 2015. Net interest expense included $9 million and $42 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Exclusive of these items, net interest expense increased $54 million in the current year primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the Vitro Acquisition.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 was 33.4%, compared with 39.6% for 2015. The Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than 2015 due to the impact of significant costs related to refinancing, restructuring and acquisition-related costs in 2015 within jurisdictions that generated little or no tax benefit.\nExcluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company's effective tax rate for 2016 was approximately 24%, compared with approximately 25% for 2015.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016 was $21 million compared to $23 million for 2015. The decrease in 2016 was largely attributable to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company\nFor 2016, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $216 million, or $1.32 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $139 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted), for 2015. The after tax effects of the items excluded from segment operating profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2016 and 2015 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nGiven the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As described above, the Company's reported revenues and segment operating profit in 2016 were reduced due to foreign currency effects compared to 2015.\nThis trend has continued into 2017 as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and segment operating profit of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nItems Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals\nRetained Corporate Costs and Other\nRetained corporate costs and other for 2017 were $104 million compared with $98 million for 2016. These costs were higher in 2017 primarily due to lower equity earnings from the Company's joint-venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in the North America region. In prior years, equity earnings from this joint-venture were recorded in Retained Corporate Costs and Other as it was mostly in construction mode.\nRetained corporate costs and other for 2016 were $98 million compared with $70 million for 2015. These costs were higher in 2016 primarily due to pension expense, management incentive compensation expense and the impact from currency hedges.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded charges totaling $77 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $72 million of plant and furnace closures, primarily in the Latin America and Europe regions and other charges of $5 million.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges totaling $129 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $98 million of plant and furnace closures, primarily in the European and Latin America regions. In addition, other charges of $31 million were recorded during 2017, primarily related to an impairment charge recorded at one of the Company's equity investments.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges totaling $80 million for restructuring, asset impairment and other charges. These charges reflect $63 million of completed furnace closures, primarily in the North America and Latin America regions and other charges of $17 million.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPension Settlement Charges\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded charges totaling $218 million for pension settlements in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges totaling $98 million for pension settlements in the United States.\nSee Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCharge for Asbestos-Related Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no adjustment required for asbestos-related costs, compared to the charge of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the Company's comprehensive annual legal review of asbestos-related liabilities and costs. As part of its future comprehensive annual reviews, the Company will estimate its total asbestos-related liability and such reviews may result in adjustments to the liability accrued at the time of the review. The Company continues to believe that its ultimate asbestos-related liability cannot be estimated with certainty.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGain on China Land Compensation\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $71 million related to compensation received for land that the Company was required to return to the Chinese government.\nAcquisition-related Fair Value Adjustments and Strategic Transaction Costs\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges of $23 million for strategic transaction costs related to the Vitro Acquisition.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded charges of $22 million for acquisition-related fair value inventory adjustments related to the Vitro Acquisition. These charges were due to the accounting rules requiring inventory purchased in a business combination to be marked up to fair value and then recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold. During 2015, the Company also recorded charges of $10 million for acquisition-related fair value intangible asset adjustments related to trademark assets with short-term lives acquired as part of the Vitro Acquisition.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn April 4, 2016, the annulment committee formed by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID\u201d) ruled that OI European Group B.V. ( OIEG\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, is free to pursue the enforcement of a prior arbitration award (the Award\u201d) against Venezuela. As of December 31, 2017, that Award amounts to more than $500 million, including reimbursement of expenses and accrued\ninterest. Venezuela's application to annul the Award was heard by an ad hoc committee of the ICSID in September 2017, but no decision has been rendered yet.\nOn July 31, 2017, OIEG sold its right, title and interest in amounts due under the Award to an Ireland-domiciled investment fund. Under the terms of the sale, OIEG received a payment, in cash, at closing equal to $115 million (the Cash Payment\u201d). OIEG may also receive additional payments in the future ( Deferred Amounts\u201d) calculated based on the total compensation that is received from Venezuela as a result of collection efforts or as settlement of the Award with Venezuela. In the event that the Award is partially or completely annulled by the ICSID ad hoc annulment committee, OIEG may be required to repay to the purchaser up to the entire amount of the Cash Payment based on a formula tied to the amount of the Award (if any) that is annulled. In addition, OIEG's right to receive any Deferred Amounts is subject to the limitations described below.\nOIEG's interest in any amounts received in the future from Venezuela in respect of the Award is limited to a percentage of such recovery after taking into account reimbursement of the Cash Payment to the purchaser and reimbursement of legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company and the purchaser. OIEG's percentage of such recovery will also be reduced over time. Because the Award has yet to be satisfied, the annulment proceeding is pending, and the ability to successfully enforce the Award in countries that are party to the ICSID Convention is subject to significant challenges, the Company is unable to reasonably predict the amount of recoveries from the Award, if any, to which the Company may be entitled in the future. Any future amounts that the Company may receive from the Award are highly speculative and the timing of any such future payments, if any, is highly uncertain. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any future payments under the Award beyond the Cash Payment. Except as noted above in connection with the annulment proceeding that is pending before the ICSID ad hoc committee, the Cash Payment is not subject to any forfeiture or future adjustment.\nA separate arbitration involving other subsidiaries of the Company was initiated in 2012 to obtain compensation primarily for third-party minority shareholders' lost interests in the two expropriated plants. However, in November 2017, ICSID issued an award that dismissed this arbitration on jurisdiction grounds. The Company is currently exploring potential next steps.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company deferred the gain contingency on the sale of its rights in amounts due under the Award pending the ad hoc committee of the ICSID rendering its decision regarding Venezuela's application to annul the Award.\nThe loss from discontinued operations of $3 million and $7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to ongoing costs for the Venezuelan expropriation.\nVitro Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2015, the Company completed the Vitro Acquisition in a cash transaction valued at approximately $2.297 billion, subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments. The Vitro Business in Mexico is the largest supplier of glass containers in that country, manufacturing glass containers across multiple end uses, including food, soft drinks, beer, wine and spirits. The Vitro Acquisition included five food and beverage glass container plants in Mexico, a plant in Bolivia and a North American distribution business, and provided the Company with a competitive position in the glass packaging market in Mexico. The results of the Vitro Business have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since September 1, 2015. Vitro's food and beverage glass container operations in Mexico and Bolivia are included in the Latin American operating segment while its distribution business is included in the North American operating segment.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and total debt of $492 million and $5.3 billion, respectively, compared to $492 million and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. A significant\nportion of the cash was held in mature, liquid markets where the Company has operations, such as the U.S., Europe and Australia, and is readily available to fund global liquidity requirements. The amount of cash held in non-U.S. locations as of December 31, 2017 was $451 million.\nCurrent and Long-Term Debt\nOn April 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, which subsequently has been amended several times with the most recent amendment being entered into on September 28, 2017 (the Amended Agreement\u201d).\nAt December 31, 2017, the Amended Agreement includes a $300 million revolving credit facility, a $600 million multicurrency revolving credit facility and a $1,575 million term loan A facility ($1,148 million net of debt issuance costs), each of which has a final maturity date of April 22, 2020. At December 31, 2017, the Company had unused credit of $888 million available under the Amended Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Amended Agreement at December 31, 2017 was 3.17%.\nThe Amended Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, engage in certain affiliate transactions, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, and amend certain subordinated debt obligations.\nThe Amended Agreement also contains one financial covenant, a Total Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents ( Net Indebtedness\u201d), by consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Agreement. The Total Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing or acquisitions to the extent that such financing or acquisitions would cause the Total Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum of 4.0x for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter.\nOn September 28, 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 ( Amendment No. 5\u201d) to the Amended Agreement. Amendment No. 5 changes the calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio by excluding from the calculation of Net Indebtedness ordinary course revolver borrowings (except to the extent such borrowings existed at the prior year end) and non-recourse factoring or securitization debt.\nFailure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Amended Agreement. In such an event, the Company would be unable to request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Amended Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Amended Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Amended Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Amended Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Amended Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions.\nThe interest rates on borrowings under the Amended Agreement are, at the Company's option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loan A facility and the revolving credit facility is linked to the Company's Total Leverage Ratio and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum linked to the Total Leverage Ratio.\nBorrowings under the Amended Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets, excluding real estate and certain other excluded assets, of certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings are also secured by a pledge of intercompany debt and equity investments in certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and, in the case of foreign borrowings, of stock of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries. All borrowings under the Amended Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company.\nDuring November 2016, the Company issued senior notes with a face value of \u20ac500 million that bear interest at 3.125% and are due November 15, 2024 (the Senior Notes due 2024\u201d). The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $520 million and were used to repay the term loan B facility under the Amended Agreement. In March 2017, the Company expanded its borrowings under the Senior Notes due 2024 by issuing \u20ac225 million of additional notes that bear interest at 3.125% and are due November 15, 2024. The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $237 million and were used to repay a portion of the Company's revolving credit facility.\nDuring March 2017, the Company purchased in a tender offer approximately $228 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.80% Senior Debentures due in 2018. In November 2017, the remaining $22 million of the 7.80% Senior Debentures were repurchased by the Company, the indenture relating thereto was discharged, and all collateral and guarantees thereunder were released. The Company recorded $18 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the write-off of unamortized finance fees related to these actions.\nDuring December 2017, the Company issued senior notes with a face value of $310 million that bear interest at 4.000% and are due March 15, 2023. The notes were issued via a private placement and are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2018s domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $305 million and were used to repay a portion of the term loan A facility under the Amended Agreement.\nIn order to maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating-rate debt, the Company has entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe Company assesses its capital raising and refinancing needs on an ongoing basis and may enter into additional credit facilities and seek to issue equity and/or debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets if market conditions are favorable. Also, depending on market conditions, the Company may elect to repurchase portions of its debt securities in the open market.\nThe Company has a \u20ac185 million European accounts receivable securitization program, which extends through March 2019, subject to periodic renewal of backup credit lines.\nInformation related to the Company's accounts receivable securitization program as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nCash Flows\nOperating activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $724 million for 2017 compared to $758 million for 2016. The decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in working capital of $89 million compared to a decrease of $90 million in 2016. This increase in working capital in 2017 was primarily due to the nonreccurrence of a $128 million refund the Company received in 2016 on value added taxes previously paid in conjunction with an acquisition. Lower pension contributions and asbestos-related payments were more than offset by higher amounts of cash paid for restructuring activities in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nInvesting activities: Cash utilized in continuing investing activities was $466 million for 2017 compared to $417 million for 2016. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment during 2017 was $441 million, compared with $454 million in the prior year.\nAcquisition activities were $39 million and $56 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were primarily related to contributions made to the Company's joint venture with Constellation Brands in Nava, Mexico. In 2017, the Company received $14 million in net proceeds from the disposal of assets compared to $85 million in 2016. In 2016, these proceeds included the sale of land use rights in China that did not repeat in 2017. Also, in 2017, a subsidiary of the Company received $115 million from selling its right, title and interest in amounts due under a prior arbitration award against Venezuela related to a discontinued operation. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn October 2017, the Company signed an agreement to expand its joint venture with Constellation. To meet rising demand from Constellation's adjacent brewery, the newly-expanded relationship provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. This capacity expansion, which is estimated to cost approximately $140 million, will be financed by equal contributions from both partners throughout 2018 and 2019. The term of the joint venture agreement was also expanded for ten additional years, to 2034.\nFinancing activities: Cash utilized in financing activities was $392 million for 2017 compared to $228 million of cash utilized by financing activities for 2016. Financing activities in 2017 included additions to long-term debt of $1,458 million, which included the issuances of \u20ac225 million and $310 million of senior notes. Financing activities in 2017 also included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,764 million, which included the repayment of floating-rate debt in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility and the repurchase of the 2018 Senior Debentures. Financing activities in 2016 included additions to long-term debt of $1,235 million, which included the issuance of \u20ac500 million of senior notes. Financing activities in 2016 also included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,453 million, which included the repayment of floating-rate debt in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility. Borrowings under short-term loans decreased by $36 million in 2017. The Company paid approximately $28 million in note repurchase premiums and finance fees in 2017 compared to $9 million in 2016. The Company paid $17 million and $16 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn January 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a $400 million share repurchase program. The Company expects to repurchase approximately $100 million in shares of the Company's stock in 2018.\nThe Company anticipates that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Amended Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short-term (twelve months) and long-term basis. Based on the Company's expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Company's expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's liquidity on a short-term or long-term basis.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following information summarizes the Company's significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions).\n\n\n (1) Amounts based on rates and assumptions at December 31, 2017. \n (2) The Company's purchase obligations consist principally of contracted amounts for energy and molds. In cases where variable prices are involved, current market prices have been used. The amount above does not include ordinary course of business purchase orders because the majority of such purchase orders may be canceled. The Company does not believe such purchase orders will adversely affect its liquidity position. \n (3) In order to maintain minimum funding requirements, the Company is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $35 million in 2018. Future funding requirements for the Company's pension plans will depend largely on actual asset returns and future actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, and can vary significantly. \n (4) In 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Constellation Brands to operate a glass container plant in Nava, Mexico. To help meet current and rising demand from Constellation's adjacent brewery, the joint venture plans to expand the plant over the next two years. The Company expects to contribute approximately $70 million for the joint venture's expansion plans through 2019. \nThe Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for its unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nThe impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Company's reported and expected financial results.\nThe Company believes that accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation related to its asbestos liability, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment-The Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Company's business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a segment or a component of a segment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of PP&E based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nImpairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management's best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.\nGoodwill -Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). Step 1 compares the business enterprise value ( BEV\u201d) of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The BEV is computed based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third-party buyer. If the BEV is less than the carrying value for any reporting unit, then goodwill impairment must be calculated. Goodwill impairment will be calculated by comparing the reporting unit's fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. Any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value will be recorded as an impairment loss. The calculations of the BEV in Step 1 are based on significant unobservable inputs, such as projected future cash flows of the reporting units, discount rates, and terminal business value, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's projected future cash flows incorporates management's best estimates of the expected future results including, but not limited to, price trends, customer demand, material costs, asset replacement costs and any other known factors.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below the operating segment, also known as a component. Two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated into a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics, based on an assessment of various factors. The Company has determined that the Europe and North America segments are reporting units. The Company aggregated the components of the Latin America and Asia Pacific segments into single reporting units equal to the reportable segments. The aggregation of the components of these segments was based on their economic similarity as determined by the Company using a number of quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including gross margins, the manner in which the Company operates the business, the consistent nature of products, services, production processes, customers and methods of distribution, as well as the level of shared resources and assets between the components.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. Goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.6 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The Company has four reporting units of which three of the reporting units have goodwill and include; approximately $900 million of recorded goodwill to the Company's Europe segment, approximately $600 million of recorded goodwill to the Company's Latin America segment and approximately $1.1 billion of recorded goodwill to the Company's North America segment. The testing performed as of October 1, 2017, indicated a substantial excess of BEV over book value for Europe, North America and Latin America. If the Company's projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2017, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of these reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. Any impairment charges that the Company may take in the future could be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEV's would still have exceeded the book value of each of these reporting units.\nDuring the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at December 31, 2017, the Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting units may have been impaired and has determined that no such events have occurred. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2018 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2018, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth.\nOther Long-Lived Assets - Intangibles - Other long-lived assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships intangibles and are amortized using the accelerated amortization method over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an asset occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. The test for impairment would require the Company to make estimates about fair value, which may be determined based on discounted cash flows, third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of their assets.\nPension Benefit Plans\nSignificant Estimates-The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average discount rate was 3.69 % and 2.76 % for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively. The Company uses an expected long-term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans' assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans' assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short-term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long-term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2017, the Company's estimated weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 7.50% for U.S. plans and 6.32% for non-U.S. plans compared to 7.50% for U.S. plans and 7.15% for non-U.S. plans in 2016. The Company recorded pension expense from continuing operations (exclusive of settlement\ncharges) of $21 million, $23 million, and $24 million for the U.S. plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $8 million, $8 million, and $7 million for the non-U.S. plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $38 million of total pension expense for the full year of 2018. The 2018 pension expense will reflect a 7.25% and 5.52% expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. assets and non-U.S. assets, respectively.\nFuture effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one-half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities or in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a change of approximately $6 million and $11 million, respectively, in the pretax pension expense for the full year 2018.\nRecognition of Funded Status-The Company recognizes the funded status of each pension benefit plan on the balance sheet. The funded status of each plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income and the portion of each plan that exceeds 10% of the greater of that plan's assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees still accruing benefits or the expected life of participants not accruing benefits if all, or almost all, of the plan's participants are no longer accruing benefits.\nContingencies and Litigation Related to Asbestos Liability\nFor many years, the Company has conducted a comprehensive legal review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. As part of its current annual comprehensive legal review, the Company provides historical claims filing data to a third party consultant with expertise in predicting future claims filings based on actuarial inputs such as disease incidence and mortality. The Company uses these estimates of total future claims, along with its legal judgment regarding an estimation of future disposition costs and related legal costs, as inputs to develop a reasonable estimate of probable liability. If the results of the annual comprehensive legal review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is lower (higher) than its reasonably estimable asbestos-related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge (credit) to the Company's results of operations to increase (decrease) the accrued liability.\nThe significant assumptions underlying the material components of the Company's accrual are described in the Risk Factors section and in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these significant assumptions have the potential to impact the Company's asbestos-related liability.\nIn addition, if trends relating to the Company's actual claims filings materially differ, up or down, from the amounts predicted, the total number of estimated claims indicated by future actuarial analyses could change significantly. Significant changes in the total number of predicted claims could impact the total predicted asbestos-related liability, which in turn could result in a material charge or credit to the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company uses historical data for both indemnity and related legal costs, as well as its legal judgment and expectations about future inflationary and deflationary drivers, to predict the estimated disposition cost per claim and the legal costs for the remainder of the litigation. If trends relating to the actual per claim cost differ materially, up or down, from the previously estimated amount, the Company may in the future revise its estimate of its asbestos-related liability. The same may also be true with respect to legal costs. Significant changes in the estimated asbestos-related liability could result in a material charge or credit to the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss for its asbestos-related liabilities in excess of the amount currently recognized, which is $582 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company estimates that reasonably possible losses could result in asbestos-related liabilities up to $725 million. This estimate of additional reasonably possible loss reflects a qualitative legal judgment regarding the nature of contingencies that could impact future claims and legal costs, which include, but are not limited to, successful attempts by plaintiffs to challenge existing legal barriers to liability, enact plaintiff-oriented liability or damage-\nrelated legislation, establish new theories of liability, or revive long-dormant inventories of non-mesothelioma cases. However, it is also possible that the ultimate amount of asbestos-related liabilities could be above this estimate.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes as required by general accounting principles under which management judgment is required in determining income tax expense/(benefit) and the related balance sheet amounts. This judgment includes estimating and analyzing historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of taxable and tax deductible temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions. The Company has received tax assessments in excess of established reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company is contesting these tax assessments, and will continue to do so, including pursuing all available remedies such as appeals and litigation, if necessary.\nThe Company believes that adequate provisions for all income tax uncertainties have been made. However, if tax assessments are settled against the Company at amounts in excess of established reserves, it could have a material impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used for calculating income tax expense and potential differences in actual results from estimates could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and for tax attributes such as operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction on a separate or on a consolidated tax filing basis, as applicable, in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The Company considers the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n \u00b7 taxable income in prior carryback years; \n \u00b7 future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; \n \u00b7 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; and \n \u00b7 prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that the Company would be willing to undertake to prevent a deferred tax asset from otherwise expiring. \nThe assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or whether a change in judgment regarding the valuation allowance has occurred also considers all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to:\n \u00b7 nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative losses in recent years; \n \u00b7 duration of statutory carryforward and carryback periods; \n \u00b7 statutory limitations against utilization of tax attribute carryforwards against taxable income; \n \u00b7 historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and \n \u00b7 near and medium term financial outlook. \nThe weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in\nrecent years. The Company uses the actual results for the last two years and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.\nThe evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The recognition of deferred tax assets represents the Company's best estimate of those future events. Changes in the current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain tax jurisdictions, the Company's analysis indicates that it has cumulative losses in recent years. This is considered significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable and, therefore, difficult to overcome. However, the cumulative loss position is not solely determinative and, accordingly, the Company considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based on its analysis, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets where based on the weight of available evidence it is unlikely to realize those deferred tax assets.\nBased on the evidence available including a lack of sustainable earnings, the Company in its judgment previously recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its net deferred tax assets in the United States. If a change in judgment regarding this valuation allowance were to occur in the future, the Company will record a potentially material deferred tax benefit, which could result in a favorable impact on the effective tax rate in that period. The utilization of tax attributes to offset taxable income reduces the amount of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, allows filers to use prior year methodologies or estimates of the anticipated current impact of the Act in the preparation of their 2017 financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, it has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In all cases, the Company will continue to make and refine its calculations as additional data is gathered and further analysis is completed. In addition, the Company's estimates may also be affected as it gains a more thorough understanding of the tax law and certain aspects of the Act are clarified by the taxing authorities. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of tax expense (benefit) in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets was a net tax charge of $162 million, which was fully offset by an adjustment to valuation allowance. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $11 million for the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to an indefinite lived intangible asset. The Act did not change the Company's judgment regarding the realizability of these net deferred tax assets.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and for which no deferred taxes were recorded since the Company previously claimed the indefinite reinvestment assertion exception on these earnings. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability of $2 million, net of foreign tax credits. The Company has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P and associated foreign tax credits for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. The Company anticipates that additional guidance and clarification regarding the implementation\nof the transition tax will be issued by federal and state taxing authorities and this estimate is, therefore, subject to future refinement.\nNo additional income taxes (other than those related to the foreign earnings inclusion taxable under the transition tax) have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts provisionally continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company provisionally continues to apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the Act being enacted since the Company cannot complete its analysis of whether a change in its indefinite reinvestment assertion would occur until additional guidance is available and the transition tax liability computation is complete.\nThe Company has elected to treat Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) which is effective in 2018 for the Company as a period cost.\nAdditional guidance is likely to be issued providing further clarification on the application of the Act. Further, it is reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the U.S. legislation. This additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, could have a material adverse impact on net income and cash flow by impacting significant deductions or income inclusions.", "item_7_tables": "Table 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

primarily due to higher shipments, prices, and favorable foreign exchange rates. Segment operating profit also increased due to these factors.\n- Earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company were $183 million ($1.11 per share) in 2017, compared to $216 million ($1.32 per share) in 2016. Both years had certain charges that management considered non-representative of ongoing operations.\n\nSegment Performance\n- Sales and profits increased in Europe, Latin America and North America segments in 2017 but declined in Asia Pacific. Key drivers were higher volumes, prices, lower costs, and foreign exchange rates.\n\nCash Flows & Liquidity  \n- Operating cash flow was $724 million. Investing activities used $466 million, primarily for capital expenditures. Financing activities used $392 million, mainly for debt repayments.  \n- Debt totaled $5.3 billion. Credit facility was amended to improve terms. Various debt financing actions took place.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n- Impairment testing of goodwill and long-lived assets uses significant judgment and estimates. No impairment charges taken in 2017.\n- Pension expense calculation involves estimates of discount rates and asset returns. Costs were $29 million in 2017.\n- Asbestos liability accrual uses significant judgment and estimates. An annual comprehensive legal review is conducted.\n- Income taxes require estimates for asset valuation, outcome of uncertain positions, and impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."}
