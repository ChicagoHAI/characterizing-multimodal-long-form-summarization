MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nFirst Midwest Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Itasca, Illinois with operations throughout the Chicago metropolitan area as well as northwest Indiana, central and western Illinois, and eastern Iowa through 135 banking locations. Our principal subsidiary, First Midwest Bank, and other affiliates provide a broad range of commercial, retail, treasury management, and wealth management products and services to commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, municipal, and consumer customers. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of the people and businesses in the communities where we live and work by providing customized banking solutions, quality products, and innovative services that fulfill those financial needs.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three years ended December 31, 2017 and Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. When we use the terms \"First Midwest,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our,\" we mean First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term \"Bank,\" we are referring to our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, First Midwest Bank. Management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including interest rates, local and national economic conditions, business spending, consumer confidence, legislative and regulatory changes, certain seasonal factors, and changes in real estate and securities markets. Our management evaluates performance using a variety of qualitative and quantitative metrics. The primary quantitative metrics used by management include:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Interest Income - Net interest income, our primary source of revenue, equals the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Interest Margin - Net interest margin equals tax-equivalent net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Noninterest Income - Noninterest income is the income we earn from fee-based revenues, investment in bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") and other income, and non-operating revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Noninterest Expense - Noninterest expense is the expense we incur to operate the Company, which includes salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment, professional services, and other costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Asset Quality - Asset quality represents an estimation of the quality of our loan portfolio, including an assessment of the credit risk related to existing and potential loss exposure, and can be evaluated using a number of quantitative measures, such as non-performing loans to total loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulatory Capital - Our regulatory capital is classified in one of the following tiers: (i) Common Equity Tier 1 capital (\"CET1\"), which consists of common equity and retained earnings, less goodwill and other intangible assets and a portion of disallowed deferred tax assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital, which consists of CET1 and qualifying trust-preferred securities and the remaining portion of disallowed deferred tax assets, and (iii) Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses, subject to limitations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Some of these metrics may be presented on a non-GAAP basis. For detail on our non-GAAP measures, see the discussion in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" Unless otherwise stated, all earnings per common share data included in this section and throughout the remainder of this discussion are presented on a fully diluted basis.\nA quarterly summary of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is included in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Quarterly Earnings.\"\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank each had total assets of over $14.0 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies and banks with $10.0 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As a general matter, these requirements are phased-in and become applicable to the Company and the Bank over various dates. For a discussion of the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations have on the Company and the Bank now that they have each exceeded $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, see the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section in Item 1 \"Business\" and Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K may contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"probable,\" \"potential,\" \"possible,\" \"target,\" \"continue,\" \"look forward,\" or \"assume,\" and words of similar import. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead express only management's beliefs regarding future results or events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of management's control. It is possible that actual results and events may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results or events indicated in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes, and we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect new information or events or conditions after the date hereof.\nForward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial performance, the performance of our loan or securities portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves or charge-offs, corporate strategies or objectives, including the impact of strategic actions and initiatives, anticipated trends in our business, regulatory developments, the impact of federal income tax reform legislation, acquisition transactions, including estimated synergies, cost savings and financial benefits of consummated transactions, and growth strategies, including possible future acquisitions.

\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our subsequent filings made with the SEC. However, these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report describe additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nSIGNIFICANT RECENT EVENTS\nAcquisitions\nStandard Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 6, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Standard. With the acquisition, the Company acquired 35 banking offices located primarily in the southwest Chicago suburbs and adjacent markets in northwest Indiana, and added approximately $2.0 billion in deposits and $1.8 billion in loans. The merger consideration totaled $580.7 million and consisted of $533.6 million in Company common stock and $47.1 million in cash. All operating systems were converted during the first quarter of 2017.\nPremier Asset Management LLC\nOn February 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Premier, a registered investment advisor based in Chicago, Illinois. At the close of the acquisition, the Company acquired approximately $550.0 million of trust assets under management.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"federal income tax reform\") was enacted into law. This federal income tax reform, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\"), expanded investments in its colleagues and communities, and took certain actions related to its securities portfolio as follows:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revalued its DTAs by $27 million, which was recorded as additional income tax expense in the Company's statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased its minimum pay rate to $15 for hourly colleagues, effective in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Paid a special bonus of up to $1,035 to nearly 85% of colleagues. The aggregate amount of these bonuses was approximately $2 million on a pre-tax basis for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contributed approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation, which supports charitable organizations in the communities the Company serves.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidated all of its $46 million in trust-preferred collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\") at a minimal loss of approximately $800,000 late in the fourth quarter of 2017. This action improved the Company's total capital to risk-weighted assets by approximately 20 basis points.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sold $150 million of collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") and other mortgage-backed securities (\"MBSs\") late in the fourth quarter of 2017 at a loss of

Performance for 2017 and 2016 was impacted by certain significant transactions, which include: revaluation of DTAs related to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates (2017), a special bonus to colleagues (2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (both 2017 and 2016), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), and a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction (2016). Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share was $1.35 for 2017 and $1.22 for 2016. The increase in net income and earnings per share reflects the benefit of the Standard and Premier acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the full year impact of the NI Bancshares acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2016, organic loan growth, and increases in fee-based revenues, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.87% for 2017 compared to 3.60% for 2016, driven primarily by an increase in acquired loan accretion, higher rates, and the additional portfolio of higher-yielding fixed rate loans acquired in the Standard transaction, partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio and the continued shift of loan originations and mix to lower-yielding floating rate loans.\nTotal noninterest income was $163.1 million for 2017 compared to $159.3 million for 2016. Total fee-based revenues increased by 6.9% for 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to services provided to customers acquired in the Standard and Premier transactions and organic growth in wealth management and treasury management services, partly offset by lower card-based fees.\nTotal noninterest expense was $415.9 million for 2017, increasing by 22.5% compared to 2016. This increase is primarily the result of operating costs associated with the Standard and Premier transactions and compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nA detailed discussion of net interest income and noninterest income and expense is presented in the following section of this Item 7 titled \"Earnings Performance\" below.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, down 1.8%, from December 31, 2016. For a detailed discussion of our securities portfolio, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Investment Portfolio Management\" below.\nTotal loans of $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 reflects growth of $2.2 billion, or 26.5%, from December 31, 2016. This growth was driven primarily by loans acquired in the Standard transaction and sales production of the corporate and consumer lending teams.\nNon-performing assets represented 0.89% of total loans plus OREO as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.12% as of December 31, 2016 and 0.88% as of December 31, 2015.\nFor a detailed discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\" below.\nTotal average funding sources of $11.9 billion for 2017 increased by $2.3 billion from 2016, due primarily to the deposits assumed in the Standard acquisition. For a detailed discussion of our funding sources see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Funding and Liquidity Management\" below.\nPerformance Overview for 2016 Compared with 2015\nNet income for 2016 was $92.3 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to $82.1 million, or $1.05 per share, for 2015. Performance for 2016 and 2015 was impacted by certain significant transactions: acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (both 2016 and 2015), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction (2016), and property valuation adjustments related to strategic branch initiatives (2015). Excluding these certain significant transactions, earnings per share was $1.22 for 2016 and $1.13 for 2015. The increase in net income and earnings per share reflects the benefit of the Peoples acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the NI Bancshares acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2016, organic loan growth, and increases in fee-based revenues, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and provision for loan losses.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% for 2016 compared to 3.68% for 2015, driven primarily by organic growth in floating rate loans, lower acquired loan accretion, and the addition of FHLB advances, partially offset by the reinvestment of other interest-earning assets into higher-yielding securities.\nTotal noninterest income was $159.3 million for 2016 compared to $136.6 million for 2015. Total fee-based revenues increased by 14.0% for 2016 compared to 2015, driven mainly by services provided to customers added in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions and continued growth in mortgage banking and capital market products income.\nTotal noninterest expense was $339.5 million for 2016, increasing by 10.5% compared to 2015. Excluding certain significant transactions, total noninterest expense was $324.2 million for 2016, increasing by $27.0 million, or 9.1%, from 2015. This increase is primarily the result of operating costs associated with the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions and compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nAs of December 31, 2016 our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, rising $612.8 million, or 46.9%, from December 31, 2015. Growth for 2016 reflects purchases of certain securities and $125.8 million in securities acquired in the NI Bancshares acquisition.\nTotal loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 reflects growth of $1.1 billion, or 15.3%, from December 31, 2015. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales production of the corporate and consumer lending teams and the acquisition of NI Bancshares, which represents $279.7 million of loans at December 31, 2016.\nNon-performing assets represented 1.12% of total loans plus OREO as of December 31, 2016 compared to 0.88% as of December 31, 2015.\nTotal average funding sources of $9.5 billion for 2016 increased by $1.1 billion from 2015, due primarily to the deposits assumed in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions and the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances.\nEARNINGS PERFORMANCE\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue and is impacted by interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The accounting policies for the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are presented in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and net interest margin have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt loans and securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets. The effect of this adjustment is shown at the bottom of Table 2. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, they should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"\nTable 2 summarizes our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the related interest income and interest expense for each earning asset category and funding source, and the average interest rates earned and paid. Table 3 details differences in interest income and expense from prior years and the extent to which any changes are attributable to volume and rate fluctuations.\nTable 2\nNet Interest Income and

This increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of interest-earning assets and acquired loan accretion from the Standard transaction early in the first quarter of 2017, organic loan growth, and higher interest rates.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $33.9 million and $14.6 million to net interest income for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.87% for 2017, increasing by 27 basis points from 2016. The rise in tax-equivalent net interest margin was driven primarily by a 13 basis point increase in acquired loan accretion combined with the positive impact of higher interest rates. In addition, the impact of adding a portfolio of higher-yielding fixed-rate loans acquired from Standard contributed to the increase, partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio and the continued shift of loan originations and mix to lower-yielding floating rate loans.\nTotal average interest-earning assets were $12.4 billion for 2017, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 24.8%, from 2016. The increase resulted from interest-earning assets acquired in the Standard transaction, loan growth, and security purchases. In addition, interest-earning assets acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the increase.\nTotal average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.5 billion to $8.3 billion for 2017 from $6.8 billion for 2016. The increase resulted primarily from deposits acquired in the Standard transaction and the addition of FHLB advances during 2017. Deposits acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction also contributed to the increase.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTax-equivalent net interest income was $358.3 million for 2016 compared to $322.3 million for 2015, an increase of 11.2%. This increase was driven primarily by organic loan growth, the acquisition of interest-earning assets from the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 and the Peoples transaction late in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the redeployment of other interest-earning assets into securities, partially offset by higher borrowed funds costs from the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances during 2016.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $14.6 million and $16.3 million to net interest income for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% for 2016, decreasing 8 basis points from 2015. The decline was due primarily to organic growth in floating rate loans, lower acquired loan accretion, and the addition of FHLB advances, partially offset by the reinvestment of other interest-earning assets into higher-yielding securities.\nTotal average interest-earning assets were $10.0 billion for 2016, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 13.5%, from 2015, which reflects organic loan growth and security purchases, as well as $528.8 million of interest-earning assets acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction and $96.2 million of interest-earning assets acquired in the Peoples transaction.\nCompared to 2015, total average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $860.3 million, or 14.4%, during 2016. The increase resulted primarily from deposits acquired in the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions and the addition of FHLB advances during 2016.\nTable 3\nChanges in Net Interest Income Applicable

Excluding the negative $6.3 million impact to card-based fees due to the reduction in interchange revenue as the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (\"Durbin\") became effective in the second half of 2017, total fee-based revenues increased by 11.3% from 2016. Fee-based revenues were positively impacted by services provided to customers acquired in the Standard and Premier transactions completed in the first quarter of 2017 and organic growth in wealth management and treasury management services. Assets under management grew to $10.7 billion, a rise of $2.1 billion, or 24.1%, from 2016, driven primarily by organic growth and the addition of $863.4 million in trust assets under management from the Standard and Premier transactions, which contributed approximately $5.6 million to wealth management fees during 2017. In addition, the full year impact of customers acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the increase in fee-based revenues compared to 2016.\nThe decline in merchant servicing fees reflected lower customer volumes, offset by the decline in merchant card expense included in noninterest expense. The decline in capital market products income compared to 2016 was in-line with lower origination volumes compared to the same period.\nMortgage banking income during 2017 resulted from sales of $252.7 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market compared to sales of $283.3 million during 2016. In addition, mortgage banking income for 2017 was negatively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from year to year.\nBOLI income for 2017 was positively impacted by benefit settlements.\nNet securities losses of $1.9 million were recognized during 2017 in connection with gains from the strategic repositioning of the securities portfolio in the third quarter, which were more than offset by losses in the fourth quarter due to certain actions taken in light of federal income tax reform.\nDuring 2016, the Company completed a sale-leaseback transaction of 55 branches that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $88.0 million, net of transaction related expenses, of which $5.5 million was immediately recognized and the remaining $82.5 million was\ndeferred and will be accreted over future periods. Accretion related to the deferred gain was $5.9 million and $1.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in net occupancy and equipment expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal noninterest income was $159.3 million for 2016, increasing by 16.6% from 2015. Total fee-based revenues were $145.1 million, rising by 14.0% compared to 2015, reflecting growth across all categories. Approximately one-third of the increase in fee-based revenues was driven by services provided to customers acquired in the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions. In addition, card-based fees increased as a result of higher transaction volumes and capital market products income grew due to higher sales to commercial clients.\nThe increase in mortgage banking income during 2016 was due primarily to sales of $283.3 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market compared to sales of $180.0 million during 2015. In addition, mortgage banking income for 2016 was positively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from year to year.\nAssets under management grew to $8.6 billion, a rise of $1.2 billion, or 15.7%, from 2015, driven primarily by the addition of $700.0 million in trust assets under management from the NI Bancshares transaction, which contributed approximately $4.0 million to wealth management fees during 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nA summary of noninterest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2017 is presented in the following

Salaries and wages and advertising and promotions expense were impacted by the special bonus and charitable contribution in connection with federal income tax reform in 2017. In addition, both periods were impacted by acquisition and integration related expenses and 2016 was impacted by a lease cancellation fee as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation. Excluding these items, total noninterest expense increased to $392.3 million, up 21.0% compared to $324.2 million in 2016. Operating costs associated with the Standard and Premier transactions, which impacted most categories, drove the increase in total noninterest expense from 2016.\nThe increase in salaries and wages was also impacted by merit increases and investments in additional talent to support growth. Higher loan remediation expenses and certain costs associated with organizational growth contributed to the rise in professional services. Net OREO expense increased due to higher valuation adjustments and operating expenses, partially offset by net gains on sales of OREO properties.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal noninterest expense for 2016 increased by 10.5% compared to 2015. For both years, total noninterest expense was impacted by certain significant transactions: acquisition and integration related expenses (both 2016 and 2015), the lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), and property valuation adjustments related to strategic branch initiatives (2015). Excluding these adjustments, total noninterest expense was $324.2 million for 2016, increasing by $27.0 million, or 9.1%, from 2015. Operating costs associated with the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions drove the increase in total noninterest expense from 2015. These costs occurred primarily within salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expense, advertising and promotions, and other expenses. In addition, the increase in salaries and wages for 2016 was impacted by compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nNet OREO expense for 2016 decreased by 42.7% compared to 2015 due to reduced valuation adjustments and lower operating expenses, partially offset by net losses on sales of OREO properties realized during 2016.\nCompared to 2015, the increase in professional services and a portion of the rise in other expenses resulted from organizational growth needs for 2016. In addition, higher loan remediation expenses and vendor commissions related to the origination of equipment finance loans contributed to the increase in professional services from 2015.\nProperty valuation adjustments of $8.6 million were recognized during 2015 on twelve closed branches and seven parcels of land as part of the Company's strategic branch initiatives.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense.

For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Federal income tax expense and the related effective income tax rate are influenced by the amount of tax-exempt income derived from investment securities and BOLI in relation to pre-tax income as well as state income taxes. State income tax expense and the related effective income tax rate are driven by the amount of state tax-exempt income in relation to pre-tax income and state tax rules related to consolidated/combined reporting and sourcing of income and expense.\nFederal income tax reform was enacted on December 22, 2017. Among other things, the new law (i) establishes a new, flat corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21%, (ii) eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows the use of any such carryforwards to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, (iii) limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by U.S. corporations, (iv) allows businesses to immediately expense, for tax purposes, the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets, (v) eliminates or reduces certain deductions related to meals and entertainment expenses, (vi) modifies the\nlimitation on excessive employee remuneration to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation and clarifies the definition of a covered employee, and (vii) limits the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums. Federal income tax reform also significantly changes U.S. tax law related to foreign operations, however, such changes do not currently impact the Company.\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was impacted by the downward revaluation of DTAs by $26.6 million in the fourth quarter due to federal income tax reform as well as a $2.8 million benefit in the third quarter as a result of changes in Illinois income tax rates. Excluding these items, the Company's effective income tax rate was 35.0% for 2017 compared to 33.3% for 2016, up due to a rise in income subject to tax at statutory rates and increases in state statutory rates. The increases in income tax expense and the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 were due primarily to a rise in income subject to tax at statutory rates, partially offset by decreases in state statutory rates.\nOur accounting policies regarding the recognition of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Income are described in Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Portfolio Management\nSecurities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as securities held-to-maturity and are accounted for using historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Trading securities are carried at fair value and consist of securities held in a grantor trust for our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and are not considered part of the traditional investment portfolio. All other securities are classified as securities available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nWe manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, to meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income.\nFrom time to time, we adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio based on a number of factors, including expected loan growth, anticipated changes in collateralized public funds on account, the interest rate environment, and the related value of various segments of the securities markets.

securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, decreasing by $35.2 million, or 1.8%, from December 31, 2016, following a 46.9% increase from December 31, 2015. The decrease from December 31, 2016 was driven by securities sales of $629.8 million and $349.4 million of maturities, calls, and prepayments, partially offset by purchases of $733.4 million, consisting primarily of CMOs and MBSs. Purchase and sale activity during 2017 was driven primarily by the opportunistic repositioning of the securities portfolio in light of market conditions in the second half of the year as well as strategic actions in connection with federal income tax reform. The proceeds from sales of securities were reinvested in higher-yielding securities with similar durations. For additional detail regarding sales of securities, see the \"Realized Losses and Gains\" section of this Item 7 below.\nInvestments in municipal securities consist of general obligations of local municipalities in various states. Our municipal securities portfolio has historically experienced very low default rates and provides a predictable cash flow.\nThe following table presents the effective duration, average life, and yield to maturity for the Company's securities portfolio by category as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 8\nSecurities Effective Duration Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Duration (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Life (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Duration (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Life (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity (3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBSs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Held-to-Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M - Not meaningful.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The effective duration represents the estimated percentage change in the fair value of the securities portfolio given a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates.

The increase in average life and decrease in effective duration resulted from maturities and sales of securities that were reinvested in higher-yielding, lower-duration CMOs and MBSs.\nRealized Losses and Gains\nThere were $1.9 million of net securities losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 on securities with carrying values of $631.7 million. Net securities losses for 2017 were driven primarily by the opportunistic repositioning of the securities portfolio in light of market conditions in the second half of the year as well as strategic actions in connection with federal income tax reform, which included the liquidation of $47.7 million of CDOs. In addition, $214.1 million of securities were acquired in the Standard transaction during the first quarter of 2017, of which $210.2 million were sold shortly after the acquisition date and resulted in no gains or losses as they were recorded at fair value upon acquisition.\nNet securities gains of $1.4 million for 2016 resulted from the sale of municipal securities at gains of $1.1 million, and sales of MBSs and CMOs at net gains of $304,000.\nNet securities gains of $2.4 million for 2015 resulted from the sale of MBSs at gains of $1.9 million, and sales of CMOs, municipal securities, and other investments at net gains of $521,000.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nUnrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio. These amounts are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss on an after-tax basis. This balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change and affect the aggregate fair value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, net unrealized losses totaled $23.6 million compared to net unrealized losses of $38.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease is due primarily to the sale of CDOs in 2017, which had unrealized losses of $14.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nNet unrealized losses in the CMO portfolio totaled $17.8 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $16.7 million as of December 31, 2016. CMOs are either backed by U.S. government-owned agencies or issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. We do not believe any individual unrealized loss on these securities as of December 31, 2017 represents OTTI related to credit deterioration. In addition, we do not intend to sell the CMOs with unrealized losses and we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. For additional discussion of unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, see Note 4 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 9\nRepricing Distribution and Portfolio Yields\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Five Years to Ten Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMOs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>812,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBSs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available-for-sale\nsecurities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,367,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Held-to-Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M -

The accounting policies for the recording of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the recognition and/or deferral of interest income and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income are included in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur loan portfolio is comprised of both corporate and consumer loans with corporate loans representing 81.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. Consistent with our emphasis on relationship banking, the majority of our corporate loans are made to our core, multi-relationship customers. The customers usually maintain deposit relationships and utilize our other banking services, such as treasury or wealth management services.\nTo maximize loan income with an acceptable level of risk, we have certain lending policies and procedures that management reviews on a regular basis. In addition, management receives periodic reporting related to loan production, loan quality, credit concentrations, loan delinquencies, and non-performing and corporate performing potential problem loans to monitor and mitigate potential and current risks in the portfolio.\nTable 10\nLoan Portfolio\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Table 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

of December 31, 2017 reflect growth of $2.2 billion, or 26.5%, from December 31, 2016. Excluding loans related to customers and locations acquired in the Standard transaction, total loans grew by approximately 7% from December 31, 2016. Growth in commercial and industrial loans, primarily within our sector-based lending businesses and multi-family loans, contributed to the increase in total corporate loans. Total loans were also impacted by the addition of 1-4 family mortgages, installment loans, and shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 reflect growth of $1.1 billion, or 15.3%, from December 31, 2015 including loans acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction of $279.7 million, or 11.3%, excluding these acquired loans. Growth in commercial and industrial loans resulted primarily from broad-based increases within our middle market and sector-based lending business units. Office, retail, and industrial and multi-family loans increased compared to December 31, 2015 due to organic growth. The rise in construction loans compared to the same period was driven primarily by select commercial projects for which permanent\nfinancing is expected upon their completion. The rise in consumer loans compared to December 31, 2015 resulted from the continued expansion of mortgage and installment loans and the addition of shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans.\nComparisons of Prior Years (2015, 2014, and 2013)\nTotal loans of $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 reflect growth of $424.9 million, or 6.3%, from December 31, 2014. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales production of the corporate lending teams and growth in consumer loans. In addition, the Peoples acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 contributed $53.9 million in loans. Growth in corporate loans was concentrated within our commercial and industrial loan category, reflective of the continued expansion into sector-based lending areas. The overall decline in commercial real estate loans from December 31, 2014 resulted from the decision of certain customers to opportunistically sell their commercial businesses and investment real estate properties or use excess liquidity to payoff long-term debt. These decreases more than offset organic commercial real estate growth. Consumer loans totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and increased $227.9 million, or 24.0%, from December 31, 2014. This growth reflects the addition of shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans, and growth in 1-4 family mortgages.\nTotal loans of $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 reflected growth of $1.0 billion, or 17.9%, from December 31, 2013. Excluding loans acquired in the Popular and Great Lakes transactions of $718.3 million, total loans grew $304.2 million from December 31, 2013. Solid performance from our legacy sales platform concentrated within our commercial and industrial, agricultural, and multi-family loan categories reflected the continued impact of greater resource investments and expansion into sector-based lending areas. Excluding loans acquired in the Popular and Great Lakes transactions of $93.5 million, consumer loans increased $60.0 million, or 7.5%, which reflects the addition of shorter-duration home equity loans.\nCommercial, Industrial, and Agricultural Loans\nCommercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represent 37.9% of total loans, and totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $743.6 million, or 23.1%, from December 31, 2016. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans generally located in the Chicago metropolitan area with purposes that include supporting seasonal working capital needs, accounts receivable financing, inventory and equipment financing, and select sector-based lending, such as healthcare, asset-based lending, structured finance, and syndications. Our commercial and industrial portfolio does not have significant direct exposure to the oil and gas industry. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory. The underlying collateral securing commercial and industrial loans may fluctuate in value due to the success of the business or economic conditions. For loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for repayment and economic conditions may impact the cash flow of the borrower. Accordingly, the underwriting for these loans is based primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower and may incorporate a personal guarantee.\nAgricultural loans are generally provided to meet seasonal production, equipment, and farm real estate borrowing needs of individual and corporate crop and livestock producers. Seasonal crop production loans are repaid by the liquidation of the financed crop that is typically covered by crop insurance. Equipment and real estate term loans are repaid through cash flows of the farming operation. Risks uniquely inherent in agricultural loans relate to weather conditions, agricultural product pricing, and loss of crops or livestock due to disease or other factors. Therefore, as part of the underwriting process, the Company examines projected future cash flows, financial statement stability, and the value of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. The repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. This category of loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market. In addition, many commercial real estate loans do not fully amortize over the term of the loan, but have balloon payments due at maturity. The borrower's ability to make a balloon payment may depend on the availability of long-term financing or their ability to complete a timely sale of the underlying property. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography, and risk rating criteria.\nConstruction loans are generally made based on estimates of costs and values associated with the completed projects and are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analyses of absorption and lease rates, and financial analyses of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment may be permanent long-term financing, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment until permanent financing is obtained. Generally, construction loans have a higher risk profile than other real estate loans since repayment is impacted by real estate values, interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, demand and supply of alternative real estate, the availability of long-term financing, and changes in general economic conditions.\nThe following table provides commercial real estate loan

of properties securing the loans in our commercial real estate portfolio is balanced between owner-occupied and investor categories and is diverse in terms of type and geographic location, generally within the Company's markets. Approximately 43% of the commercial real estate portfolio, excluding multi-family and construction loans, is owner-occupied as of December 31, 2017. Using outstanding loan balances, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total capital was 213% and construction loans to total capital was 28% as of December 31, 2017. Non-owner-occupied (investor) commercial real estate is calculated in accordance with federal banking agency guidelines and includes construction, multi-family, non-farm non-residential property, and commercial real estate loans that are not secured by real estate collateral.\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer loans represent 18.4% of total loans, and totaled $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $513.5 million, or 36.4%, from December 31, 2016. Consumer loans are centrally underwritten using a credit scoring model developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\"), which employs a risk-based system to determine the probability that a borrower may default. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include loan-to-value and affordability ratios, risk-based pricing strategies, and documentation requirements. The home equity category consists mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by junior liens on owner-occupied real estate. Loan-to-value ratios on home equity loans and 1-4 family mortgages are based on the current appraised value of the collateral. Repayment for these loans is dependent on the borrower's continued financial stability, and is more likely to be impacted by adverse personal circumstances.\nMaturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Corporate Loans\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of our corporate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, For additional discussion of interest rate sensitivity, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Form 10-K.\nTable 12\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Corporate Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Table 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Due In\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than One to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, industrial, and agricultural\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,716,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>752,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,960,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,041,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,737,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>774,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,553,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total corporate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,454,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,527,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,514,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans by interest rate type:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,097,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,898,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,334,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floating interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,435,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,555,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,188,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,179,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total corporate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,454,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,527,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,514,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the composition of our corporate loans between fixed and floating interest rates was 39% and 61%, respectively.

respectively. Included in non-performing assets as of December 31, 2017 was $5.3 million of OREO acquired in the Standard transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2016, non-performing assets increased by $29.7 million, or 47.1%, from December 31, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of five corporate loan relationships to non-accrual status during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2015, non-performing assets decreased by $48.0 million, or 43.2%, from December 31, 2014, due mainly to lower levels of non-accrual loans. The improvement in non-accrual loans related primarily to the final resolution of a large commercial loan relationship originally identified in the second half of 2014, for which a specific reserve was then established. In addition, lower levels of covered non-performing assets contributed to the decrease.\nNon-performing assets decreased by $56.6 million, or 33.8%, from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by the return of three TDRs totaling $20.7 million to performing status, sales of OREO properties, and a decline in 90 days or more past due loans.\nTDRs\nLoan modifications may be performed at the request of an individual borrower and may include reductions in interest rates, changes in payments, and extensions of maturity dates. We occasionally restructure loans at other than market rates or terms to enable the borrower to work through financial difficulties for a period of time, and these restructured loans remain classified as TDRs for the remaining terms of the loans. A discussion of our accounting policies for TDRs can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 15\nTDRs by Type\n(Dollar amounts in

The increase was driven primarily by the extension of two non-accrual credits during 2017. The December 31, 2017 total includes $1.8 million in loans that are accruing interest, with the majority restructured at market terms. After a sufficient period of performance under the modified terms, the loans restructured at market rates will be reclassified to performing status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, TDRs totaled $8.6 million, increasing by $3.5 million from December 31, 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the addition of two corporate loan relationships to non-accrual TDR status.\nCorporate Performing Potential Problem Loans\nCorporate performing potential problem loans consist of special mention loans and substandard loans, excluding accruing TDRs. These loans are performing in accordance with their contractual terms, but we have concerns about the ability of the borrower to continue to comply with loan terms due to the borrower's operating or

Determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of current economic trends.\nAcquired loans are recorded at fair value, which incorporates credit risk, at the date of acquisition. No allowance for credit losses is recorded on the acquisition date for such loans. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. In addition, certain acquired loans that have renewed subsequent to their respective acquisition dates are no longer classified as acquired loans. Instead, they are included with our loan population that is allocated an allowance in accordance with our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nWhile management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for credit losses depends on a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, including the performance of its loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and property values, and the interpretation of loan risk ratings by regulatory authorities. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is an appropriate estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nThe accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAn allowance for credit losses is established on loans originated by the Bank, acquired loans, and covered loans. Additional discussion regarding acquired and covered loans can be found in Notes 1 and 6 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table provides additional details related to acquired loans, the allowance for credit losses as related to acquired loans, and the remaining acquisition adjustment associated with acquired loans as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 19\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Acquisition Adjustment\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loans, Excluding Acquired Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquired Loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,644\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,822,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,615,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,437,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses to total loans (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment to acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,620,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,254,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses to total loans (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment to acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A -

The acquisition adjustment increased by $52.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the Standard transaction. This was partially offset by acquired loan accretion, resulting in a remaining acquisition adjustment as a percent of acquired loans of 4.62% as of December 31, 2017. Acquired loans that are renewed are no longer classified as acquired loans. These loans totaled $366.0 million and $117.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in loans, excluding acquired loans, in the table above and allocated an allowance in accordance with our allowance for loan losses methodology. In addition, there is an allowance for credit losses of $2.6 million on acquired loans.\nTable 20\nAllowance for Credit Losses and\nSummary of Credit Loss Experience\n(Dollar amounts in

INSURANCE\nWe previously purchased life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors and officers and are the sole owner and beneficiary of the policies. We invested in these BOLI policies to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefit costs. Therefore, our BOLI policies are intended to be long-term investments to provide funding for long-term liabilities. We record these BOLI policies as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at each policy's respective cash surrender value (\"CSV\") with changes recorded as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2017, the CSV of BOLI assets totaled $279.9 million. Income and proceeds for BOLI policies are not subject to income taxation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 50.1% of our total BOLI portfolio is invested in general account life insurance distributed among fifteen insurance carriers, all of which carry investment grade ratings. This general account life insurance typically includes a feature guaranteeing minimum returns. The remaining 49.9% is in separate account life insurance, which is managed by third-party investment advisors under pre-determined investment guidelines. Stable value protection is a feature available for separate account life insurance policies that is designed to protect a policy's CSV from market fluctuations, within limits, on underlying investments. Our entire separate account portfolio has stable value protection purchased from a highly rated financial institution. To the extent fair values on individual contracts fall below 80% of their CSV, the CSV of the specific contracts may be reduced or the underlying assets may be transferred to short-duration investments, resulting in lower earnings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had BOLI income of $5.9 million compared to prior year BOLI income of $3.6 million.\nGOODWILL\nThe carrying amount of goodwill was $697.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and $340.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Goodwill increased by $356.7 million from December 31, 2016, which consisted of $345.3 million related to the Standard acquisition, $11.0 million related to the Premier acquisition, and a $423,000 measurement period adjustment related to finalizing the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the NI Bancshares acquisition. For additional detail regarding goodwill, see Note 9 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate a need to perform interim tests, as described in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2017, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill at October 1, 2017 and determined that goodwill was not impaired at that date and there was no indication that goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income tax expense recorded due to changes in uncertain tax positions is also described in Note 15.\nTable 22\nDeferred Tax Assets\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net DTAs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement assessed whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the DTAs will not be realized. This assessment considered whether, in the periods of reversal, the DTAs can be realized through carryback to income in prior years, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, and future taxable income, including taxable income resulting from the application of future tax planning strategies. The assessment also considered positive and negative evidence, including pre-tax income during the current and prior two years, actual performance compared to budget, trends in non-performing assets and corporate performing potential problem loans, the Company's capital position, and any unsettled circumstances that could impact future earnings. Based on this assessment, management determined that it is more likely than not that our DTAs will be fully realized and no valuation allowance is required as of December 31, 2017.\nNet DTAs decreased in 2017 due primarily to the downward revaluation of DTAs by $26.6 million related to federal income tax reform, partly offset by a $2.8 million benefit due to changes in the Illinois income tax rates. In addition, accelerated tax gains associated with the disposition of assets resulting from the sale-leaseback transaction and securities valuation adjustments, partially offset by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards contributed to the decrease. Net DTAs increased in 2016 due primarily to accelerated tax gains associated with the disposition of assets resulting from the sale-leaseback transaction and securities valuation adjustments, partially offset by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nFUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flows as they become due. Our approach to liquidity management is to obtain funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit, withdrawal, and loan demand needs. Our liquidity policy establishes parameters to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a 12-month forward-looking period, including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the Bank's Board of Directors. The compliance plan includes an analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds and incorporates a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly. Based on these assumptions, we determine our total cash liquidity on hand and excess collateral capacity from pledging, unused federal funds purchased lines, and other unused borrowing capacity, such as FHLB advances, resulting in a calculation of our total liquidity capacity. Our total policy-directed liquidity requirement is to have funding sources available to cover 50.0% of non-collateralized, non-FDIC insured, non-maturity deposits. Based on our projections as of December 31, 2017, we expect to have liquidity capacity in excess of policy guidelines for the forward twelve-month period.\nThe liquidity needs of First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis (the \"Parent Company\") consist primarily of operating expenses, debt service payments, and dividend payments to our stockholders, which totaled $82.6 million for the year\nended December 31, 2017. The primary source of liquidity for the Parent Company is dividends from subsidiaries. The Parent Company had $48.2 million in junior subordinated debentures, $146.9 million in subordinated notes, and cash and interest-bearing deposits of $120.8 million as of December 31, 2017. On September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association providing for a $50.0 million short-term, unsecured revolving credit facility. On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into a first amendment to this credit facility, which extends the maturity to September 26, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding under the facility. The Parent Company has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt.\nTotal deposits and borrowed funds as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in Notes 10 and 11 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table provides a comparison of average funding sources over the last three years. We believe that average balances, rather than period-end balances, are more meaningful in analyzing funding sources because of the normal fluctuations that may occur on a daily or monthly basis within funding categories.\nTable 23\nFunding Sources - Average Balances\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nAverage borrowed funds totaled $622.1 million, $497.6 million, and $151.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 from 2016 and in 2016 from 2015 was due primarily to higher levels of FHLB advances. The weighted-average rate on FHLB advances for the year-to-date periods was impacted by the hedging of $415.0 million and $325.0 million of FHLB advances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, using interest rate swaps through which the Company receives variable amounts and pays fixed amounts. The weighted-average interest rate paid on these interest rate swaps was 2.17% and 2.19% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For further discussion of interest rate swaps, see Note 19 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association providing for a $50.0 million short-term, unsecured revolving credit facility. On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into a first amendment to this credit facility, which extends the maturity to September 26, 2018. Advances will bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, adjusted on a monthly basis, and the Company must pay an unused facility fee equal to 0.35% per annum on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding under the facility.\nWe make interchangeable use of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, and federal funds purchased to supplement deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within 1 to 90 days from the transaction date.\nSenior and Subordinated Debt\nAverage senior and subordinated debt decreased by $2.6 million, or 1.3%, from 2016 to 2017 and $3.5 million, or 1.8%, from 2015 to 2016. These decreases resulted from the timing of the maturity and repayment of $38.5 million of 5.850% subordinated notes on April 1, 2016 and $115.0 million of the Company's 5.875% senior notes on November 22, 2016, which were partly offset by the issuance and sale of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% subordinated notes due 2026, issued on September 29, 2016. See Note 12 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding these transactions.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThrough our normal course of operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. These obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for our loans.\nThe following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as of December 31, 2017. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 26\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Risk, and Contingent Liabilities\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due In\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Note\nReference\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than One to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposits (no stated maturity)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,406,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,406,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,086,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,646,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,866,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M - Not meaningful.\nMANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL\nCapital Measurements\nA strong capital structure is required under applicable banking regulations and is crucial in maintaining investor confidence, accessing capital markets, and enabling us to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Our capital policy requires that the Company and the Bank maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines. It serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities and sets targeted levels of return on equity. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies. On January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital rules, a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations published by the Federal Reserve. These rules are discussed in the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section in Item 1, \"Business\" of this Form 10-K. In addition, financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital. The Company submitted its first required stress test report for the July 31, 2017 reporting date and the Bank will become subject to these stress test requirements starting with the July 31, 2018 reporting date.\nThe following table presents our consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the Federal Reserve for the Bank to be categorized as \"well-capitalized.\" We manage our capital ratios for both the Company and the Bank to consistently maintain these measurements in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum levels to be considered \"well-capitalized,\" which is the highest capital category established. All regulatory mandated ratios for characterization as \"well-capitalized\" were exceeded as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nThe tangible common equity ratios presented in the table below are capital adequacy metrics used and relied on by investors and industry analysts; however, they are non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"\nTable 27\nCapital Measurements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory\nMinimum For\nWell-\nCapitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Excess Over\nRequired Minimums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank regulatory capital ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CET1 to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital to average assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>542,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company regulatory capital ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CET1 to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital to average assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company tangible common equity ratios (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity to tangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity, excluding accumulated\nother comprehensive income, to tangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A - Not applicable.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Ratios are not subject to formal Federal Reserve regulatory guidance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Tangible common equity ratios are non-GAAP financial measures.

These increases were partially offset by the impact of the Standard and Premier acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Board reviews the Company's capital plan each quarter, considering the current and expected operating environment as well as evaluating various capital alternatives. For further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 for the Company and the Bank, see Note 18 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nThe Company maintains a Board-approved stock repurchase program by which shares of Company common stock may be repurchased. Shares repurchased, whether as part of or outside of the Board-approved program, are held as treasury stock and are available for issuance in connection with our qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, share-based compensation plans, and other general corporate purposes. We reissued 133,907 treasury shares in 2017 and 119,823 treasury shares in 2016 pursuant to these plans.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and for each of the quarters through the first quarter of 2017. The Company increased the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share for each of the quarters from the second quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 represents the 140th consecutive cash dividend paid by the Company since its inception in 1983.\nQUARTERLY EARNINGS\nTable 28\nQuarterly Earnings

Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share was $0.34, $0.33, $0.35, and $0.34 for the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of 2017, respectively, compared to $0.32 for each of the fourth, third, and second quarters of 2016 and $0.27 for the first quarter of 2016.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and are consistent with general practices within the banking industry. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on the best available information as of the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations. Future changes in information may impact these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which may have a material effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.\nThe most significant of our accounting policies and estimates are presented in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, these policies provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates, assumptions, and judgments underlying those amounts, management determined that our accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, valuation of securities, income taxes, and goodwill and other intangible assets are considered to be our critical accounting estimates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans, actual loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, and other factors, all of which are susceptible to significant change. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are established through the provision for loan losses charged to expense. The amount charged to operating expense depends on a number of factors, including historic loan growth, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-off levels, and our assessment of the allowance for loan losses. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, see Notes 1 and 7 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nValuation of Securities\nThe fair values of securities are based on quoted prices obtained from third-party pricing services or dealer market participants where a ready market for such securities exists. In the absence of quoted prices or where a market for the security does not exist, management judgment and estimation is used, which may include modeling-based techniques. The use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair value of securities could result in a different fair value estimate.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess securities with unrealized losses to determine whether OTTI has occurred. In evaluating OTTI, management considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including external credit ratings and recent downgrades for debt securities, intent to hold the security until its value recovers, and the likelihood that the Company would be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value, which may be at maturity. The term \"other-than-temporary\" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent. It indicates that the prospects for near-term recovery are not necessarily favorable or there is a lack of evidence to support fair values greater than or equal to the carrying value of the investment. Securities for which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss and included in net securities (losses) gains, but only to the extent the impairment is related to credit deterioration. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) unless management intends to sell the security in a short period of time or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to full recovery. The determination of OTTI is subjective and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing and amount of loss realization. For additional discussion of securities, see Notes 1 and 4 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences result in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nWe assess the likelihood that any DTAs will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management makes judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning\nstrategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that DTAs included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nManagement also makes certain interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of the tax position may not be certain. Uncertain tax positions are periodically evaluated and we may establish tax reserves for benefits that may not be realized. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, both intangible and tangible, be recorded at their estimated fair value upon acquisition. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized, instead, we assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nOther intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance, but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. The determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For additional discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 1 and 9 of \"Notes to the Consolidated financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RECONCILIATIONS\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, adjusted, tax-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), tax-equivalent net interest margin, tax-equivalent net interest margin, adjusted, effective income tax rate, excluding revaluations of DTAs, return on average common equity, adjusted, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), to tangible assets, tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, adjusted.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, all adjusted for certain significant transactions. These transaction include the revaluation of DTAs (fourth and third quarters of 2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (fourth quarter and third quarters of 2017), a special bonus to colleagues (fourth quarter of 2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (fourth quarter of 2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (all periods presented, excluding the fourth quarter of 2017), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (fourth quarter of 2016), a net gain on sale-leaseback transaction (third quarter of 2016), property valuation adjustments (2015), a gain on the sale of an equity investment (2013), losses on early extinguishment of debt (2013), gain on the termination of FHLB commitments (2013), adjusted amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset (2013), and a BOLI modification loss (2013). Management believes excluding these transactions from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity is useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these transactions do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion facilitates better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding acquisition and integration related expenses from these metrics is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and assumes a 35% tax rate. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. In addition, management believes that presenting tax-equivalent net interest margin, excluding the impact of acquired loan accretion, enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes and is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since acquired loan accretion income may fluctuate based on the size of each acquisition, as well as from period to period.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nThe Company presents the allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans. Management believes excluding acquired loans is useful as it facilitates better comparability between periods as these loans are recorded at fair value, which incorporates credit risk, at the date of acquisition. No allowance for credit losses is recorded on the acquisition date. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. See Table 20 in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\" for details on the calculation of this measure.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. See the following reconciliations for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nTable 181:

Management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including interest rates, local and national economic conditions, business spending, consumer confidence, legislative and regulatory changes, certain seasonal factors, and changes in real estate and securities markets. Our management evaluates performance using a variety of qualitative and quantitative metrics. The primary quantitative metrics used by management include:\n \u2022 Net Interest Income - Net interest income, our primary source of revenue, equals the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \n \u2022 Net Interest Margin - Net interest margin equals tax-equivalent net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets. \n \u2022 Noninterest Income - Noninterest income is the income we earn from fee-based revenues, investment in bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") and other income, and non-operating revenues. \n \u2022 Noninterest Expense - Noninterest expense is the expense we incur to operate the Company, which includes salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment, professional services, and other costs. \n \u2022 Asset Quality - Asset quality represents an estimation of the quality of our loan portfolio, including an assessment of the credit risk related to existing and potential loss exposure, and can be evaluated using a number of quantitative measures, such as non-performing loans to total loans. \n \u2022 Regulatory Capital - Our regulatory capital is classified in one of the following tiers: (i) Common Equity Tier 1 capital (\"CET1\"), which consists of common equity and retained earnings, less goodwill and other intangible assets and a portion of disallowed deferred tax assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital, which consists of CET1 and qualifying trust-preferred securities and the remaining portion of disallowed deferred tax assets, and (iii) Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses, subject to limitations.  Some of these metrics may be presented on a non-GAAP basis. For detail on our non-GAAP measures, see the discussion in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" Unless otherwise stated, all earnings per common share data included in this section and throughout the remainder of this discussion are presented on a fully diluted basis.\nA quarterly summary of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is included in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Quarterly Earnings.\"\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank each had total assets of over $14.0 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies and banks with $10.0 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As a general matter, these requirements are phased-in and become applicable to the Company and the Bank over various dates. For a discussion of the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations have on the Company and the Bank now that they have each exceeded $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, see the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section in Item 1 \"Business\" and Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K may contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"probable,\" \"potential,\" \"possible,\" \"target,\" \"continue,\" \"look forward,\" or \"assume,\" and words of similar import. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead express only management's beliefs regarding future results or events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of management's control. It is possible that actual results and events may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results or events indicated in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes, and we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect new information or events or conditions after the date hereof.\nForward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial performance, the performance of our loan or securities portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves or charge-offs, corporate strategies or objectives, including the impact of strategic actions and initiatives, anticipated trends in our business, regulatory developments, the impact of federal income tax reform legislation, acquisition transactions, including estimated synergies, cost savings and financial benefits of consummated transactions, and growth strategies, including possible future acquisitions. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. These risks, uncertainties, and assumptions include, among other things, the following:\n \u2022 Management's ability to reduce and effectively manage interest rate risk and the impact of interest rates in general on the volatility of our net interest income. \n \u2022 Asset and liability matching risks and liquidity risks. \n \u2022 Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities. \n \u2022 The ability to attract and retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services. \n \u2022 The sufficiency of the allowance for credit losses to absorb the amount of actual losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The models and assumptions underlying the establishment of the allowance for credit losses and estimation of values of collateral and various financial assets and liabilities may be inadequate. \n \u2022 Credit risks and risks from concentrations (by geographic area and by industry) within our loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds, and other financial institutions operating in our markets or elsewhere providing similar services. \n \u2022 Changes in the economic environment, competition, or other factors that may influence the anticipated growth rate of loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio, and loan and deposit pricing. \n \u2022 Changes in general economic or industry conditions, nationally or in the communities in which we conduct business. \n \u2022 Volatility of rate sensitive deposits. \n \u2022 Our ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to compete effectively in the marketplace. \n \u2022 Operational risks, including data processing system failures, fraud, or breaches. \n \u2022 Our ability to successfully pursue acquisition and expansion strategies and integrate any acquired companies. \n \u2022 The impact of liabilities arising from legal or administrative proceedings, enforcement of bank regulations, and enactment or application of laws or regulations. \n \u2022 Governmental monetary and fiscal policies and legislative and regulatory changes (including those implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act) that may result in the imposition of costs and constraints through higher FDIC insurance premiums, significant fluctuations in market interest rates, increases in capital or liquidity requirements, operational limitations, or compliance costs. \n \u2022 Changes in federal and state tax laws or interpretations, including changes affecting tax rates, income not subject to tax under existing law and interpretations, income sourcing, or consolidation/combination rules. \n \u2022 Changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines affecting the businesses we conduct. \n \u2022 Acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, and other external events. \n \u2022 Other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, products, services, and prices. \nFor a further discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should refer to the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A in this report, this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our subsequent filings made with the SEC. However, these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report describe additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nSIGNIFICANT RECENT EVENTS\nAcquisitions\nStandard Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 6, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Standard. With the acquisition, the Company acquired 35 banking offices located primarily in the southwest Chicago suburbs and adjacent markets in northwest Indiana, and added approximately $2.0 billion in deposits and $1.8 billion in loans. The merger consideration totaled $580.7 million and consisted of $533.6 million in Company common stock and $47.1 million in cash. All operating systems were converted during the first quarter of 2017.\nPremier Asset Management LLC\nOn February 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Premier, a registered investment advisor based in Chicago, Illinois. At the close of the acquisition, the Company acquired approximately $550.0 million of trust assets under management.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"federal income tax reform\") was enacted into law. This federal income tax reform, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\"), expanded investments in its colleagues and communities, and took certain actions related to its securities portfolio as follows:\n \u2022 Revalued its DTAs by $27 million, which was recorded as additional income tax expense in the Company's statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 Increased its minimum pay rate to $15 for hourly colleagues, effective in 2018. \n \u2022 Paid a special bonus of up to $1,035 to nearly 85% of colleagues. The aggregate amount of these bonuses was approximately $2 million on a pre-tax basis for the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 Contributed approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation, which supports charitable organizations in the communities the Company serves. \n \u2022 Liquidated all of its $46 million in trust-preferred collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\") at a minimal loss of approximately $800,000 late in the fourth quarter of 2017. This action improved the Company's total capital to risk-weighted assets by approximately 20 basis points. \n \u2022 Sold $150 million of collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") and other mortgage-backed securities (\"MBSs\") late in the fourth quarter of 2017 at a loss of approximately $5 million in order to invest the proceeds in higher-yielding securities with similar durations. \nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nTable 1\nSelected Financial Data\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>509,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share, adjusted (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average common equity, adjusted (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average tangible common equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average tangible common equity, adjusted (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets, adjusted (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-equivalent net interest margin (1)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) This is a non-GAAP financial measure.

A discussion of the allowance for acquired loan losses and the related acquisition adjustment is presented in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality.\" \n (3) The allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Performance Overview for 2017 Compared with 2016\nNet income for 2017 was $98.4 million, or $0.96 per share, compared to net income of $92.3 million, or $1.14 per share, for 2016. Performance for 2017 and 2016 was impacted by certain significant transactions, which include: revaluation of DTAs related to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates (2017), a special bonus to colleagues (2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (both 2017 and 2016), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), and a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction (2016). Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share was $1.35 for 2017 and $1.22 for 2016. The increase in net income and earnings per share reflects the benefit of the Standard and Premier acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the full year impact of the NI Bancshares acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2016, organic loan growth, and increases in fee-based revenues, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.87% for 2017 compared to 3.60% for 2016, driven primarily by an increase in acquired loan accretion, higher rates, and the additional portfolio of higher-yielding fixed rate loans acquired in the Standard transaction, partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio and the continued shift of loan originations and mix to lower-yielding floating rate loans.\nTotal noninterest income was $163.1 million for 2017 compared to $159.3 million for 2016. Total fee-based revenues increased by 6.9% for 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to services provided to customers acquired in the Standard and Premier transactions and organic growth in wealth management and treasury management services, partly offset by lower card-based fees.\nTotal noninterest expense was $415.9 million for 2017, increasing by 22.5% compared to 2016. This increase is primarily the result of operating costs associated with the Standard and Premier transactions and compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nA detailed discussion of net interest income and noninterest income and expense is presented in the following section of this Item 7 titled \"Earnings Performance\" below.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, down 1.8%, from December 31, 2016. For a detailed discussion of our securities portfolio, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Investment Portfolio Management\" below.\nTotal loans of $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 reflects growth of $2.2 billion, or 26.5%, from December 31, 2016. This growth was driven primarily by loans acquired in the Standard transaction and sales production of the corporate and consumer lending teams.\nNon-performing assets represented 0.89% of total loans plus OREO as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.12% as of December 31, 2016 and 0.88% as of December 31, 2015.\nFor a detailed discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\" below.\nTotal average funding sources of $11.9 billion for 2017 increased by $2.3 billion from 2016, due primarily to the deposits assumed in the Standard acquisition. For a detailed discussion of our funding sources see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Funding and Liquidity Management\" below.\nPerformance Overview for 2016 Compared with 2015\nNet income for 2016 was $92.3 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to $82.1 million, or $1.05 per share, for 2015. Performance for 2016 and 2015 was impacted by certain significant transactions: acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (both 2016 and 2015), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction (2016), and property valuation adjustments related to strategic branch initiatives (2015). Excluding these certain significant transactions, earnings per share was $1.22 for 2016 and $1.13 for 2015. The increase in net income and earnings per share reflects the benefit of the Peoples acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the NI Bancshares acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2016, organic loan growth, and increases in fee-based revenues, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and provision for loan losses.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% for 2016 compared to 3.68% for 2015, driven primarily by organic growth in floating rate loans, lower acquired loan accretion, and the addition of FHLB advances, partially offset by the reinvestment of other interest-earning assets into higher-yielding securities.\nTotal noninterest income was $159.3 million for 2016 compared to $136.6 million for 2015. Total fee-based revenues increased by 14.0% for 2016 compared to 2015, driven mainly by services provided to customers added in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions and continued growth in mortgage banking and capital market products income.\nTotal noninterest expense was $339.5 million for 2016, increasing by 10.5% compared to 2015. Excluding certain significant transactions, total noninterest expense was $324.2 million for 2016, increasing by $27.0 million, or 9.1%, from 2015. This increase is primarily the result of operating costs associated with the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions and compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nAs of December 31, 2016 our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, rising $612.8 million, or 46.9%, from December 31, 2015. Growth for 2016 reflects purchases of certain securities and $125.8 million in securities acquired in the NI Bancshares acquisition.\nTotal loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 reflects growth of $1.1 billion, or 15.3%, from December 31, 2015. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales production of the corporate and consumer lending teams and the acquisition of NI Bancshares, which represents $279.7 million of loans at December 31, 2016.\nNon-performing assets represented 1.12% of total loans plus OREO as of December 31, 2016 compared to 0.88% as of December 31, 2015.\nTotal average funding sources of $9.5 billion for 2016 increased by $1.1 billion from 2015, due primarily to the deposits assumed in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions and the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances.\nEARNINGS PERFORMANCE\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue and is impacted by interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The accounting policies for the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are presented in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and net interest margin have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt loans and securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets. The effect of this adjustment is shown at the bottom of Table 2. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, they should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"\nTable 2 summarizes our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the related interest income and interest expense for each earning asset category and funding source, and the average interest rates earned and paid. Table 3 details differences in interest income and expense from prior years and the extent to which any changes are attributable to volume and rate fluctuations.\nTable 2\nNet Interest Income and

federal income tax rate of 35%. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded in income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income. For a discussion of tax-equivalent net interest income/margin, net interest income (GAAP), and tax-equivalent net interest income/margin, adjusted, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \n (2) Non-accrual loans, which totaled $66.9 million as of December 31, 2017, $59.3 million as of December 31, 2016, and $29.4 million as of December 31, 2015, are included in loans for purposes of this analysis. Additional detail regarding non-accrual loans is presented in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-Performing Assets and Performing Potential Problem Loans.\" \n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet interest income was $472.0 million for 2017 compared to $349.7 million for 2016, an increase of 35.0%. This increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of interest-earning assets and acquired loan accretion from the Standard transaction early in the first quarter of 2017, organic loan growth, and higher interest rates.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $33.9 million and $14.6 million to net interest income for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.87% for 2017, increasing by 27 basis points from 2016. The rise in tax-equivalent net interest margin was driven primarily by a 13 basis point increase in acquired loan accretion combined with the positive impact of higher interest rates. In addition, the impact of adding a portfolio of higher-yielding fixed-rate loans acquired from Standard contributed to the increase, partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio and the continued shift of loan originations and mix to lower-yielding floating rate loans.\nTotal average interest-earning assets were $12.4 billion for 2017, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 24.8%, from 2016. The increase resulted from interest-earning assets acquired in the Standard transaction, loan growth, and security purchases. In addition, interest-earning assets acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the increase.\nTotal average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.5 billion to $8.3 billion for 2017 from $6.8 billion for 2016. The increase resulted primarily from deposits acquired in the Standard transaction and the addition of FHLB advances during 2017. Deposits acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction also contributed to the increase.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTax-equivalent net interest income was $358.3 million for 2016 compared to $322.3 million for 2015, an increase of 11.2%. This increase was driven primarily by organic loan growth, the acquisition of interest-earning assets from the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 and the Peoples transaction late in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the redeployment of other interest-earning assets into securities, partially offset by higher borrowed funds costs from the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances during 2016.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $14.6 million and $16.3 million to net interest income for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% for 2016, decreasing 8 basis points from 2015. The decline was due primarily to organic growth in floating rate loans, lower acquired loan accretion, and the addition of FHLB advances, partially offset by the reinvestment of other interest-earning assets into higher-yielding securities.\nTotal average interest-earning assets were $10.0 billion for 2016, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 13.5%, from 2015, which reflects organic loan growth and security purchases, as well as $528.8 million of interest-earning assets acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction and $96.2 million of interest-earning assets acquired in the Peoples transaction.\nCompared to 2015, total average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $860.3 million, or 14.4%, during 2016. The increase resulted primarily from deposits acquired in the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions and the addition of FHLB advances during 2016.\nTable 3\nChanges in Net Interest Income Applicable to Volumes and Interest Rates (1)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 compared to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest-earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,794\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading -

Excluding the negative $6.3 million impact to card-based fees due to the reduction in interchange revenue as the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (\"Durbin\") became effective in the second half of 2017, total fee-based revenues increased by 11.3% from 2016. Fee-based revenues were positively impacted by services provided to customers acquired in the Standard and Premier transactions completed in the first quarter of 2017 and organic growth in wealth management and treasury management services. Assets under management grew to $10.7 billion, a rise of $2.1 billion, or 24.1%, from 2016, driven primarily by organic growth and the addition of $863.4 million in trust assets under management from the Standard and Premier transactions, which contributed approximately $5.6 million to wealth management fees during 2017. In addition, the full year impact of customers acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the increase in fee-based revenues compared to 2016.\nThe decline in merchant servicing fees reflected lower customer volumes, offset by the decline in merchant card expense included in noninterest expense. The decline in capital market products income compared to 2016 was in-line with lower origination volumes compared to the same period.\nMortgage banking income during 2017 resulted from sales of $252.7 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market compared to sales of $283.3 million during 2016. In addition, mortgage banking income for 2017 was negatively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from year to year.\nBOLI income for 2017 was positively impacted by benefit settlements.\nNet securities losses of $1.9 million were recognized during 2017 in connection with gains from the strategic repositioning of the securities portfolio in the third quarter, which were more than offset by losses in the fourth quarter due to certain actions taken in light of federal income tax reform.\nDuring 2016, the Company completed a sale-leaseback transaction of 55 branches that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $88.0 million, net of transaction related expenses, of which $5.5 million was immediately recognized and the remaining $82.5 million was\ndeferred and will be accreted over future periods. Accretion related to the deferred gain was $5.9 million and $1.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in net occupancy and equipment expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal noninterest income was $159.3 million for 2016, increasing by 16.6% from 2015. Total fee-based revenues were $145.1 million, rising by 14.0% compared to 2015, reflecting growth across all categories. Approximately one-third of the increase in fee-based revenues was driven by services provided to customers acquired in the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions. In addition, card-based fees increased as a result of higher transaction volumes and capital market products income grew due to higher sales to commercial clients.\nThe increase in mortgage banking income during 2016 was due primarily to sales of $283.3 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market compared to sales of $180.0 million during 2015. In addition, mortgage banking income for 2016 was positively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from year to year.\nAssets under management grew to $8.6 billion, a rise of $1.2 billion, or 15.7%, from 2015, driven primarily by the addition of $700.0 million in trust assets under management from the NI Bancshares transaction, which contributed approximately $4.0 million to wealth management fees during 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nA summary of noninterest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2017 is presented in the following

included in noninterest income for each period presented.  2017 Compared to 2016\nTotal noninterest expense for 2017 increased by 22.5% compared to 2016. Salaries and wages and advertising and promotions expense were impacted by the special bonus and charitable contribution in connection with federal income tax reform in 2017. In addition, both periods were impacted by acquisition and integration related expenses and 2016 was impacted by a lease cancellation fee as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation. Excluding these items, total noninterest expense increased to $392.3 million, up 21.0% compared to $324.2 million in 2016. Operating costs associated with the Standard and Premier transactions, which impacted most categories, drove the increase in total noninterest expense from 2016.\nThe increase in salaries and wages was also impacted by merit increases and investments in additional talent to support growth. Higher loan remediation expenses and certain costs associated with organizational growth contributed to the rise in professional services. Net OREO expense increased due to higher valuation adjustments and operating expenses, partially offset by net gains on sales of OREO properties.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal noninterest expense for 2016 increased by 10.5% compared to 2015. For both years, total noninterest expense was impacted by certain significant transactions: acquisition and integration related expenses (both 2016 and 2015), the lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), and property valuation adjustments related to strategic branch initiatives (2015). Excluding these adjustments, total noninterest expense was $324.2 million for 2016, increasing by $27.0 million, or 9.1%, from 2015. Operating costs associated with the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions drove the increase in total noninterest expense from 2015. These costs occurred primarily within salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expense, advertising and promotions, and other expenses. In addition, the increase in salaries and wages for 2016 was impacted by compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nNet OREO expense for 2016 decreased by 42.7% compared to 2015 due to reduced valuation adjustments and lower operating expenses, partially offset by net losses on sales of OREO properties realized during 2016.\nCompared to 2015, the increase in professional services and a portion of the rise in other expenses resulted from organizational growth needs for 2016. In addition, higher loan remediation expenses and vendor commissions related to the origination of equipment finance loans contributed to the increase in professional services from 2015.\nProperty valuation adjustments of $8.6 million were recognized during 2015 on twelve closed branches and seven parcels of land as part of the Company's strategic branch initiatives.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense.

For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Federal income tax expense and the related effective income tax rate are influenced by the amount of tax-exempt income derived from investment securities and BOLI in relation to pre-tax income as well as state income taxes. State income tax expense and the related effective income tax rate are driven by the amount of state tax-exempt income in relation to pre-tax income and state tax rules related to consolidated/combined reporting and sourcing of income and expense.\nFederal income tax reform was enacted on December 22, 2017. Among other things, the new law (i) establishes a new, flat corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21%, (ii) eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows the use of any such carryforwards to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, (iii) limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by U.S. corporations, (iv) allows businesses to immediately expense, for tax purposes, the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets, (v) eliminates or reduces certain deductions related to meals and entertainment expenses, (vi) modifies the\nlimitation on excessive employee remuneration to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation and clarifies the definition of a covered employee, and (vii) limits the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums. Federal income tax reform also significantly changes U.S. tax law related to foreign operations, however, such changes do not currently impact the Company.\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was impacted by the downward revaluation of DTAs by $26.6 million in the fourth quarter due to federal income tax reform as well as a $2.8 million benefit in the third quarter as a result of changes in Illinois income tax rates. Excluding these items, the Company's effective income tax rate was 35.0% for 2017 compared to 33.3% for 2016, up due to a rise in income subject to tax at statutory rates and increases in state statutory rates. The increases in income tax expense and the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 were due primarily to a rise in income subject to tax at statutory rates, partially offset by decreases in state statutory rates.\nOur accounting policies regarding the recognition of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Income are described in Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Portfolio Management\nSecurities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as securities held-to-maturity and are accounted for using historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Trading securities are carried at fair value and consist of securities held in a grantor trust for our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and are not considered part of the traditional investment portfolio. All other securities are classified as securities available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nWe manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, to meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income.\nFrom time to time, we adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio based on a number of factors, including expected loan growth, anticipated changes in collateralized public funds on account, the interest rate environment, and the related value of various segments of the securities markets.

securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, decreasing by $35.2 million, or 1.8%, from December 31, 2016, following a 46.9% increase from December 31, 2015. The decrease from December 31, 2016 was driven by securities sales of $629.8 million and $349.4 million of maturities, calls, and prepayments, partially offset by purchases of $733.4 million, consisting primarily of CMOs and MBSs. Purchase and sale activity during 2017 was driven primarily by the opportunistic repositioning of the securities portfolio in light of market conditions in the second half of the year as well as strategic actions in connection with federal income tax reform. The proceeds from sales of securities were reinvested in higher-yielding securities with similar durations. For additional detail regarding sales of securities, see the \"Realized Losses and Gains\" section of this Item 7 below.\nInvestments in municipal securities consist of general obligations of local municipalities in various states.

This measure is used to evaluate the portfolio's price volatility at a single point in time and is not intended to be a precise predictor of future fair values since those values will be influenced by a number of factors. \n (2) Average life is presented in years and represents the weighted-average time to receive half of all expected future cash flows using the dollar amount of principal paydowns, including estimated principal prepayments, as the weighting factor. \n (3) Yields on municipal securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%.  Effective Duration\nThe average life and effective duration of our securities available-for-sale portfolio were 4.51 years and 3.38%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, compared to 4.27 and 3.72% as of December 31, 2016. The increase in average life and decrease in effective duration resulted from maturities and sales of securities that were reinvested in higher-yielding, lower-duration CMOs and MBSs.\nRealized Losses and Gains\nThere were $1.9 million of net securities losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 on securities with carrying values of $631.7 million. Net securities losses for 2017 were driven primarily by the opportunistic repositioning of the securities portfolio in light of market conditions in the second half of the year as well as strategic actions in connection with federal income tax reform, which included the liquidation of $47.7 million of CDOs. In addition, $214.1 million of securities were acquired in the Standard transaction during the first quarter of 2017, of which $210.2 million were sold shortly after the acquisition date and resulted in no gains or losses as they were recorded at fair value upon acquisition.\nNet securities gains of $1.4 million for 2016 resulted from the sale of municipal securities at gains of $1.1 million, and sales of MBSs and CMOs at net gains of $304,000.\nNet securities gains of $2.4 million for 2015 resulted from the sale of MBSs at gains of $1.9 million, and sales of CMOs, municipal securities, and other investments at net gains of $521,000.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nUnrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio. These amounts are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss on an after-tax basis. This balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change and affect the aggregate fair value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, net unrealized losses totaled $23.6 million compared to net unrealized losses of $38.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease is due primarily to the sale of CDOs in 2017, which had unrealized losses of $14.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nNet unrealized losses in the CMO portfolio totaled $17.8 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $16.7 million as of December 31, 2016. CMOs are either backed by U.S. government-owned agencies or issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. We do not believe any individual unrealized loss on these securities as of December 31, 2017 represents OTTI related to credit deterioration. In addition, we do not intend to sell the CMOs with unrealized losses and we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. For additional discussion of unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, see Note 4 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 9\nRepricing Distribution and Portfolio Yields\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Five Years to Ten Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield to Maturity (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMOs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>812,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBSs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available-for-sale\nsecurities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,367,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Held-to-Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M -

Maturity dates are based on contractual maturity or repricing characteristics. \nLOAN PORTFOLIO AND CREDIT QUALITY\nOur principal source of revenue is generated by our lending activities and is composed primarily of interest income as well as loan origination and commitment fees (net of related costs). The accounting policies for the recording of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the recognition and/or deferral of interest income and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income are included in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur loan portfolio is comprised of both corporate and consumer loans with corporate loans representing 81.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. Consistent with our emphasis on relationship banking, the majority of our corporate loans are made to our core, multi-relationship customers. The customers usually maintain deposit relationships and utilize our other banking services, such as treasury or wealth management services.\nTo maximize loan income with an acceptable level of risk, we have certain lending policies and procedures that management reviews on a regular basis. In addition, management receives periodic reporting related to loan production, loan quality, credit concentrations, loan delinquencies, and non-performing and corporate performing potential problem loans to monitor and mitigate potential and current risks in the portfolio.\nTable 10\nLoan Portfolio\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Table 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

of December 31, 2017 reflect growth of $2.2 billion, or 26.5%, from December 31, 2016. Excluding loans related to customers and locations acquired in the Standard transaction, total loans grew by approximately 7% from December 31, 2016. Growth in commercial and industrial loans, primarily within our sector-based lending businesses and multi-family loans, contributed to the increase in total corporate loans. Total loans were also impacted by the addition of 1-4 family mortgages, installment loans, and shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 reflect growth of $1.1 billion, or 15.3%, from December 31, 2015 including loans acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction of $279.7 million, or 11.3%, excluding these acquired loans. Growth in commercial and industrial loans resulted primarily from broad-based increases within our middle market and sector-based lending business units. Office, retail, and industrial and multi-family loans increased compared to December 31, 2015 due to organic growth. The rise in construction loans compared to the same period was driven primarily by select commercial projects for which permanent\nfinancing is expected upon their completion. The rise in consumer loans compared to December 31, 2015 resulted from the continued expansion of mortgage and installment loans and the addition of shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans.\nComparisons of Prior Years (2015, 2014, and 2013)\nTotal loans of $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 reflect growth of $424.9 million, or 6.3%, from December 31, 2014. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales production of the corporate lending teams and growth in consumer loans. In addition, the Peoples acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 contributed $53.9 million in loans. Growth in corporate loans was concentrated within our commercial and industrial loan category, reflective of the continued expansion into sector-based lending areas. The overall decline in commercial real estate loans from December 31, 2014 resulted from the decision of certain customers to opportunistically sell their commercial businesses and investment real estate properties or use excess liquidity to payoff long-term debt. These decreases more than offset organic commercial real estate growth. Consumer loans totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and increased $227.9 million, or 24.0%, from December 31, 2014. This growth reflects the addition of shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans, and growth in 1-4 family mortgages.\nTotal loans of $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 reflected growth of $1.0 billion, or 17.9%, from December 31, 2013. Excluding loans acquired in the Popular and Great Lakes transactions of $718.3 million, total loans grew $304.2 million from December 31, 2013. Solid performance from our legacy sales platform concentrated within our commercial and industrial, agricultural, and multi-family loan categories reflected the continued impact of greater resource investments and expansion into sector-based lending areas. Excluding loans acquired in the Popular and Great Lakes transactions of $93.5 million, consumer loans increased $60.0 million, or 7.5%, which reflects the addition of shorter-duration home equity loans.\nCommercial, Industrial, and Agricultural Loans\nCommercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represent 37.9% of total loans, and totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $743.6 million, or 23.1%, from December 31, 2016. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans generally located in the Chicago metropolitan area with purposes that include supporting seasonal working capital needs, accounts receivable financing, inventory and equipment financing, and select sector-based lending, such as healthcare, asset-based lending, structured finance, and syndications. Our commercial and industrial portfolio does not have significant direct exposure to the oil and gas industry. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory. The underlying collateral securing commercial and industrial loans may fluctuate in value due to the success of the business or economic conditions. For loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for repayment and economic conditions may impact the cash flow of the borrower. Accordingly, the underwriting for these loans is based primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower and may incorporate a personal guarantee.\nAgricultural loans are generally provided to meet seasonal production, equipment, and farm real estate borrowing needs of individual and corporate crop and livestock producers. Seasonal crop production loans are repaid by the liquidation of the financed crop that is typically covered by crop insurance. Equipment and real estate term loans are repaid through cash flows of the farming operation. Risks uniquely inherent in agricultural loans relate to weather conditions, agricultural product pricing, and loss of crops or livestock due to disease or other factors. Therefore, as part of the underwriting process, the Company examines projected future cash flows, financial statement stability, and the value of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. The repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. This category of loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market. In addition, many commercial real estate loans do not fully amortize over the term of the loan, but have balloon payments due at maturity. The borrower's ability to make a balloon payment may depend on the availability of long-term financing or their ability to complete a timely sale of the underlying property. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography, and risk rating criteria.\nConstruction loans are generally made based on estimates of costs and values associated with the completed projects and are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analyses of absorption and lease rates, and financial analyses of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment may be permanent long-term financing, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment until permanent financing is obtained. Generally, construction loans have a higher risk profile than other real estate loans since repayment is impacted by real estate values, interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, demand and supply of alternative real estate, the availability of long-term financing, and changes in general economic conditions.\nThe following table provides commercial real estate loan

of properties securing the loans in our commercial real estate portfolio is balanced between owner-occupied and investor categories and is diverse in terms of type and geographic location, generally within the Company's markets. Approximately 43% of the commercial real estate portfolio, excluding multi-family and construction loans, is owner-occupied as of December 31, 2017. Using outstanding loan balances, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total capital was 213% and construction loans to total capital was 28% as of December 31, 2017. Non-owner-occupied (investor) commercial real estate is calculated in accordance with federal banking agency guidelines and includes construction, multi-family, non-farm non-residential property, and commercial real estate loans that are not secured by real estate collateral.\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer loans represent 18.4% of total loans, and totaled $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $513.5 million, or 36.4%, from December 31, 2016. Consumer loans are centrally underwritten using a credit scoring model developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\"), which employs a risk-based system to determine the probability that a borrower may default. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include loan-to-value and affordability ratios, risk-based pricing strategies, and documentation requirements. The home equity category consists mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by junior liens on owner-occupied real estate. Loan-to-value ratios on home equity loans and 1-4 family mortgages are based on the current appraised value of the collateral. Repayment for these loans is dependent on the borrower's continued financial stability, and is more likely to be impacted by adverse personal circumstances.\nMaturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Corporate Loans\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of our corporate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, For additional discussion of interest rate sensitivity, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Form 10-K.\nTable 12\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Corporate Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Table 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Due In\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than One to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater Than Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, industrial, and agricultural\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,716,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>752,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,960,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,041,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,737,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>774,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,553,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total corporate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,454,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,527,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,514,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans by interest rate type:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,097,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,898,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,334,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floating interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,435,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,555,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,188,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,179,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total corporate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,532,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,454,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,527,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,514,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, the composition of our corporate loans between fixed and floating interest rates was 39% and 61%, respectively.

Non-performing Assets\nTotal non-performing assets represented 0.89% of total loans and OREO at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.12% and 0.88% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in non-performing assets as of December 31, 2017 was $5.3 million of OREO acquired in the Standard transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2016, non-performing assets increased by $29.7 million, or 47.1%, from December 31, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of five corporate loan relationships to non-accrual status during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2015, non-performing assets decreased by $48.0 million, or 43.2%, from December 31, 2014, due mainly to lower levels of non-accrual loans. The improvement in non-accrual loans related primarily to the final resolution of a large commercial loan relationship originally identified in the second half of 2014, for which a specific reserve was then established. In addition, lower levels of covered non-performing assets contributed to the decrease.\nNon-performing assets decreased by $56.6 million, or 33.8%, from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by the return of three TDRs totaling $20.7 million to performing status, sales of OREO properties, and a decline in 90 days or more past due loans.\nTDRs\nLoan modifications may be performed at the request of an individual borrower and may include reductions in interest rates, changes in payments, and extensions of maturity dates. We occasionally restructure loans at other than market rates or terms to enable the borrower to work through financial difficulties for a period of time, and these restructured loans remain classified as TDRs for the remaining terms of the loans. A discussion of our accounting policies for TDRs can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 15\nTDRs by Type\n(Dollar amounts in

The increase was driven primarily by the extension of two non-accrual credits during 2017. The December 31, 2017 total includes $1.8 million in loans that are accruing interest, with the majority restructured at market terms. After a sufficient period of performance under the modified terms, the loans restructured at market rates will be reclassified to performing status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, TDRs totaled $8.6 million, increasing by $3.5 million from December 31, 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the addition of two corporate loan relationships to non-accrual TDR status.\nCorporate Performing Potential Problem Loans\nCorporate performing potential problem loans consist of special mention loans and substandard loans, excluding accruing TDRs. These loans are performing in accordance with their contractual terms, but we have concerns about the ability of the borrower to continue to comply with loan terms due to the borrower's operating or financial difficulties.\nTable 16\nCorporate Performing Potential Problem Loans\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Special\nMention (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Substandard (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Special\nMention (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Substandard (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total (3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office, retail, and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total corporate performing\npotential problem loans(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate performing potential\nproblem loans to corporate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate PCI performing potential\nproblem loans included in the total\nabove\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Loans categorized as special mention exhibit potential weaknesses that require the close attention of management since these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of repayment prospects in the future. \n (2) Loans categorized as substandard exhibit a well-defined weakness that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.

Determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of current economic trends.\nAcquired loans are recorded at fair value, which incorporates credit risk, at the date of acquisition. No allowance for credit losses is recorded on the acquisition date for such loans. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. In addition, certain acquired loans that have renewed subsequent to their respective acquisition dates are no longer classified as acquired loans. Instead, they are included with our loan population that is allocated an allowance in accordance with our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nWhile management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for credit losses depends on a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, including the performance of its loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and property values, and the interpretation of loan risk ratings by regulatory authorities. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is an appropriate estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nThe accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAn allowance for credit losses is established on loans originated by the Bank, acquired loans, and covered loans. Additional discussion regarding acquired and covered loans can be found in Notes 1 and 6 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table provides additional details related to acquired loans, the allowance for credit losses as related to acquired loans, and the remaining acquisition adjustment associated with acquired loans as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 19\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Acquisition Adjustment\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loans, Excluding Acquired Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquired Loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,644\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,822,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,615,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,437,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses to total loans (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment to acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,620,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,254,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses to total loans (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining acquisition adjustment to acquired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A - Not applicable.\n (1) These amounts and ratios relate to the loans acquired in completed acquisitions. \n (2) The remaining acquisition adjustment consists of $43.5 million and $31.2 million relating to PCI and non-purchased credit impaired (\"non-PCI\") loans, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, and $10.8 million and $11.8 million relating to PCI and non-PCI loans, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. \n (3) The allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Excluding acquired loans, the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.07% as of December 31, 2017. The acquisition adjustment increased by $52.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the Standard transaction. This was partially offset by acquired loan accretion, resulting in a remaining acquisition adjustment as a percent of acquired loans of 4.62% as of December 31, 2017. Acquired loans that are renewed are no longer classified as acquired loans. These loans totaled $366.0 million and $117.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in loans, excluding acquired loans, in the table above and allocated an allowance in accordance with our allowance for loan losses methodology.

See the Allowance for Credit Losses and Acquisition Adjustment table above for further discussion of the allowance for acquired loan losses and the related acquisition adjustment. \n (3) The allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \nActivity in the Allowance for Credit Losses\nNet loan charge-offs to average loans declined to 0.21% for 2017 compared to 0.24% for 2016 and 0.29% for 2015. The improvement since 2013, and all other prior periods presented, reflects management's continued efforts to remediate problem credits.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased to $96.7 million as of December 31, 2017 from $87.1 million as of December 31, 2016, and $74.9 million as of December 31, 2015, driven primarily by loan growth and the impact of establishing an allowance on acquired loans. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses to total loans to 0.93% as of December 31, 2017 from 1.06% as of December 31, 2016 was due primarily to loans acquired in the Standard transaction.\nThe allowance for credit losses remained consistent at $74.9 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $74.5 million as of December 31, 2014. This stability in the allowance for credit losses reflects the sustained improvement in our non-performing loan levels and the related credit metrics.\nThe allowance for credit losses declined by 14.5% to $74.5 million as of December 31, 2014 from $87.1 million as of December 31, 2013, reflecting reductions across most categories. This decrease in the allowance for credit losses reflected continuing improvement in our non-performing loans and the related credit metrics resulting from management's ongoing credit remediation

INSURANCE\nWe previously purchased life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors and officers and are the sole owner and beneficiary of the policies. We invested in these BOLI policies to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefit costs. Therefore, our BOLI policies are intended to be long-term investments to provide funding for long-term liabilities. We record these BOLI policies as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at each policy's respective cash surrender value (\"CSV\") with changes recorded as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2017, the CSV of BOLI assets totaled $279.9 million. Income and proceeds for BOLI policies are not subject to income taxation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 50.1% of our total BOLI portfolio is invested in general account life insurance distributed among fifteen insurance carriers, all of which carry investment grade ratings. This general account life insurance typically includes a feature guaranteeing minimum returns. The remaining 49.9% is in separate account life insurance, which is managed by third-party investment advisors under pre-determined investment guidelines. Stable value protection is a feature available for separate account life insurance policies that is designed to protect a policy's CSV from market fluctuations, within limits, on underlying investments. Our entire separate account portfolio has stable value protection purchased from a highly rated financial institution. To the extent fair values on individual contracts fall below 80% of their CSV, the CSV of the specific contracts may be reduced or the underlying assets may be transferred to short-duration investments, resulting in lower earnings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had BOLI income of $5.9 million compared to prior year BOLI income of $3.6 million.\nGOODWILL\nThe carrying amount of goodwill was $697.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and $340.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Goodwill increased by $356.7 million from December 31, 2016, which consisted of $345.3 million related to the Standard acquisition, $11.0 million related to the Premier acquisition, and a $423,000 measurement period adjustment related to finalizing the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the NI Bancshares acquisition. For additional detail regarding goodwill, see Note 9 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate a need to perform interim tests, as described in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2017, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill at October 1, 2017 and determined that goodwill was not impaired at that date and there was no indication that goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income tax expense recorded due to changes in uncertain tax positions is also described in Note 15.\nTable 22\nDeferred Tax Assets\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net DTAs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement assessed whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the DTAs will not be realized. This assessment considered whether, in the periods of reversal, the DTAs can be realized through carryback to income in prior years, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, and future taxable income, including taxable income resulting from the application of future tax planning strategies. The assessment also considered positive and negative evidence, including pre-tax income during the current and prior two years, actual performance compared to budget, trends in non-performing assets and corporate performing potential problem loans, the Company's capital position, and any unsettled circumstances that could impact future earnings. Based on this assessment, management determined that it is more likely than not that our DTAs will be fully realized and no valuation allowance is required as of December 31, 2017.\nNet DTAs decreased in 2017 due primarily to the downward revaluation of DTAs by $26.6 million related to federal income tax reform, partly offset by a $2.8 million benefit due to changes in the Illinois income tax rates. In addition, accelerated tax gains associated with the disposition of assets resulting from the sale-leaseback transaction and securities valuation adjustments, partially offset by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards contributed to the decrease. Net DTAs increased in 2016 due primarily to accelerated tax gains associated with the disposition of assets resulting from the sale-leaseback transaction and securities valuation adjustments, partially offset by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nFUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flows as they become due. Our approach to liquidity management is to obtain funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit, withdrawal, and loan demand needs. Our liquidity policy establishes parameters to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a 12-month forward-looking period, including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the Bank's Board of Directors. The compliance plan includes an analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds and incorporates a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly. Based on these assumptions, we determine our total cash liquidity on hand and excess collateral capacity from pledging, unused federal funds purchased lines, and other unused borrowing capacity, such as FHLB advances, resulting in a calculation of our total liquidity capacity. Our total policy-directed liquidity requirement is to have funding sources available to cover 50.0% of non-collateralized, non-FDIC insured, non-maturity deposits. Based on our projections as of December 31, 2017, we expect to have liquidity capacity in excess of policy guidelines for the forward twelve-month period.\nThe liquidity needs of First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis (the \"Parent Company\") consist primarily of operating expenses, debt service payments, and dividend payments to our stockholders, which totaled $82.6 million for the year\nended December 31, 2017. The primary source of liquidity for the Parent Company is dividends from subsidiaries. The Parent Company had $48.2 million in junior subordinated debentures, $146.9 million in subordinated notes, and cash and interest-bearing deposits of $120.8 million as of December 31, 2017. On September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association providing for a $50.0 million short-term, unsecured revolving credit facility. On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into a first amendment to this credit facility, which extends the maturity to September 26, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding under the facility. The Parent Company has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt.\nTotal deposits and borrowed funds as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in Notes 10 and 11 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table provides a comparison of average funding sources over the last three years. We believe that average balances, rather than period-end balances, are more meaningful in analyzing funding sources because of the normal fluctuations that may occur on a daily or monthly basis within funding categories.\nTable 23\nFunding Sources - Average Balances\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nAverage borrowed funds totaled $622.1 million, $497.6 million, and $151.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 from 2016 and in 2016 from 2015 was due primarily to higher levels of FHLB advances. The weighted-average rate on FHLB advances for the year-to-date periods was impacted by the hedging of $415.0 million and $325.0 million of FHLB advances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, using interest rate swaps through which the Company receives variable amounts and pays fixed amounts. The weighted-average interest rate paid on these interest rate swaps was 2.17% and 2.19% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For further discussion of interest rate swaps, see Note 19 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association providing for a $50.0 million short-term, unsecured revolving credit facility. On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into a first amendment to this credit facility, which extends the maturity to September 26, 2018. Advances will bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, adjusted on a monthly basis, and the Company must pay an unused facility fee equal to 0.35% per annum on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding under the facility.\nWe make interchangeable use of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, and federal funds purchased to supplement deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within 1 to 90 days from the transaction date.\nSenior and Subordinated Debt\nAverage senior and subordinated debt decreased by $2.6 million, or 1.3%, from 2016 to 2017 and $3.5 million, or 1.8%, from 2015 to 2016. These decreases resulted from the timing of the maturity and repayment of $38.5 million of 5.850% subordinated notes on April 1, 2016 and $115.0 million of the Company's 5.875% senior notes on November 22, 2016, which were partly offset by the issuance and sale of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% subordinated notes due 2026, issued on September 29, 2016. See Note 12 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding these transactions.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThrough our normal course of operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. These obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for our loans.\nThe following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as of December 31, 2017.

Our capital policy requires that the Company and the Bank maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines. It serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities and sets targeted levels of return on equity. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies. On January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital rules, a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations published by the Federal Reserve. These rules are discussed in the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section in Item 1, \"Business\" of this Form 10-K. In addition, financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital. The Company submitted its first required stress test report for the July 31, 2017 reporting date and the Bank will become subject to these stress test requirements starting with the July 31, 2018 reporting date.\nThe following table presents our consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the Federal Reserve for the Bank to be categorized as \"well-capitalized.\" We manage our capital ratios for both the Company and the Bank to consistently maintain these measurements in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum levels to be considered \"well-capitalized,\" which is the highest capital category established. All regulatory mandated ratios for characterization as \"well-capitalized\" were exceeded as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nThe tangible common equity ratios presented in the table below are capital adequacy metrics used and relied on by investors and industry analysts; however, they are non-GAAP financial measures.

For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \nOverall, the Company's regulatory capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2016, due primarily to retained earnings and certain actions taken by management to sell all of its $47.7 million in CDOs, which received significantly higher risk-weightings for regulatory capital ratio calculation purposes. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the Standard and Premier acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Board reviews the Company's capital plan each quarter, considering the current and expected operating environment as well as evaluating various capital alternatives. For further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 for the Company and the Bank, see Note 18 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nThe Company maintains a Board-approved stock repurchase program by which shares of Company common stock may be repurchased. Shares repurchased, whether as part of or outside of the Board-approved program, are held as treasury stock and are available for issuance in connection with our qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, share-based compensation plans, and other general corporate purposes. We reissued 133,907 treasury shares in 2017 and 119,823 treasury shares in 2016 pursuant to these plans.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and for each of the quarters through the first quarter of 2017. The Company increased the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share for each of the quarters from the second quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 represents the 140th consecutive cash dividend paid by the Company since its inception in 1983.\nQUARTERLY EARNINGS\nTable 28\nQuarterly Earnings

measures. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Quarterly earnings performance was impacted by certain significant transactions for all periods presented, which include: the downward revaluation of DTAs by $23.7 million due to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates (third and fourth quarters of 2017), certain actions related to the securities portfolio resulting in pre-tax net securities losses of $2.2 million (third and fourth quarters of 2017), a special bonus to colleagues of $1.9 million pre-tax and a charitable contribution of $1.6 million pre-tax (fourth quarter of 2017), pre-tax acquisition and integration related expenses of $384,000, $1.2 million, $18.6 million, $7.5 million, $1.2 million, $618,000, and $5.0 million (third, second and first quarters of 2017 and fourth, third, second, and first quarters of 2016, respectively), a lease cancellation fee of $950,000 pre-tax (fourth quarter of 2016), and gain on a sale-leaseback transaction of $5.5 million pre-tax (third quarter of 2016). Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share was $0.34, $0.33, $0.35, and $0.34 for the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of 2017, respectively, compared to $0.32 for each of the fourth, third, and second quarters of 2016 and $0.27 for the first quarter of 2016.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and are consistent with general practices within the banking industry. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on the best available information as of the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations. Future changes in information may impact these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which may have a material effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.\nThe most significant of our accounting policies and estimates are presented in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, these policies provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates, assumptions, and judgments underlying those amounts, management determined that our accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, valuation of securities, income taxes, and goodwill and other intangible assets are considered to be our critical accounting estimates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans, actual loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, and other factors, all of which are susceptible to significant change. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are established through the provision for loan losses charged to expense. The amount charged to operating expense depends on a number of factors, including historic loan growth, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-off levels, and our assessment of the allowance for loan losses. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, see Notes 1 and 7 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nValuation of Securities\nThe fair values of securities are based on quoted prices obtained from third-party pricing services or dealer market participants where a ready market for such securities exists. In the absence of quoted prices or where a market for the security does not exist, management judgment and estimation is used, which may include modeling-based techniques. The use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair value of securities could result in a different fair value estimate.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess securities with unrealized losses to determine whether OTTI has occurred. In evaluating OTTI, management considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including external credit ratings and recent downgrades for debt securities, intent to hold the security until its value recovers, and the likelihood that the Company would be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value, which may be at maturity. The term \"other-than-temporary\" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent. It indicates that the prospects for near-term recovery are not necessarily favorable or there is a lack of evidence to support fair values greater than or equal to the carrying value of the investment. Securities for which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss and included in net securities (losses) gains, but only to the extent the impairment is related to credit deterioration. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) unless management intends to sell the security in a short period of time or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to full recovery. The determination of OTTI is subjective and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing and amount of loss realization. For additional discussion of securities, see Notes 1 and 4 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences result in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nWe assess the likelihood that any DTAs will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management makes judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning\nstrategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that DTAs included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nManagement also makes certain interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of the tax position may not be certain. Uncertain tax positions are periodically evaluated and we may establish tax reserves for benefits that may not be realized. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, both intangible and tangible, be recorded at their estimated fair value upon acquisition. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized, instead, we assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nOther intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance, but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. The determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For additional discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 1 and 9 of \"Notes to the Consolidated financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RECONCILIATIONS\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, adjusted, tax-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), tax-equivalent net interest margin, tax-equivalent net interest margin, adjusted, effective income tax rate, excluding revaluations of DTAs, return on average common equity, adjusted, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), to tangible assets, tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, adjusted.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, all adjusted for certain significant transactions. These transaction include the revaluation of DTAs (fourth and third quarters of 2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (fourth quarter and third quarters of 2017), a special bonus to colleagues (fourth quarter of 2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (fourth quarter of 2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (all periods presented, excluding the fourth quarter of 2017), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (fourth quarter of 2016), a net gain on sale-leaseback transaction (third quarter of 2016), property valuation adjustments (2015), a gain on the sale of an equity investment (2013), losses on early extinguishment of debt (2013), gain on the termination of FHLB commitments (2013), adjusted amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset (2013), and a BOLI modification loss (2013). Management believes excluding these transactions from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity is useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these transactions do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion facilitates better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding acquisition and integration related expenses from these metrics is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and assumes a 35% tax rate. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. In addition, management believes that presenting tax-equivalent net interest margin, excluding the impact of acquired loan accretion, enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes and is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since acquired loan accretion income may fluctuate based on the size of each acquisition, as well as from period to period.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nThe Company presents the allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans. Management believes excluding acquired loans is useful as it facilitates better comparability between periods as these loans are recorded at fair value, which incorporates credit risk, at the date of acquisition. No allowance for credit losses is recorded on the acquisition date. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. See Table 20 in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\" for details on the calculation of this measure.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. See the following reconciliations for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nTable 181:

", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nFirst Midwest Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Itasca, Illinois with operations throughout the Chicago metropolitan area as well as northwest Indiana, central and western Illinois, and eastern Iowa through 135 banking locations. Our principal subsidiary, First Midwest Bank, and other affiliates provide a broad range of commercial, retail, treasury management, and wealth management products and services to commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, municipal, and consumer customers. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of the people and businesses in the communities where we live and work by providing customized banking solutions, quality products, and innovative services that fulfill those financial needs.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three years ended December 31, 2017 and Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. When we use the terms \"First Midwest,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our,\" we mean First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term \"Bank,\" we are referring to our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, First Midwest Bank. Management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including interest rates, local and national economic conditions, business spending, consumer confidence, legislative and regulatory changes, certain seasonal factors, and changes in real estate and securities markets. Our management evaluates performance using a variety of qualitative and quantitative metrics. The primary quantitative metrics used by management include:\n \u2022 Net Interest Income - Net interest income, our primary source of revenue, equals the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \n \u2022 Net Interest Margin - Net interest margin equals tax-equivalent net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets. \n \u2022 Noninterest Income - Noninterest income is the income we earn from fee-based revenues, investment in bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") and other income, and non-operating revenues. \n \u2022 Noninterest Expense - Noninterest expense is the expense we incur to operate the Company, which includes salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment, professional services, and other costs. \n \u2022 Asset Quality - Asset quality represents an estimation of the quality of our loan portfolio, including an assessment of the credit risk related to existing and potential loss exposure, and can be evaluated using a number of quantitative measures, such as non-performing loans to total loans. \n \u2022 Regulatory Capital - Our regulatory capital is classified in one of the following tiers: (i) Common Equity Tier 1 capital (\"CET1\"), which consists of common equity and retained earnings, less goodwill and other intangible assets and a portion of disallowed deferred tax assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital, which consists of CET1 and qualifying trust-preferred securities and the remaining portion of disallowed deferred tax assets, and (iii) Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses, subject to limitations.  Some of these metrics may be presented on a non-GAAP basis. For detail on our non-GAAP measures, see the discussion in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" Unless otherwise stated, all earnings per common share data included in this section and throughout the remainder of this discussion are presented on a fully diluted basis.\nA quarterly summary of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is included in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Quarterly Earnings.\"\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank each had total assets of over $14.0 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies and banks with $10.0 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As a general matter, these requirements are phased-in and become applicable to the Company and the Bank over various dates. For a discussion of the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations have on the Company and the Bank now that they have each exceeded $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, see the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section in Item 1 \"Business\" and Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K may contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"probable,\" \"potential,\" \"possible,\" \"target,\" \"continue,\" \"look forward,\" or \"assume,\" and words of similar import. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead express only management's beliefs regarding future results or events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of management's control. It is possible that actual results and events may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results or events indicated in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes, and we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect new information or events or conditions after the date hereof.\nForward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial performance, the performance of our loan or securities portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves or charge-offs, corporate strategies or objectives, including the impact of strategic actions and initiatives, anticipated trends in our business, regulatory developments, the impact of federal income tax reform legislation, acquisition transactions, including estimated synergies, cost savings and financial benefits of consummated transactions, and growth strategies, including possible future acquisitions. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. These risks, uncertainties, and assumptions include, among other things, the following:\n \u2022 Management's ability to reduce and effectively manage interest rate risk and the impact of interest rates in general on the volatility of our net interest income. \n \u2022 Asset and liability matching risks and liquidity risks. \n \u2022 Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities. \n \u2022 The ability to attract and retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services. \n \u2022 The sufficiency of the allowance for credit losses to absorb the amount of actual losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The models and assumptions underlying the establishment of the allowance for credit losses and estimation of values of collateral and various financial assets and liabilities may be inadequate. \n \u2022 Credit risks and risks from concentrations (by geographic area and by industry) within our loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds, and other financial institutions operating in our markets or elsewhere providing similar services. \n \u2022 Changes in the economic environment, competition, or other factors that may influence the anticipated growth rate of loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio, and loan and deposit pricing. \n \u2022 Changes in general economic or industry conditions, nationally or in the communities in which we conduct business. \n \u2022 Volatility of rate sensitive deposits. \n \u2022 Our ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to compete effectively in the marketplace. \n \u2022 Operational risks, including data processing system failures, fraud, or breaches. \n \u2022 Our ability to successfully pursue acquisition and expansion strategies and integrate any acquired companies. \n \u2022 The impact of liabilities arising from legal or administrative proceedings, enforcement of bank regulations, and enactment or application of laws or regulations. \n \u2022 Governmental monetary and fiscal policies and legislative and regulatory changes (including those implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act) that may result in the imposition of costs and constraints through higher FDIC insurance premiums, significant fluctuations in market interest rates, increases in capital or liquidity requirements, operational limitations, or compliance costs. \n \u2022 Changes in federal and state tax laws or interpretations, including changes affecting tax rates, income not subject to tax under existing law and interpretations, income sourcing, or consolidation/combination rules. \n \u2022 Changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines affecting the businesses we conduct. \n \u2022 Acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, and other external events. \n \u2022 Other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, products, services, and prices. \nFor a further discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should refer to the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A in this report, this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our subsequent filings made with the SEC. However, these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report describe additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nSIGNIFICANT RECENT EVENTS\nAcquisitions\nStandard Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 6, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Standard. With the acquisition, the Company acquired 35 banking offices located primarily in the southwest Chicago suburbs and adjacent markets in northwest Indiana, and added approximately $2.0 billion in deposits and $1.8 billion in loans. The merger consideration totaled $580.7 million and consisted of $533.6 million in Company common stock and $47.1 million in cash. All operating systems were converted during the first quarter of 2017.\nPremier Asset Management LLC\nOn February 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Premier, a registered investment advisor based in Chicago, Illinois. At the close of the acquisition, the Company acquired approximately $550.0 million of trust assets under management.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"federal income tax reform\") was enacted into law. This federal income tax reform, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\"), expanded investments in its colleagues and communities, and took certain actions related to its securities portfolio as follows:\n \u2022 Revalued its DTAs by $27 million, which was recorded as additional income tax expense in the Company's statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 Increased its minimum pay rate to $15 for hourly colleagues, effective in 2018. \n \u2022 Paid a special bonus of up to $1,035 to nearly 85% of colleagues. The aggregate amount of these bonuses was approximately $2 million on a pre-tax basis for the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 Contributed approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation, which supports charitable organizations in the communities the Company serves. \n \u2022 Liquidated all of its $46 million in trust-preferred collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\") at a minimal loss of approximately $800,000 late in the fourth quarter of 2017. This action improved the Company's total capital to risk-weighted assets by approximately 20 basis points. \n \u2022 Sold $150 million of collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") and other mortgage-backed securities (\"MBSs\") late in the fourth quarter of 2017 at a loss of approximately $5 million in order to invest the proceeds in higher-yielding securities with similar durations. \nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nTable 1\nSelected Financial Data\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n\n (1) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \n (2) Adjustments to net income include the revaluation of DTAs (2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (2017), a special bonus to colleagues (2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (all periods presented), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), a net gain on sale-leaseback transaction (2016), and property valuation adjustments (2015). For additional discussion of adjustments, see the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations\" section. \n (3) See the section of this Item 7 titled \"Earnings Performance\" below for additional discussion and calculation of this metric. \n\n (1) Purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") loans with an accretable yield are considered current and are not included in past due loan totals. \n (2) This ratio includes acquired loans that are recorded at fair value through an acquisition adjustment, which incorporates credit risk as of the acquisition date with no allowance for credit losses being established at that time. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. A discussion of the allowance for acquired loan losses and the related acquisition adjustment is presented in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality.\" \n (3) The allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Performance Overview for 2017 Compared with 2016\nNet income for 2017 was $98.4 million, or $0.96 per share, compared to net income of $92.3 million, or $1.14 per share, for 2016. Performance for 2017 and 2016 was impacted by certain significant transactions, which include: revaluation of DTAs related to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates (2017), a special bonus to colleagues (2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (both 2017 and 2016), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), and a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction (2016). Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share was $1.35 for 2017 and $1.22 for 2016. The increase in net income and earnings per share reflects the benefit of the Standard and Premier acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the full year impact of the NI Bancshares acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2016, organic loan growth, and increases in fee-based revenues, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.87% for 2017 compared to 3.60% for 2016, driven primarily by an increase in acquired loan accretion, higher rates, and the additional portfolio of higher-yielding fixed rate loans acquired in the Standard transaction, partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio and the continued shift of loan originations and mix to lower-yielding floating rate loans.\nTotal noninterest income was $163.1 million for 2017 compared to $159.3 million for 2016. Total fee-based revenues increased by 6.9% for 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to services provided to customers acquired in the Standard and Premier transactions and organic growth in wealth management and treasury management services, partly offset by lower card-based fees.\nTotal noninterest expense was $415.9 million for 2017, increasing by 22.5% compared to 2016. This increase is primarily the result of operating costs associated with the Standard and Premier transactions and compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nA detailed discussion of net interest income and noninterest income and expense is presented in the following section of this Item 7 titled \"Earnings Performance\" below.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, down 1.8%, from December 31, 2016. For a detailed discussion of our securities portfolio, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Investment Portfolio Management\" below.\nTotal loans of $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 reflects growth of $2.2 billion, or 26.5%, from December 31, 2016. This growth was driven primarily by loans acquired in the Standard transaction and sales production of the corporate and consumer lending teams.\nNon-performing assets represented 0.89% of total loans plus OREO as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.12% as of December 31, 2016 and 0.88% as of December 31, 2015.\nFor a detailed discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\" below.\nTotal average funding sources of $11.9 billion for 2017 increased by $2.3 billion from 2016, due primarily to the deposits assumed in the Standard acquisition. For a detailed discussion of our funding sources see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Funding and Liquidity Management\" below.\nPerformance Overview for 2016 Compared with 2015\nNet income for 2016 was $92.3 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to $82.1 million, or $1.05 per share, for 2015. Performance for 2016 and 2015 was impacted by certain significant transactions: acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (both 2016 and 2015), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction (2016), and property valuation adjustments related to strategic branch initiatives (2015). Excluding these certain significant transactions, earnings per share was $1.22 for 2016 and $1.13 for 2015. The increase in net income and earnings per share reflects the benefit of the Peoples acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the NI Bancshares acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2016, organic loan growth, and increases in fee-based revenues, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and provision for loan losses.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% for 2016 compared to 3.68% for 2015, driven primarily by organic growth in floating rate loans, lower acquired loan accretion, and the addition of FHLB advances, partially offset by the reinvestment of other interest-earning assets into higher-yielding securities.\nTotal noninterest income was $159.3 million for 2016 compared to $136.6 million for 2015. Total fee-based revenues increased by 14.0% for 2016 compared to 2015, driven mainly by services provided to customers added in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions and continued growth in mortgage banking and capital market products income.\nTotal noninterest expense was $339.5 million for 2016, increasing by 10.5% compared to 2015. Excluding certain significant transactions, total noninterest expense was $324.2 million for 2016, increasing by $27.0 million, or 9.1%, from 2015. This increase is primarily the result of operating costs associated with the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions and compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nAs of December 31, 2016 our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, rising $612.8 million, or 46.9%, from December 31, 2015. Growth for 2016 reflects purchases of certain securities and $125.8 million in securities acquired in the NI Bancshares acquisition.\nTotal loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 reflects growth of $1.1 billion, or 15.3%, from December 31, 2015. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales production of the corporate and consumer lending teams and the acquisition of NI Bancshares, which represents $279.7 million of loans at December 31, 2016.\nNon-performing assets represented 1.12% of total loans plus OREO as of December 31, 2016 compared to 0.88% as of December 31, 2015.\nTotal average funding sources of $9.5 billion for 2016 increased by $1.1 billion from 2015, due primarily to the deposits assumed in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions and the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances.\nEARNINGS PERFORMANCE\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue and is impacted by interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The accounting policies for the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are presented in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and net interest margin have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt loans and securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets. The effect of this adjustment is shown at the bottom of Table 2. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, they should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"\nTable 2 summarizes our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the related interest income and interest expense for each earning asset category and funding source, and the average interest rates earned and paid. Table 3 details differences in interest income and expense from prior years and the extent to which any changes are attributable to volume and rate fluctuations.\nTable 2\nNet Interest Income and Margin Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded in income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income. For a discussion of tax-equivalent net interest income/margin, net interest income (GAAP), and tax-equivalent net interest income/margin, adjusted, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \n (2) Non-accrual loans, which totaled $66.9 million as of December 31, 2017, $59.3 million as of December 31, 2016, and $29.4 million as of December 31, 2015, are included in loans for purposes of this analysis. Additional detail regarding non-accrual loans is presented in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-Performing Assets and Performing Potential Problem Loans.\" \n2017 Compared to 2016\nNet interest income was $472.0 million for 2017 compared to $349.7 million for 2016, an increase of 35.0%. This increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of interest-earning assets and acquired loan accretion from the Standard transaction early in the first quarter of 2017, organic loan growth, and higher interest rates.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $33.9 million and $14.6 million to net interest income for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.87% for 2017, increasing by 27 basis points from 2016. The rise in tax-equivalent net interest margin was driven primarily by a 13 basis point increase in acquired loan accretion combined with the positive impact of higher interest rates. In addition, the impact of adding a portfolio of higher-yielding fixed-rate loans acquired from Standard contributed to the increase, partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio and the continued shift of loan originations and mix to lower-yielding floating rate loans.\nTotal average interest-earning assets were $12.4 billion for 2017, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 24.8%, from 2016. The increase resulted from interest-earning assets acquired in the Standard transaction, loan growth, and security purchases. In addition, interest-earning assets acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the increase.\nTotal average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.5 billion to $8.3 billion for 2017 from $6.8 billion for 2016. The increase resulted primarily from deposits acquired in the Standard transaction and the addition of FHLB advances during 2017. Deposits acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction also contributed to the increase.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTax-equivalent net interest income was $358.3 million for 2016 compared to $322.3 million for 2015, an increase of 11.2%. This increase was driven primarily by organic loan growth, the acquisition of interest-earning assets from the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 and the Peoples transaction late in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the redeployment of other interest-earning assets into securities, partially offset by higher borrowed funds costs from the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances during 2016.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $14.6 million and $16.3 million to net interest income for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% for 2016, decreasing 8 basis points from 2015. The decline was due primarily to organic growth in floating rate loans, lower acquired loan accretion, and the addition of FHLB advances, partially offset by the reinvestment of other interest-earning assets into higher-yielding securities.\nTotal average interest-earning assets were $10.0 billion for 2016, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 13.5%, from 2015, which reflects organic loan growth and security purchases, as well as $528.8 million of interest-earning assets acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction and $96.2 million of interest-earning assets acquired in the Peoples transaction.\nCompared to 2015, total average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $860.3 million, or 14.4%, during 2016. The increase resulted primarily from deposits acquired in the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions and the addition of FHLB advances during 2016.\nTable 3\nChanges in Net Interest Income Applicable to Volumes and Interest Rates (1)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) For purposes of this table, changes which are not due solely to volume changes or rate changes are allocated to each category on the basis of the percentage relationship of each to the sum of the two. \n (2) Interest income and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \nNoninterest Income\nA summary of noninterest income for the three years ended December 31, 2017 is presented in the following table.\nTable 4\nNoninterest Income Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) Card-based fees consist of debit and credit card interchange fees for processing transactions as well as various fees on both customer and non-customer ATM and point-of-sale transactions processed through the ATM and point-of-sale networks. The related cardholder expenses are included in noninterest expense for each period presented. \n (2) Merchant servicing fees are included in other service charges, commissions, and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The related merchant card expense is included in noninterest expense for each period presented. \n (3) For a discussion of this item, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Investment Portfolio Management.\" \n (4) Other income consists primarily of safe deposit box rentals, miscellaneous recoveries, and gains on the sales of various assets.  2017 Compared to 2016\nTotal fee-based revenues were $155.2 million, rising by 6.9% compared to 2016. Excluding the negative $6.3 million impact to card-based fees due to the reduction in interchange revenue as the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (\"Durbin\") became effective in the second half of 2017, total fee-based revenues increased by 11.3% from 2016. Fee-based revenues were positively impacted by services provided to customers acquired in the Standard and Premier transactions completed in the first quarter of 2017 and organic growth in wealth management and treasury management services. Assets under management grew to $10.7 billion, a rise of $2.1 billion, or 24.1%, from 2016, driven primarily by organic growth and the addition of $863.4 million in trust assets under management from the Standard and Premier transactions, which contributed approximately $5.6 million to wealth management fees during 2017. In addition, the full year impact of customers acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction late in the first quarter of 2016 contributed to the increase in fee-based revenues compared to 2016.\nThe decline in merchant servicing fees reflected lower customer volumes, offset by the decline in merchant card expense included in noninterest expense. The decline in capital market products income compared to 2016 was in-line with lower origination volumes compared to the same period.\nMortgage banking income during 2017 resulted from sales of $252.7 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market compared to sales of $283.3 million during 2016. In addition, mortgage banking income for 2017 was negatively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from year to year.\nBOLI income for 2017 was positively impacted by benefit settlements.\nNet securities losses of $1.9 million were recognized during 2017 in connection with gains from the strategic repositioning of the securities portfolio in the third quarter, which were more than offset by losses in the fourth quarter due to certain actions taken in light of federal income tax reform.\nDuring 2016, the Company completed a sale-leaseback transaction of 55 branches that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $88.0 million, net of transaction related expenses, of which $5.5 million was immediately recognized and the remaining $82.5 million was\ndeferred and will be accreted over future periods. Accretion related to the deferred gain was $5.9 million and $1.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in net occupancy and equipment expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal noninterest income was $159.3 million for 2016, increasing by 16.6% from 2015. Total fee-based revenues were $145.1 million, rising by 14.0% compared to 2015, reflecting growth across all categories. Approximately one-third of the increase in fee-based revenues was driven by services provided to customers acquired in the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions. In addition, card-based fees increased as a result of higher transaction volumes and capital market products income grew due to higher sales to commercial clients.\nThe increase in mortgage banking income during 2016 was due primarily to sales of $283.3 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market compared to sales of $180.0 million during 2015. In addition, mortgage banking income for 2016 was positively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from year to year.\nAssets under management grew to $8.6 billion, a rise of $1.2 billion, or 15.7%, from 2015, driven primarily by the addition of $700.0 million in trust assets under management from the NI Bancshares transaction, which contributed approximately $4.0 million to wealth management fees during 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nA summary of noninterest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2017 is presented in the following table.\nTable 5\nNoninterest Expense Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) The related merchant servicing fees are included in noninterest income for each period presented. \n (2) The related card-based fees are included in noninterest income for each period presented.  2017 Compared to 2016\nTotal noninterest expense for 2017 increased by 22.5% compared to 2016. Salaries and wages and advertising and promotions expense were impacted by the special bonus and charitable contribution in connection with federal income tax reform in 2017. In addition, both periods were impacted by acquisition and integration related expenses and 2016 was impacted by a lease cancellation fee as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation. Excluding these items, total noninterest expense increased to $392.3 million, up 21.0% compared to $324.2 million in 2016. Operating costs associated with the Standard and Premier transactions, which impacted most categories, drove the increase in total noninterest expense from 2016.\nThe increase in salaries and wages was also impacted by merit increases and investments in additional talent to support growth. Higher loan remediation expenses and certain costs associated with organizational growth contributed to the rise in professional services. Net OREO expense increased due to higher valuation adjustments and operating expenses, partially offset by net gains on sales of OREO properties.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal noninterest expense for 2016 increased by 10.5% compared to 2015. For both years, total noninterest expense was impacted by certain significant transactions: acquisition and integration related expenses (both 2016 and 2015), the lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (2016), and property valuation adjustments related to strategic branch initiatives (2015). Excluding these adjustments, total noninterest expense was $324.2 million for 2016, increasing by $27.0 million, or 9.1%, from 2015. Operating costs associated with the NI Bancshares and Peoples transactions drove the increase in total noninterest expense from 2015. These costs occurred primarily within salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expense, advertising and promotions, and other expenses. In addition, the increase in salaries and wages for 2016 was impacted by compensation costs associated with merit increases and investments in additional talent to support organizational growth.\nNet OREO expense for 2016 decreased by 42.7% compared to 2015 due to reduced valuation adjustments and lower operating expenses, partially offset by net losses on sales of OREO properties realized during 2016.\nCompared to 2015, the increase in professional services and a portion of the rise in other expenses resulted from organizational growth needs for 2016. In addition, higher loan remediation expenses and vendor commissions related to the origination of equipment finance loans contributed to the increase in professional services from 2015.\nProperty valuation adjustments of $8.6 million were recognized during 2015 on twelve closed branches and seven parcels of land as part of the Company's strategic branch initiatives.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense. An analysis of the provision for income taxes is detailed in the following table.\nTable 6\nIncome Tax Expense Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) This is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of revaluations of DTAs related to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates for 2017. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Federal income tax expense and the related effective income tax rate are influenced by the amount of tax-exempt income derived from investment securities and BOLI in relation to pre-tax income as well as state income taxes. State income tax expense and the related effective income tax rate are driven by the amount of state tax-exempt income in relation to pre-tax income and state tax rules related to consolidated/combined reporting and sourcing of income and expense.\nFederal income tax reform was enacted on December 22, 2017. Among other things, the new law (i) establishes a new, flat corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21%, (ii) eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows the use of any such carryforwards to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, (iii) limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by U.S. corporations, (iv) allows businesses to immediately expense, for tax purposes, the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets, (v) eliminates or reduces certain deductions related to meals and entertainment expenses, (vi) modifies the\nlimitation on excessive employee remuneration to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation and clarifies the definition of a covered employee, and (vii) limits the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums. Federal income tax reform also significantly changes U.S. tax law related to foreign operations, however, such changes do not currently impact the Company.\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was impacted by the downward revaluation of DTAs by $26.6 million in the fourth quarter due to federal income tax reform as well as a $2.8 million benefit in the third quarter as a result of changes in Illinois income tax rates. Excluding these items, the Company's effective income tax rate was 35.0% for 2017 compared to 33.3% for 2016, up due to a rise in income subject to tax at statutory rates and increases in state statutory rates. The increases in income tax expense and the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 were due primarily to a rise in income subject to tax at statutory rates, partially offset by decreases in state statutory rates.\nOur accounting policies regarding the recognition of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Income are described in Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Portfolio Management\nSecurities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as securities held-to-maturity and are accounted for using historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Trading securities are carried at fair value and consist of securities held in a grantor trust for our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and are not considered part of the traditional investment portfolio. All other securities are classified as securities available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nWe manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, to meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income.\nFrom time to time, we adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio based on a number of factors, including expected loan growth, anticipated changes in collateralized public funds on account, the interest rate environment, and the related value of various segments of the securities markets. The following table provides a summary of our investment portfolio.\nTable 7\nInvestment Portfolio\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nPortfolio Composition\nAs of December 31, 2017, our securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, decreasing by $35.2 million, or 1.8%, from December 31, 2016, following a 46.9% increase from December 31, 2015. The decrease from December 31, 2016 was driven by securities sales of $629.8 million and $349.4 million of maturities, calls, and prepayments, partially offset by purchases of $733.4 million, consisting primarily of CMOs and MBSs. Purchase and sale activity during 2017 was driven primarily by the opportunistic repositioning of the securities portfolio in light of market conditions in the second half of the year as well as strategic actions in connection with federal income tax reform. The proceeds from sales of securities were reinvested in higher-yielding securities with similar durations. For additional detail regarding sales of securities, see the \"Realized Losses and Gains\" section of this Item 7 below.\nInvestments in municipal securities consist of general obligations of local municipalities in various states. Our municipal securities portfolio has historically experienced very low default rates and provides a predictable cash flow.\nThe following table presents the effective duration, average life, and yield to maturity for the Company's securities portfolio by category as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 8\nSecurities Effective Duration Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nN/M - Not meaningful.\n (1) The effective duration represents the estimated percentage change in the fair value of the securities portfolio given a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. This measure is used to evaluate the portfolio's price volatility at a single point in time and is not intended to be a precise predictor of future fair values since those values will be influenced by a number of factors. \n (2) Average life is presented in years and represents the weighted-average time to receive half of all expected future cash flows using the dollar amount of principal paydowns, including estimated principal prepayments, as the weighting factor. \n (3) Yields on municipal securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%.  Effective Duration\nThe average life and effective duration of our securities available-for-sale portfolio were 4.51 years and 3.38%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, compared to 4.27 and 3.72% as of December 31, 2016. The increase in average life and decrease in effective duration resulted from maturities and sales of securities that were reinvested in higher-yielding, lower-duration CMOs and MBSs.\nRealized Losses and Gains\nThere were $1.9 million of net securities losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 on securities with carrying values of $631.7 million. Net securities losses for 2017 were driven primarily by the opportunistic repositioning of the securities portfolio in light of market conditions in the second half of the year as well as strategic actions in connection with federal income tax reform, which included the liquidation of $47.7 million of CDOs. In addition, $214.1 million of securities were acquired in the Standard transaction during the first quarter of 2017, of which $210.2 million were sold shortly after the acquisition date and resulted in no gains or losses as they were recorded at fair value upon acquisition.\nNet securities gains of $1.4 million for 2016 resulted from the sale of municipal securities at gains of $1.1 million, and sales of MBSs and CMOs at net gains of $304,000.\nNet securities gains of $2.4 million for 2015 resulted from the sale of MBSs at gains of $1.9 million, and sales of CMOs, municipal securities, and other investments at net gains of $521,000.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nUnrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio. These amounts are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss on an after-tax basis. This balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change and affect the aggregate fair value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, net unrealized losses totaled $23.6 million compared to net unrealized losses of $38.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease is due primarily to the sale of CDOs in 2017, which had unrealized losses of $14.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nNet unrealized losses in the CMO portfolio totaled $17.8 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $16.7 million as of December 31, 2016. CMOs are either backed by U.S. government-owned agencies or issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. We do not believe any individual unrealized loss on these securities as of December 31, 2017 represents OTTI related to credit deterioration. In addition, we do not intend to sell the CMOs with unrealized losses and we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. For additional discussion of unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, see Note 4 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 9\nRepricing Distribution and Portfolio Yields\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nN/M - Not meaningful.\n (1) Based on amortized cost. \n (2) The repricing distributions and yields to maturity of CMOs and MBSs are based on estimated future cash flows and prepayment assumptions. Actual repricings and yields of the securities may differ from those reflected in the table depending on actual interest rates and prepayment speeds. \n (3) Yields on municipal securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The maturity date of bonds is based on contractual maturity, unless the bond, based on current market prices, is deemed to have a high probability that the call will be exercised, in which case the call date is used as the maturity date. \n (4) Yields on equity securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. Maturity dates are based on contractual maturity or repricing characteristics. \nLOAN PORTFOLIO AND CREDIT QUALITY\nOur principal source of revenue is generated by our lending activities and is composed primarily of interest income as well as loan origination and commitment fees (net of related costs). The accounting policies for the recording of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the recognition and/or deferral of interest income and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income are included in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur loan portfolio is comprised of both corporate and consumer loans with corporate loans representing 81.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. Consistent with our emphasis on relationship banking, the majority of our corporate loans are made to our core, multi-relationship customers. The customers usually maintain deposit relationships and utilize our other banking services, such as treasury or wealth management services.\nTo maximize loan income with an acceptable level of risk, we have certain lending policies and procedures that management reviews on a regular basis. In addition, management receives periodic reporting related to loan production, loan quality, credit concentrations, loan delinquencies, and non-performing and corporate performing potential problem loans to monitor and mitigate potential and current risks in the portfolio.\nTable 10\nLoan Portfolio\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) \n2017 Compared to 2016\nTotal loans of $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 reflect growth of $2.2 billion, or 26.5%, from December 31, 2016. Excluding loans related to customers and locations acquired in the Standard transaction, total loans grew by approximately 7% from December 31, 2016. Growth in commercial and industrial loans, primarily within our sector-based lending businesses and multi-family loans, contributed to the increase in total corporate loans. Total loans were also impacted by the addition of 1-4 family mortgages, installment loans, and shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal loans of $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 reflect growth of $1.1 billion, or 15.3%, from December 31, 2015 including loans acquired in the NI Bancshares transaction of $279.7 million, or 11.3%, excluding these acquired loans. Growth in commercial and industrial loans resulted primarily from broad-based increases within our middle market and sector-based lending business units. Office, retail, and industrial and multi-family loans increased compared to December 31, 2015 due to organic growth. The rise in construction loans compared to the same period was driven primarily by select commercial projects for which permanent\nfinancing is expected upon their completion. The rise in consumer loans compared to December 31, 2015 resulted from the continued expansion of mortgage and installment loans and the addition of shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans.\nComparisons of Prior Years (2015, 2014, and 2013)\nTotal loans of $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 reflect growth of $424.9 million, or 6.3%, from December 31, 2014. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales production of the corporate lending teams and growth in consumer loans. In addition, the Peoples acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 contributed $53.9 million in loans. Growth in corporate loans was concentrated within our commercial and industrial loan category, reflective of the continued expansion into sector-based lending areas. The overall decline in commercial real estate loans from December 31, 2014 resulted from the decision of certain customers to opportunistically sell their commercial businesses and investment real estate properties or use excess liquidity to payoff long-term debt. These decreases more than offset organic commercial real estate growth. Consumer loans totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and increased $227.9 million, or 24.0%, from December 31, 2014. This growth reflects the addition of shorter-duration, floating rate home equity loans, and growth in 1-4 family mortgages.\nTotal loans of $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 reflected growth of $1.0 billion, or 17.9%, from December 31, 2013. Excluding loans acquired in the Popular and Great Lakes transactions of $718.3 million, total loans grew $304.2 million from December 31, 2013. Solid performance from our legacy sales platform concentrated within our commercial and industrial, agricultural, and multi-family loan categories reflected the continued impact of greater resource investments and expansion into sector-based lending areas. Excluding loans acquired in the Popular and Great Lakes transactions of $93.5 million, consumer loans increased $60.0 million, or 7.5%, which reflects the addition of shorter-duration home equity loans.\nCommercial, Industrial, and Agricultural Loans\nCommercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represent 37.9% of total loans, and totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $743.6 million, or 23.1%, from December 31, 2016. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans generally located in the Chicago metropolitan area with purposes that include supporting seasonal working capital needs, accounts receivable financing, inventory and equipment financing, and select sector-based lending, such as healthcare, asset-based lending, structured finance, and syndications. Our commercial and industrial portfolio does not have significant direct exposure to the oil and gas industry. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory. The underlying collateral securing commercial and industrial loans may fluctuate in value due to the success of the business or economic conditions. For loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for repayment and economic conditions may impact the cash flow of the borrower. Accordingly, the underwriting for these loans is based primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower and may incorporate a personal guarantee.\nAgricultural loans are generally provided to meet seasonal production, equipment, and farm real estate borrowing needs of individual and corporate crop and livestock producers. Seasonal crop production loans are repaid by the liquidation of the financed crop that is typically covered by crop insurance. Equipment and real estate term loans are repaid through cash flows of the farming operation. Risks uniquely inherent in agricultural loans relate to weather conditions, agricultural product pricing, and loss of crops or livestock due to disease or other factors. Therefore, as part of the underwriting process, the Company examines projected future cash flows, financial statement stability, and the value of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans. The repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. This category of loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market. In addition, many commercial real estate loans do not fully amortize over the term of the loan, but have balloon payments due at maturity. The borrower's ability to make a balloon payment may depend on the availability of long-term financing or their ability to complete a timely sale of the underlying property. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on cash flow, collateral, geography, and risk rating criteria.\nConstruction loans are generally made based on estimates of costs and values associated with the completed projects and are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analyses of absorption and lease rates, and financial analyses of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment may be permanent long-term financing, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment until permanent financing is obtained. Generally, construction loans have a higher risk profile than other real estate loans since repayment is impacted by real estate values, interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, demand and supply of alternative real estate, the availability of long-term financing, and changes in general economic conditions.\nThe following table provides commercial real estate loan detail as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nTable 11\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nCommercial real estate loans represent 43.7% of total loans and totaled $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2017, increasing by $926.5 million, or 25.5%, from December 31, 2016.\nThe mix of properties securing the loans in our commercial real estate portfolio is balanced between owner-occupied and investor categories and is diverse in terms of type and geographic location, generally within the Company's markets. Approximately 43% of the commercial real estate portfolio, excluding multi-family and construction loans, is owner-occupied as of December 31, 2017. Using outstanding loan balances, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total capital was 213% and construction loans to total capital was 28% as of December 31, 2017. Non-owner-occupied (investor) commercial real estate is calculated in accordance with federal banking agency guidelines and includes construction, multi-family, non-farm non-residential property, and commercial real estate loans that are not secured by real estate collateral.\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer loans represent 18.4% of total loans, and totaled $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $513.5 million, or 36.4%, from December 31, 2016. Consumer loans are centrally underwritten using a credit scoring model developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\"), which employs a risk-based system to determine the probability that a borrower may default. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include loan-to-value and affordability ratios, risk-based pricing strategies, and documentation requirements. The home equity category consists mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by junior liens on owner-occupied real estate. Loan-to-value ratios on home equity loans and 1-4 family mortgages are based on the current appraised value of the collateral. Repayment for these loans is dependent on the borrower's continued financial stability, and is more likely to be impacted by adverse personal circumstances.\nMaturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Corporate Loans\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of our corporate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, For additional discussion of interest rate sensitivity, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Form 10-K.\nTable 12\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Corporate Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) \nAs of December 31, 2017, the composition of our corporate loans between fixed and floating interest rates was 39% and 61%, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the Company hedged $980.0 million of certain corporate variable rate loans using interest rate swaps through which the Company receives fixed amounts and pays variable amounts. Including the impact of these interest rate swaps, 49% of the loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans and 51% were floating rate loans as of December 31, 2017. See Note 19 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for detail regarding interest rate swaps.\nNon-performing Assets and Performing Potential Problem Loans\nThe following table presents our loan portfolio by performing and non-performing status. A discussion of our accounting policies for non-accrual loans, TDRs, and loans 90 days or more past due can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 13\nLoan Portfolio by Performing/Non-performing Status\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) PCI loans with an accretable yield are considered current. \n (2) Includes PCI loans of $763,000 and $681,000 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which no longer have an accretable yield as estimates of expected future cash flows have decreased since the acquisition date due to credit deterioration. \nThe following table provides a comparison of our non-performing assets and past due loans to prior periods.\nTable 14\nNon-performing Assets and Past Due Loans\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) \n (1) PCI loans with an accretable yield are considered current and not included in past due loan totals.  Non-performing Assets\nTotal non-performing assets represented 0.89% of total loans and OREO at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.12% and 0.88% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in non-performing assets as of December 31, 2017 was $5.3 million of OREO acquired in the Standard transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2016, non-performing assets increased by $29.7 million, or 47.1%, from December 31, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of five corporate loan relationships to non-accrual status during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2015, non-performing assets decreased by $48.0 million, or 43.2%, from December 31, 2014, due mainly to lower levels of non-accrual loans. The improvement in non-accrual loans related primarily to the final resolution of a large commercial loan relationship originally identified in the second half of 2014, for which a specific reserve was then established. In addition, lower levels of covered non-performing assets contributed to the decrease.\nNon-performing assets decreased by $56.6 million, or 33.8%, from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by the return of three TDRs totaling $20.7 million to performing status, sales of OREO properties, and a decline in 90 days or more past due loans.\nTDRs\nLoan modifications may be performed at the request of an individual borrower and may include reductions in interest rates, changes in payments, and extensions of maturity dates. We occasionally restructure loans at other than market rates or terms to enable the borrower to work through financial difficulties for a period of time, and these restructured loans remain classified as TDRs for the remaining terms of the loans. A discussion of our accounting policies for TDRs can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 15\nTDRs by Type\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) \nAs of December 31, 2017, TDRs totaled $26.3 million, increasing by $17.7 million from December 31, 2016. The increase was driven primarily by the extension of two non-accrual credits during 2017. The December 31, 2017 total includes $1.8 million in loans that are accruing interest, with the majority restructured at market terms. After a sufficient period of performance under the modified terms, the loans restructured at market rates will be reclassified to performing status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, TDRs totaled $8.6 million, increasing by $3.5 million from December 31, 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the addition of two corporate loan relationships to non-accrual TDR status.\nCorporate Performing Potential Problem Loans\nCorporate performing potential problem loans consist of special mention loans and substandard loans, excluding accruing TDRs. These loans are performing in accordance with their contractual terms, but we have concerns about the ability of the borrower to continue to comply with loan terms due to the borrower's operating or financial difficulties.\nTable 16\nCorporate Performing Potential Problem Loans\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) Loans categorized as special mention exhibit potential weaknesses that require the close attention of management since these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of repayment prospects in the future. \n (2) Loans categorized as substandard exhibit a well-defined weakness that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These loans continue to accrue interest because they are well-secured and collection of principal and interest is expected within a reasonable time. \n (3) Total corporate performing potential problem loans excludes accruing TDRs of $657,000 as of December 31, 2017 and $834,000 as of December 31, 2016. \n (4) Includes corporate PCI performing potential problem loans.  Corporate performing potential problem loans were 3.05% of corporate loans as of December 31, 2017, down from 4.36% as of December 31, 2016. The Standard acquisition added corporate performing potential problem loans that were designated as PCI. Management has specific monitoring and remediation plans associated with these loans.\nOREO\nOREO consists of properties acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. OREO was $20.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $26.1 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, total OREO includes $5.3 million that was acquired in the Standard transaction. A discussion of our accounting policies for OREO is contained in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 17\nOREO Properties by Type\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nOREO Activity\nA rollforward of OREO balances for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented in the following table.\nTable 18\nOREO Rollforward\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nMethodology for the Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments and is maintained by management at a level believed adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. Determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of current economic trends.\nAcquired loans are recorded at fair value, which incorporates credit risk, at the date of acquisition. No allowance for credit losses is recorded on the acquisition date for such loans. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. In addition, certain acquired loans that have renewed subsequent to their respective acquisition dates are no longer classified as acquired loans. Instead, they are included with our loan population that is allocated an allowance in accordance with our allowance for loan losses methodology.\nWhile management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for credit losses depends on a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, including the performance of its loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and property values, and the interpretation of loan risk ratings by regulatory authorities. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is an appropriate estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nThe accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses can be found in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAn allowance for credit losses is established on loans originated by the Bank, acquired loans, and covered loans. Additional discussion regarding acquired and covered loans can be found in Notes 1 and 6 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table provides additional details related to acquired loans, the allowance for credit losses as related to acquired loans, and the remaining acquisition adjustment associated with acquired loans as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 19\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Acquisition Adjustment\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nN/A - Not applicable.\n (1) These amounts and ratios relate to the loans acquired in completed acquisitions. \n (2) The remaining acquisition adjustment consists of $43.5 million and $31.2 million relating to PCI and non-purchased credit impaired (\"non-PCI\") loans, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, and $10.8 million and $11.8 million relating to PCI and non-PCI loans, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. \n (3) The allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Excluding acquired loans, the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.07% as of December 31, 2017. The acquisition adjustment increased by $52.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the Standard transaction. This was partially offset by acquired loan accretion, resulting in a remaining acquisition adjustment as a percent of acquired loans of 4.62% as of December 31, 2017. Acquired loans that are renewed are no longer classified as acquired loans. These loans totaled $366.0 million and $117.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in loans, excluding acquired loans, in the table above and allocated an allowance in accordance with our allowance for loan losses methodology. In addition, there is an allowance for credit losses of $2.6 million on acquired loans.\nTable 20\nAllowance for Credit Losses and\nSummary of Credit Loss Experience\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) Included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n (2) This ratio includes acquired loans that are recorded at fair value through an acquisition adjustment, which incorporates credit risk as of the acquisition date with no allowance for credit losses being established at that time. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. See the Allowance for Credit Losses and Acquisition Adjustment table above for further discussion of the allowance for acquired loan losses and the related acquisition adjustment. \n (3) The allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \nActivity in the Allowance for Credit Losses\nNet loan charge-offs to average loans declined to 0.21% for 2017 compared to 0.24% for 2016 and 0.29% for 2015. The improvement since 2013, and all other prior periods presented, reflects management's continued efforts to remediate problem credits.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased to $96.7 million as of December 31, 2017 from $87.1 million as of December 31, 2016, and $74.9 million as of December 31, 2015, driven primarily by loan growth and the impact of establishing an allowance on acquired loans. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses to total loans to 0.93% as of December 31, 2017 from 1.06% as of December 31, 2016 was due primarily to loans acquired in the Standard transaction.\nThe allowance for credit losses remained consistent at $74.9 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $74.5 million as of December 31, 2014. This stability in the allowance for credit losses reflects the sustained improvement in our non-performing loan levels and the related credit metrics.\nThe allowance for credit losses declined by 14.5% to $74.5 million as of December 31, 2014 from $87.1 million as of December 31, 2013, reflecting reductions across most categories. This decrease in the allowance for credit losses reflected continuing improvement in our non-performing loans and the related credit metrics resulting from management's ongoing credit remediation focus.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses\nTable 21\nAllocation of Allowance for Credit Losses\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) \n(1) Percentages represent total loans in each category to total loans.\nINVESTMENT IN BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE\nWe previously purchased life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors and officers and are the sole owner and beneficiary of the policies. We invested in these BOLI policies to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefit costs. Therefore, our BOLI policies are intended to be long-term investments to provide funding for long-term liabilities. We record these BOLI policies as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at each policy's respective cash surrender value (\"CSV\") with changes recorded as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2017, the CSV of BOLI assets totaled $279.9 million. Income and proceeds for BOLI policies are not subject to income taxation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 50.1% of our total BOLI portfolio is invested in general account life insurance distributed among fifteen insurance carriers, all of which carry investment grade ratings. This general account life insurance typically includes a feature guaranteeing minimum returns. The remaining 49.9% is in separate account life insurance, which is managed by third-party investment advisors under pre-determined investment guidelines. Stable value protection is a feature available for separate account life insurance policies that is designed to protect a policy's CSV from market fluctuations, within limits, on underlying investments. Our entire separate account portfolio has stable value protection purchased from a highly rated financial institution. To the extent fair values on individual contracts fall below 80% of their CSV, the CSV of the specific contracts may be reduced or the underlying assets may be transferred to short-duration investments, resulting in lower earnings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had BOLI income of $5.9 million compared to prior year BOLI income of $3.6 million.\nGOODWILL\nThe carrying amount of goodwill was $697.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and $340.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Goodwill increased by $356.7 million from December 31, 2016, which consisted of $345.3 million related to the Standard acquisition, $11.0 million related to the Premier acquisition, and a $423,000 measurement period adjustment related to finalizing the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the NI Bancshares acquisition. For additional detail regarding goodwill, see Note 9 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate a need to perform interim tests, as described in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2017, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill at October 1, 2017 and determined that goodwill was not impaired at that date and there was no indication that goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income tax expense recorded due to changes in uncertain tax positions is also described in Note 15.\nTable 22\nDeferred Tax Assets\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nManagement assessed whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the DTAs will not be realized. This assessment considered whether, in the periods of reversal, the DTAs can be realized through carryback to income in prior years, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, and future taxable income, including taxable income resulting from the application of future tax planning strategies. The assessment also considered positive and negative evidence, including pre-tax income during the current and prior two years, actual performance compared to budget, trends in non-performing assets and corporate performing potential problem loans, the Company's capital position, and any unsettled circumstances that could impact future earnings. Based on this assessment, management determined that it is more likely than not that our DTAs will be fully realized and no valuation allowance is required as of December 31, 2017.\nNet DTAs decreased in 2017 due primarily to the downward revaluation of DTAs by $26.6 million related to federal income tax reform, partly offset by a $2.8 million benefit due to changes in the Illinois income tax rates. In addition, accelerated tax gains associated with the disposition of assets resulting from the sale-leaseback transaction and securities valuation adjustments, partially offset by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards contributed to the decrease. Net DTAs increased in 2016 due primarily to accelerated tax gains associated with the disposition of assets resulting from the sale-leaseback transaction and securities valuation adjustments, partially offset by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nFUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flows as they become due. Our approach to liquidity management is to obtain funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit, withdrawal, and loan demand needs. Our liquidity policy establishes parameters to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a 12-month forward-looking period, including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the Bank's Board of Directors. The compliance plan includes an analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds and incorporates a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly. Based on these assumptions, we determine our total cash liquidity on hand and excess collateral capacity from pledging, unused federal funds purchased lines, and other unused borrowing capacity, such as FHLB advances, resulting in a calculation of our total liquidity capacity. Our total policy-directed liquidity requirement is to have funding sources available to cover 50.0% of non-collateralized, non-FDIC insured, non-maturity deposits. Based on our projections as of December 31, 2017, we expect to have liquidity capacity in excess of policy guidelines for the forward twelve-month period.\nThe liquidity needs of First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis (the \"Parent Company\") consist primarily of operating expenses, debt service payments, and dividend payments to our stockholders, which totaled $82.6 million for the year\nended December 31, 2017. The primary source of liquidity for the Parent Company is dividends from subsidiaries. The Parent Company had $48.2 million in junior subordinated debentures, $146.9 million in subordinated notes, and cash and interest-bearing deposits of $120.8 million as of December 31, 2017. On September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association providing for a $50.0 million short-term, unsecured revolving credit facility. On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into a first amendment to this credit facility, which extends the maturity to September 26, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding under the facility. The Parent Company has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt.\nTotal deposits and borrowed funds as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in Notes 10 and 11 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table provides a comparison of average funding sources over the last three years. We believe that average balances, rather than period-end balances, are more meaningful in analyzing funding sources because of the normal fluctuations that may occur on a daily or monthly basis within funding categories.\nTable 23\nFunding Sources - Average Balances\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nN/M - Not meaningful.\nAverage Funding Sources\nTotal average funding sources of $11.9 billion for 2017 increased by $2.3 billion, or 24.2%, from 2016. The rise in average core deposits resulted primarily from $1.7 billion in core deposits assumed in the Standard acquisition, as well as organic growth.\nTotal average funding sources of $9.5 billion for 2016 increased by $1.1 billion, or 12.9%, from 2015, due primarily to $91.8 million and $594.9 million of deposits assumed in the Peoples and NI Bancshares acquisitions, respectively, and the addition of $740.1 million of FHLB advances throughout 2016.\nTime Deposits\nTable 24\nMaturities of Time Deposits Greater Than $100,000\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nBorrowed Funds\nTable 25\nBorrowed Funds\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nAverage borrowed funds totaled $622.1 million, $497.6 million, and $151.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 from 2016 and in 2016 from 2015 was due primarily to higher levels of FHLB advances. The weighted-average rate on FHLB advances for the year-to-date periods was impacted by the hedging of $415.0 million and $325.0 million of FHLB advances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, using interest rate swaps through which the Company receives variable amounts and pays fixed amounts. The weighted-average interest rate paid on these interest rate swaps was 2.17% and 2.19% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For further discussion of interest rate swaps, see Note 19 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association providing for a $50.0 million short-term, unsecured revolving credit facility. On September 26, 2017, the Company entered into a first amendment to this credit facility, which extends the maturity to September 26, 2018. Advances will bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, adjusted on a monthly basis, and the Company must pay an unused facility fee equal to 0.35% per annum on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2017, no amount was outstanding under the facility.\nWe make interchangeable use of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, and federal funds purchased to supplement deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within 1 to 90 days from the transaction date.\nSenior and Subordinated Debt\nAverage senior and subordinated debt decreased by $2.6 million, or 1.3%, from 2016 to 2017 and $3.5 million, or 1.8%, from 2015 to 2016. These decreases resulted from the timing of the maturity and repayment of $38.5 million of 5.850% subordinated notes on April 1, 2016 and $115.0 million of the Company's 5.875% senior notes on November 22, 2016, which were partly offset by the issuance and sale of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% subordinated notes due 2026, issued on September 29, 2016. See Note 12 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding these transactions.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThrough our normal course of operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. These obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for our loans.\nThe following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as of December 31, 2017. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 26\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Risk, and Contingent Liabilities\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nN/M - Not meaningful.\nMANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL\nCapital Measurements\nA strong capital structure is required under applicable banking regulations and is crucial in maintaining investor confidence, accessing capital markets, and enabling us to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Our capital policy requires that the Company and the Bank maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines. It serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities and sets targeted levels of return on equity. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies. On January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital rules, a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations published by the Federal Reserve. These rules are discussed in the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section in Item 1, \"Business\" of this Form 10-K. In addition, financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital. The Company submitted its first required stress test report for the July 31, 2017 reporting date and the Bank will become subject to these stress test requirements starting with the July 31, 2018 reporting date.\nThe following table presents our consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the Federal Reserve for the Bank to be categorized as \"well-capitalized.\" We manage our capital ratios for both the Company and the Bank to consistently maintain these measurements in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum levels to be considered \"well-capitalized,\" which is the highest capital category established. All regulatory mandated ratios for characterization as \"well-capitalized\" were exceeded as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nThe tangible common equity ratios presented in the table below are capital adequacy metrics used and relied on by investors and industry analysts; however, they are non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"\nTable 27\nCapital Measurements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n\nN/A - Not applicable.\n (1) Ratios are not subject to formal Federal Reserve regulatory guidance. \n (2) Tangible common equity ratios are non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\" \nOverall, the Company's regulatory capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2016, due primarily to retained earnings and certain actions taken by management to sell all of its $47.7 million in CDOs, which received significantly higher risk-weightings for regulatory capital ratio calculation purposes. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the Standard and Premier acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Board reviews the Company's capital plan each quarter, considering the current and expected operating environment as well as evaluating various capital alternatives. For further details of the regulatory capital requirements and ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 for the Company and the Bank, see Note 18 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nThe Company maintains a Board-approved stock repurchase program by which shares of Company common stock may be repurchased. Shares repurchased, whether as part of or outside of the Board-approved program, are held as treasury stock and are available for issuance in connection with our qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, share-based compensation plans, and other general corporate purposes. We reissued 133,907 treasury shares in 2017 and 119,823 treasury shares in 2016 pursuant to these plans.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and for each of the quarters through the first quarter of 2017. The Company increased the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share for each of the quarters from the second quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 represents the 140th consecutive cash dividend paid by the Company since its inception in 1983.\nQUARTERLY EARNINGS\nTable 28\nQuarterly Earnings Performance (1)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n\n (1) All ratios are presented on an annualized basis. \n (2) These ratios are non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section of this Item 7 titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliations.\"  Quarterly earnings performance was impacted by certain significant transactions for all periods presented, which include: the downward revaluation of DTAs by $23.7 million due to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates (third and fourth quarters of 2017), certain actions related to the securities portfolio resulting in pre-tax net securities losses of $2.2 million (third and fourth quarters of 2017), a special bonus to colleagues of $1.9 million pre-tax and a charitable contribution of $1.6 million pre-tax (fourth quarter of 2017), pre-tax acquisition and integration related expenses of $384,000, $1.2 million, $18.6 million, $7.5 million, $1.2 million, $618,000, and $5.0 million (third, second and first quarters of 2017 and fourth, third, second, and first quarters of 2016, respectively), a lease cancellation fee of $950,000 pre-tax (fourth quarter of 2016), and gain on a sale-leaseback transaction of $5.5 million pre-tax (third quarter of 2016). Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share was $0.34, $0.33, $0.35, and $0.34 for the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of 2017, respectively, compared to $0.32 for each of the fourth, third, and second quarters of 2016 and $0.27 for the first quarter of 2016.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and are consistent with general practices within the banking industry. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on the best available information as of the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations. Future changes in information may impact these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which may have a material effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.\nThe most significant of our accounting policies and estimates are presented in Note 1 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, these policies provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates, assumptions, and judgments underlying those amounts, management determined that our accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, valuation of securities, income taxes, and goodwill and other intangible assets are considered to be our critical accounting estimates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans, actual loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, and other factors, all of which are susceptible to significant change. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses, while recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are established through the provision for loan losses charged to expense. The amount charged to operating expense depends on a number of factors, including historic loan growth, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-off levels, and our assessment of the allowance for loan losses. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, see Notes 1 and 7 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nValuation of Securities\nThe fair values of securities are based on quoted prices obtained from third-party pricing services or dealer market participants where a ready market for such securities exists. In the absence of quoted prices or where a market for the security does not exist, management judgment and estimation is used, which may include modeling-based techniques. The use of different judgments and estimates to determine the fair value of securities could result in a different fair value estimate.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess securities with unrealized losses to determine whether OTTI has occurred. In evaluating OTTI, management considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including external credit ratings and recent downgrades for debt securities, intent to hold the security until its value recovers, and the likelihood that the Company would be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value, which may be at maturity. The term \"other-than-temporary\" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent. It indicates that the prospects for near-term recovery are not necessarily favorable or there is a lack of evidence to support fair values greater than or equal to the carrying value of the investment. Securities for which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss and included in net securities (losses) gains, but only to the extent the impairment is related to credit deterioration. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) unless management intends to sell the security in a short period of time or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to full recovery. The determination of OTTI is subjective and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing and amount of loss realization. For additional discussion of securities, see Notes 1 and 4 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences result in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nWe assess the likelihood that any DTAs will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management makes judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning\nstrategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that DTAs included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods.\nManagement also makes certain interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of the tax position may not be certain. Uncertain tax positions are periodically evaluated and we may establish tax reserves for benefits that may not be realized. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 15 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, both intangible and tangible, be recorded at their estimated fair value upon acquisition. Determining the fair value often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Goodwill is not amortized, instead, we assess the potential for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nOther intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance, but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. The determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For additional discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 1 and 9 of \"Notes to the Consolidated financial Statements\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RECONCILIATIONS\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, adjusted, tax-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), tax-equivalent net interest margin, tax-equivalent net interest margin, adjusted, effective income tax rate, excluding revaluations of DTAs, return on average common equity, adjusted, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), to tangible assets, tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, adjusted.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, all adjusted for certain significant transactions. These transaction include the revaluation of DTAs (fourth and third quarters of 2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (fourth quarter and third quarters of 2017), a special bonus to colleagues (fourth quarter of 2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (fourth quarter of 2017), acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (all periods presented, excluding the fourth quarter of 2017), a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation (fourth quarter of 2016), a net gain on sale-leaseback transaction (third quarter of 2016), property valuation adjustments (2015), a gain on the sale of an equity investment (2013), losses on early extinguishment of debt (2013), gain on the termination of FHLB commitments (2013), adjusted amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset (2013), and a BOLI modification loss (2013). Management believes excluding these transactions from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity is useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these transactions do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion facilitates better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding acquisition and integration related expenses from these metrics is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and assumes a 35% tax rate. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. In addition, management believes that presenting tax-equivalent net interest margin, excluding the impact of acquired loan accretion, enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes and is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since acquired loan accretion income may fluctuate based on the size of each acquisition, as well as from period to period.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nThe Company presents the allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans. Management believes excluding acquired loans is useful as it facilitates better comparability between periods as these loans are recorded at fair value, which incorporates credit risk, at the date of acquisition. No allowance for credit losses is recorded on the acquisition date. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. See Table 20 in the section of this Item 7 titled \"Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\" for details on the calculation of this measure.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. See the following reconciliations for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote: Non-GAAP Reconciliation footnotes are located at the end of this section.\n\n\nNote: Non-GAAP Reconciliation footnotes are located at the end of this section.\n\n (1) Adjustments to net income for the fourth and third quarters of 2017 include revaluation of DTAs related to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates, a special colleague bonus, additional charitable contribution, and certain actions related to the securities portfolio. In addition, net income for certain periods was adjusted for acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions, a lease cancellation fee recognized as a result of the Company's planned 2018 corporate headquarters relocation, a net gain on a sale-leaseback transaction, property valuation adjustments, a gain on the sale of an equity investment, losses on early extinguishment of debt, gain on the termination of FHLB commitments, adjusted amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset, and a BOLI modification loss. \n (2) Presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. \n (3) Annualized based on the actual number of days for each period presented.
