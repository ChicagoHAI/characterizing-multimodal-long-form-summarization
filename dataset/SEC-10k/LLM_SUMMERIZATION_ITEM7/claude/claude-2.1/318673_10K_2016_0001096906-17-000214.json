Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company's operations over the last several years generally reflect three trends or events which the Company expects to continue: (i) increased attention to \"niche\" insurance products, such as the Company's funeral plan policies and traditional whole life products; (ii) emphasis on cemetery and mortuary business; and (iii) capitalizing on relatively low interest rates by originating mortgage loans.\nInsurance Operations\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's insurance operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Profitability in 2016 has decreased due to a decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets, which was partially offset by an increase in net investment income and an increase in insurance premiums.\nCemetery and Mortuary Operations\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's cemetery and mortuary operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Included in other revenue was rental income from residential and commercial properties purchased from Security National Life. Memorial Estates used financing provided by Security National Life to purchase these properties. The rental income was offset by property insurance, taxes, maintenance expenses and interest payments made to Security National Life. Memorial Estates recorded depreciation on these properties of $715,000, $858,000 and $945,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nMortgage Operations\nApproximately 64% of the Company's revenues for the fiscal year 2016 were through its wholly owned subsidiaries, SecurityNational Mortgage and EverLEND Mortgage. Both mortgage subsidiaries are mortgage lenders incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah and approved and regulated by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a department of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower, in addition to various conventional mortgage loan products. SecurityNational Mortgage and EverLEND Mortgage obtain mortgage loans originated in retail offices and through independent brokers. Mortgage loans originated by the Company's mortgage subsidiaries are funded through loan purchase agreements from Security National Life and unaffiliated financial institutions.\nThe Company's mortgage subsidiaries receive fees from the borrowers and secondary fees from third party investors that purchase their loans. Loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage are generally sold with mortgage servicing rights released to third party investors or retained by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage currently retains the mortgage servicing rights on approximately 30% of its loan origination volume. These loans are serviced by an approved third party sub-servicer.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SecurityNational Mortgage originated and sold 16,022 loans ($3,097,872,000 total volume), 14,976 loans ($2,843,455,000 total volume), and 10,794 loans ($2,037,337,000 total volume), respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, EverLEND Mortgage originated and sold three loans ($838,000 total volume), 79 loans ($17,949,000 total volume), and 33 loans ($7,298,000 total volume), respectively.\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's mortgage operations for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 14 and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years ended December 31\n(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2016 vs 2015 % Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 vs 2014 % Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues from external customers:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues from loan originations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 139,042\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,248\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secondary gains from investors\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,677\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,211\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,862\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 184,015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,253\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125,110\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,817\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,846\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,788\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in revenues for the Company's mortgage operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in mortgage loan originations and fee income from the loan originations.\nMortgage Loan Loss Settlements\nFuture loan losses can be extremely difficult to estimate. However, management believes that the Company's reserve methodology and its current practice of property preservation allow it to estimate potential losses on loans sold. The amounts expensed for loan losses in years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4,689,000 and $6,295,000, respectively. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances were $628,000 and $2,806,000, respectively.\nSettlement of Investigation by U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) of Certain FHA-Insured Mortgage Loans Originated\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SecurityNational Mortgage, announced the execution of a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office in connection with the origination and underwriting by SecurityNational Mortgage of certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured loans. SecurityNational Mortgage, like many other high volume FHA-approved lenders, was being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for loan origination activities that occurred as long as nine years ago.\nWithout any admission of liability and in order to avoid the extended distractions and expenses associated with protracted litigation, SecurityNational Mortgage made a business decision to resolve this matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, SecurityNational Mortgage was required to make a payment in the amount of $4,250,000 to the U.S. Department of Justice, which payment was made on October 4, 2016. SecurityNational Mortgage continues to be able to originate FHA-insured mortgage loans and participate fully in all FHA programs as this settlement agreement does not affect SecurityNational Mortgage's status with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In addition, this settlement does not include any allegations or findings against any particular individuals, such as officers, directors, employees or agents of SecurityNational Mortgage.\nMortgage Loan Loss Litigation\nFor a description of the litigation involving SecurityNational Mortgage and Lehman Brothers and Aurora Loan Services, reference is to Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsurance Operations\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), premiums and other considerations received for interest sensitive products are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues. Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses.\nThe Company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited. Interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements.\nPremiums and other considerations received for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due. Future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits.\nThe costs related to acquiring new business, including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses (principally commissions), defined as deferred policy acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized into expense. For nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally \"locked in\" at the date the policies are issued. For interest sensitive products, these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. This amortization is adjusted when the Company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins. For example, deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity.\nDeath and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits. The profitability of the Company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality, other policyholder benefits, expense levels, interest spreads (i.e., the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders) and persistency. The Company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting, asset and liability duration matching, sound actuarial practices, adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges.\nCemetery and Mortuary Operations\nPre-need sales of funeral services and caskets, including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need funeral services and caskets, are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered.\nPre-need sales of cemetery interment rights (cemetery burial property), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery interment rights, are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of GAAP. Under GAAP, recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected. Revenues related to the pre-need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of GAAP, described above.\nPre-need sales of cemetery merchandise (primarily markers and vaults), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered.\nPre-need sales of cemetery services (primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery services, are deferred until the services are performed.\nPrearranged funeral and pre-need cemetery customer obtaining costs, including costs incurred related to obtaining new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of GAAP related to Financial Services - Insurance. Obtaining costs, which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed.\nRevenues and costs for at-need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists, the services are performed, collection is reasonably assured, and there are no significant obligations remaining.\nMortgage Operations\nMortgage fee income consists of origination fees, processing fees and certain other income related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans. For mortgage loans sold to third party investors, mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized pursuant to GAAP at the time the sales of the mortgage loans comply with the sales criteria for the transfer of financial assets. The sales criteria are as follows: (i) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company and its creditors, (ii) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the mortgage, and (iii) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred mortgage.\nThe Company must determine that all three sales criteria are met at the time a mortgage loan is funded. All rights and title to the mortgage loans are assigned to unrelated financial institution investors, including investor commitments for the loans made prior to warehouse banks purchasing the loans under the purchase commitments.\nThe Company sells mortgage loans to third party investors without recourse. It may be required, however, to repurchase a loan or pay a fee instead of repurchase under certain events, which include the following:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Failure to deliver original documents specified by the investor,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The existence of misrepresentation or fraud in the origination of the loan,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The loan becomes delinquent due to nonpayment during the first several months after it is sold,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Early pay-off of a loan, as defined by the agreements,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Excessive time to settle a loan,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Investor declines purchase, and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Discontinued product and expired commitment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan purchase commitments generally specify a date 30 to 45 days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled. Depending on market conditions, these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to the Company.\nIt is the Company's policy to cure any documentation problems regarding such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six-month time period and to pursue efforts to enforce loan purchase commitments from third-party investors concerning the loans. The Company believes that six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues, to enforce purchase commitments, and to exhaust other alternatives. Remedial methods include the following:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Research reasons for rejection,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Provide additional documents,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Request investor exceptions,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Appeal rejection decision to purchase committee, and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Commit to secondary investors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOnce purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted, which could be earlier than the six-month time period, the loans are repurchased and transferred to the long-term investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value and the previously recorded sales revenue is reversed. Any loan that later becomes delinquent is evaluated by the Company at that time and any impairment is adjusted accordingly.\nDetermining lower of cost or market. Cost is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by the Company. Market value, while often difficult to determine, is based on the following guidelines:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> For loans that have an active market, the Company uses the market price on the repurchase date.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> For loans where there is no market but there is a similar product, the Company uses the market value for the similar product on the repurchase date.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> For loans where no active market exists on the repurchase date, the Company determines that the unpaid principal balance best approximates the market value on the repurchase date, after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and estimated future cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds significance to the Company's determination of fair value because, if the loan becomes delinquent, the Company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value of the loan. In determining the market value on the date of repurchase, the Company considers the total value of all of the loans because any sale of loans would be made as a pool.\nLoans that have been foreclosed are reclassified as real estate held for investment. The Company carries the foreclosed properties in either Security National Life, Memorial Estates, or SecurityNational Mortgage and rents the properties until it is deemed economically desirable to sell them.\nThe majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors. The amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as mortgage loans sold to investors, and include the fees due from the investors.\nUse of Significant Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates, and critical issues that impact them:\nLoan Commitments\nThe Company estimates the fair value of a mortgage loan commitment based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, quoted MBS prices, estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and an estimate of the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the commitment net of estimated commission expense. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the mortgage loan commitment is issued and is shown net of related expenses. Following issuance, the value of a loan commitment can be either positive or negative depending upon the change in value of the underlying mortgage loans. Fallout rates and other factors from the Company's recent historical data are used to estimate the quantity and value of mortgage loans that will fund within the terms of the commitments.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following: yield on investments supporting the liabilities, amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies, amount of policy fees and charges, amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies, amount of death and surrender benefits, and the length of time the policies will stay in force.\nFor nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally \"locked in\" at the date the policies are issued.\nValue of Business Acquired\nValue of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs. The critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired.\nMortgage Loans Foreclosed to Real Estate Held for Investment\nThese properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon foreclosure. The Company believes that in an orderly market fair value will approximate the replacement cost of a home and the rental income provides a cash flow stream for investment analysis. The Company believes the highest and best use of the properties are as income producing assets since it is the Company's intent to hold the properties as rental properties, matching the income from the investment in rental properties with the funds required for future estimated policy claims. Accordingly, the fair value determination will be weighted more heavily toward the rental analysis.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nReserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the policies, mortality experience, expenses, investment yield, lapse rates, surrender rates, and dividend crediting rates.\nThese assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of products, these assumptions are generally held constant.\nUnearned Revenue\nThe universal life products the Company sells have significant policy initiation fees (front-end load) that are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. The same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue.\nDeferred Pre-need Cemetery and Funeral Contracts Revenues and Estimated Future Cost of Pre-need Sales\nThe revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed.\nThe Company, through its cemetery and mortuary operations, provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices. To accomplish this, the Company, through its life insurance operations, sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries. If, at the time of need, the policyholder or potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the Company's facilities, the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price. The increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices. Risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage Service Rights (MSR) arise from contractual agreements between the Company and third-party investors (or their agents) when mortgage loans are sold. Under these contracts, the Company is obligated to retain and provide loan servicing functions on the loans sold, in exchange for fees and other remuneration. The servicing functions typically performed include, among other responsibilities, collecting and remitting loan payments; responding to borrower inquiries; accounting for principal and interest, holding custodial (impound) funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising the acquisition of real estate owned and property dispositions. The Company initially accounts for MSRs at fair value and subsequently accounts for them using the amortization method. MSR amortization is determined by amortizing the balance straight-line over an estimated seven and nine-year life. The Company periodically assesses MSRs accounted for using the amortization method for impairment.\nMortgage Allowance for Loan Loss and Loan Loss Reserve\nThe Company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses (a contra-asset account) and through the mortgage loan loss reserve (a liability account). The allowance for loan losses is an allowance for losses on the Company's mortgage loans held for investment. The allowance is comprised of two components. The first component is an allowance for collectively evaluated impairment that is based upon the Company's historical experience in collecting similar receivables. The second component is based upon individual evaluation of loans that are determined to be impaired. Upon determining impairment, the Company establishes an individual impairment allowance based upon an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nWhen a mortgage loan is past due more than 90 days, the Company, where appropriate, sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. When foreclosure is commenced on a delinquent loan, all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred. Once foreclosed the carrying value should approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate owned. The Company is currently able to rent properties at a 2% to 8% gross return.\nThe mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors. The Company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company's estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities.\nUpon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions. The Company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on total production. This estimate is based on the Company's historical experience. The amount accrued for and the charge to expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require various estimates and judgments and may be affected favorably or unfavorably by various internal and external factors. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from temporary differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and in estimating the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets recoverable in future periods. Factors affecting the deferred tax assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, and changes to overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Changes in these estimates, judgments or factors may result in an increase or decrease to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities with a related increase or decrease in the Company's provision for income taxes.\nResults of Consolidated Operations\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal revenues increased by $22,644,000, or 8.0%, to $307,208,000 for fiscal year 2016 from $284,564,000 for the fiscal year 2015. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a $10,690,000 increase in mortgage fee income, an $8,091,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a $3,574,000 increase in net investment income, a $1,766,000 increase in other revenues, a $765,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales, and a $335,000 decrease in other than temporary impairments. This increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $2,577,000 decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets.\nInsurance premiums and other considerations increased by $8,091,000, or 14.3%, to $64,501,000 for 2016, from $56,410,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in renewal premiums and an increase in first year premiums as a result of increased insurance sales in 2016.\nNet investment income increased by $3,574,000, or 10.5%, to $37,582,000 for 2016, from $34,008,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $2,961,000 increase in insurance assignment income, a $1,515,000 increase in income from real estate held for investment, a $1,267,000 increase in interest from mortgage loans, an $804,000 increase in fixed maturity securities income and a $31,000 increase in policy loans income. This increase was partially offset by a $2,610,000 decrease in income from short-term investments and a $406,000 increase in investment expenses.\nNet cemetery and mortuary sales increased by $765,000, or 6.7%, to $12,267,000 for 2016, from $11,502,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in at-need sales and pre-need sales in both the cemetery and mortuary operations.\nRealized gains on investments and other assets decreased by $2,577,000, or 107.3%, to $176,000 in realized losses for 2016, from $2,401,000 in realized gains for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets was primarily attributable to a $2,577,000 decrease in realized gains on other assets due to the sale of an office building in 2015, which was offset by an increase in impairments on real estate held for investment in 2016, and a $47,000 decrease in realized gains on fixed maturity securities. This decrease was also partially offset by a $47,000 increase in realized gains on securities available for sale.\nOther than temporary impairments on investments decreased by $335,000, or 55.3%, to $270,000 for 2016 from $605,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in impairments on fixed maturity securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.\nMortgage fee income increased by $10,690,000, or 6.1%, to $186,416,000 for 2016, from $175,726,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage loan originations.\nOther revenues increased by $1,766,000, or 34.5%, to $6,888,000 for 2016 from $5,122,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenues.\nTotal benefits and expenses were $286,468,000, or 93.2% of total revenues, for 2016, as compared to $263,339,000, or 93.0% of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2015.\nDeath benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits increased by an aggregate of $4,102,000, or 8.1%, to $54,864,000 for 2016, from $50,762,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $4,264,000 increase in future policy benefits, which was partially offset by a $125,000 decrease in death benefits and a $37,000 decrease in surrenders and other policy benefits.\nAmortization of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired increased by $2,362,000, or 41.9%, to $8,003,000 for 2016, from $5,641,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance sales expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16,028,000, or 8.0%, to $216,702,000 for 2016, from $200,674,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $9,394,000 increase in personnel expenses resulting from increased salaries for existing employees and the hiring of new employees, a $5,827,000 increase in commission expenses, a $1,616,000 increase in other expenses, a $695,000 increase in advertising expenses and a $210,000 increase in rent and rent related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1,606,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $108,000 decrease in costs related to funding mortgage loans.\nInterest expense increased by $654,000, or 14.7%, to $5,112,000 for 2016, from $4,458,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the completion of the construction of the Dry Creek at East Village Apartments development in December 2015, resulting in the interest from the bank loan that had been capitalized during the construction phase of the project being expensed in 2016.\nCost of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries decreased by $16,000, or 0.9%, to $1,787,000 for 2016, from $1,803,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortuary at-need sales, which was offset by an increase in cemetery pre-need sales.\nOther comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to a gain of $764,000 and a loss of $761,000, respectively. This increase of $1,525,000 in 2016 was primarily the result of a $1,529,000 unrealized gain in marketable securities.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues increased by $57,186,000, or 25.1%, to $284,564,000 for fiscal year 2015 from $227,379,000 for the fiscal year 2014. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a $46,588,000 increase in mortgage fee income, a $5,704,000 increase in net investment income, a $3,401,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a $1,375,000 increase in other revenues, a $483,000 increase in realized gains on investments and other assets, and a $76,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales. This increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $441,000 increase in other than temporary impairments.\nInsurance premiums and other considerations increased by $3,401,000, or 6.4%, to $56,410,000 for 2015, from $53,009,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in renewal premiums and an increase in first year premiums as a result of increased insurance sales in 2015.\nNet investment income increased by $5,704,000, or 20.2%, to $34,008,000 for 2015, from $28,304,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4,119,000 increase in income from short-term investments, a $1,021,000 increase in income from real estate, a $414,000 decrease in investment expenses, a $146,000 increase in interest from mortgage loans, a $57,000 increase in equity securities income, and an $8,000 increase in policy loans income. This increase was partially offset by a $61,000 decrease in fixed maturity securities income.\nNet cemetery and mortuary sales increased by $76,000, or 0.7%, to $11,502,000 for 2015, from $11,426,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $249,000 increase in cemetery pre-need and at-need sales. This increase was partially offset by a $173,000 decrease in mortuary at-need sales.\nRealized gains on investments and other assets increased by $483,000, or 25.2%, to $2,401,000 in realized gains for 2015, from $1,918,000 in realized gains for the comparable period in 2014. This increase in realized gains and losses on investments and other assets was primarily due to a $677,000 increase in gains and losses on other assets. This increase was partially offset by a $180,000 decrease in gains and losses on marketable securities, and a $14,000 decrease in gains and losses on fixed maturity securities held to maturity.\nOther than temporary impairments on investments increased by $441,000, or 268.6%, to $605,000 for 2015 from $164,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to a $192,000 increase in impairments on real estate held for investment and mortgage loans, and a $249,000 increase in impairments on marketable securities.\nMortgage fee income increased by $46,588,000, or 36.1%, to $175,727,000 for 2015, from $129,139,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage loan originations and higher secondary gains from mortgage loans sold to investors.\nOther revenues increased by $1,375,000, or 36.7%, to $5,122,000 for 2015 from $3,747,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenues.\nTotal benefits and expenses were $263,339,000, or 93.0% of total revenues, for 2015, as compared to $214,456,000, or 94.5% of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2014.\nDeath benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits increased by an aggregate of $2,912,000, or 6.1%, to $50,762,000 for 2015, from $47,850,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $4,058,000 in death benefits, which was partially offset by decreases of $848,000 in future policy benefits, and $298,000 in surrenders and other policy benefits.\nAmortization of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired decreased by $1,252,000, or 18.2%, to $5,641,000 for 2015, from $6,893,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to improved persistency in the payment of premiums in the traditional life business.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $45,809,000, or 29.6%, to $200,674,000 for 2015, from $154,865,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $22,059,000 increase in commission expenses, an $11,500,000 increase in personnel expenses, a $4,154,000 increase in other expenses, a $3,242,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $1,987,000 increase in costs related to funding mortgage loans, and a $1,715,000 increase in rent and rent related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1,146,000 decrease in advertising expenses. These increased expenses in 2015 were primarily due to the additional costs and expenses associated with the Company's significant increases in the number of mortgage loan originations in 2015.\nInterest expense increased by $1,464,000, or 48.9%, to $4,458,000 for 2015, from $2,994,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in outstanding balances on warehouse lines of credit that are used to fund mortgage loans.\nCost of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries decreased by $50,000, or 2.7%, to $1,803,000 for 2015, from $1,853,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortuary at-need sales, which was offset by an increase in cemetery pre-need and at-need sales.\nOther comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 amounted to losses of $761,000 and $49,000, respectively. This decrease of $712,000 in 2015 was primarily the result of a $705,000 unrealized loss in marketable securities.\nRisks\nThe following is a description of the most significant risks facing the Company and how it mitigates those risks:\nLegal and Regulatory Risks. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the Company operates may create additional expenses and risks not anticipated by the Company in developing and pricing its products. Regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits, new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the Company's mortgage sales. Also, the Company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery and mortuary business. The Company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations, thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction, and also by employing underwriting practices that identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks.\nMortgage Industry Risks. Developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets can adversely affect the Company's ability to sell its mortgage loans to investors, which can impact the Company's financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding and servicing any unsold loans.\nThe mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company could realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors. The Company's mortgage subsidiaries may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company's estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities.\nUpon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions. The amounts expensed for loan losses in years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $4,689,000, $6,295,000 and $3,053,000, respectively, and the charge to expense has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances were $628,000 and $2,806,000, respectively. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of December 31, 2016. There is a risk, however, that future loan losses may exceed the loan loss reserves and allowances.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of $3,184,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than 90 days. Of this amount, $1,829,000 of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings. The Company has not received or recognized any interest income on the $3,184,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than 90 days. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company decreased its allowance for mortgage losses by $99,000 and $31,000, respectively, which was charged to bad debt expense and included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period. The allowances for mortgage loan losses as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,749,000 and $1,848,000, respectively.\nAt various times third party investors have asserted that SecurityNational Mortgage sold mortgage loans that allegedly contained borrower misrepresentations or experienced early payment defaults, or that were otherwise allegedly defective or not in compliance with loan purchase agreements involving SecurityNational Mortgage. As a result of these claims, third party investors have made demands at times that SecurityNational Mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans.\nThe total amount of potential claims by third party investors is difficult to determine. The Company has reserved and accrued $628,000 as of December 31, 2016 to settle all such investor related claims. The Company believes that the reserve for mortgage loan losses, which includes provisions for probable losses and indemnification on mortgage loans sold to investors, is reasonable based on available information. Moreover, the Company has successfully negotiated acceptable settlement terms with other third party investors that asserted claims for mortgage loan losses against SecurityNational Mortgage.\nSecurityNational Mortgage disagrees with the repurchase demands and notices of potential claims from third party investors. Furthermore, SecurityNational Mortgage believes there is potential to resolve the alleged claims by the third-party investors on acceptable terms. If SecurityNational Mortgage is unable to resolve such claims on acceptable terms, legal action may ensue. In the event of legal action by any third-party investor, SecurityNational Mortgage believes it has significant defenses to any such action and intends to vigorously defend itself against such action.\nInterest Rate Risk. The risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the Company's investments or impair the ability of the Company to market its mortgage and cemetery/mortuary products. This change in rates may cause certain interest-sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation. The Company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non-conformance with certain policy provisions, by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser, and by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities. To the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature, the Company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale.\nMortality and Morbidity Risks. The risk that the Company's actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality and morbidity experiences may cause the Company's products to be underpriced, may cause the Company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated, and other potentially adverse consequences to the business. The Company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices, asset and liability duration matching, and sound actuarial practices.\nEstimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term are those used in determining the value of derivative assets and liabilities, those used in determining deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, those used in determining the value of mortgage loans foreclosed to real estate held for investment, those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and unearned revenue, those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre-need sales, those used in determining the value of mortgage servicing rights, those used in determining allowances for loan losses for mortgage loans on real estate, those used in determining loan loss reserve, and those used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are fairly stated in all material respects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums, contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business, from interest and dividends on invested assets, and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments. The mortgage subsidiaries realize cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors. The Company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities, which generally are long-term, and adequate to pay current policyholder claims, annuity payments, expenses related to the issuance of new policies, the maintenance of existing policies, debt service, and to meet current operating expenses.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operations provided cash of $43,860,000. This was primarily due to an increase in cash collected on mortgage loans sold to investors. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company's operations used cash of $15,831,000. This was primarily due to an increase in cash paid on mortgage loans sold to investors.\nThe Company's liability for future life, annuity and other benefits is expected to be paid out over the long-term due to the Company's market niche of selling funeral plans. Funeral plans are small face value life insurance that will pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person's death. A person generally will keep these policies in force and will not surrender them prior to a person's death. Because of the long-term nature of these liabilities, the Company is able to hold to maturity its bonds, real estate and mortgage loans thus reducing the risk of liquidating these long-term investments as a result of any sudden changes in market values.\nThe Company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities. The Company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing. The Company purchases short-term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short-term requirements of the Company's products. The Company's investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return, which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements.\nThe Company's investment policy is also to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities, real estate, mortgage loans, and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short-term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries. Bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to $184,356,000 and $144,946,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This represents 33.1% and 32.9% of the total investments as of December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Generally, all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Under this rating system, there are six categories used for rating bonds. At December 31, 2016, 9.0% (or $16,513,000) and at December 31, 2015, 8.3% (or $11,990,000) of the Company's total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six, which are considered non-investment grade.\nThe Company has classified certain of its fixed income securities, including high-yield securities, in its portfolio as available for sale, with the remainder classified as held to maturity. In accordance with Company policy, however, any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity. Notwithstanding, business conditions may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio. In that event, the Company believes it could sell short-term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer-term securities.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities and for the schedule of principal payments for mortgage loans on real estate and construction loans held for investment.\nIf market conditions were to cause interest rates to change, the market value of the Company's fixed income portfolio, which includes bonds, preferred stock, and mortgage loans, could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing (the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique):\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -200 bps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -100 bps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +100 bps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +200 bps\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Market Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,572\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,491\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,119\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (30,069\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets, liabilities, disintermediation, and business risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria.\nThe Company's total capitalization of stockholders' equity, and bank loans and notes payable were $181,898,000 as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $152,155,000 as of December 31, 2015. Stockholders' equity as a percent of total capitalization was 70.5% and 73.1% as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Bank loans and notes payable increased by $12,810,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, thus decreasing the stockholders' equity percentage.\nLapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period. The Company's lapse rate for life insurance was 9.6% in 2016 as compared to a rate of 7.4% for 2015.\nAt December 31, 2016, $44,055,000 of the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity represents the statutory stockholders' equity of the Company's life insurance subsidiaries. The life insurance subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend to its parent company without the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their businesses without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements. The Company desires to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the act.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, together with related data and projections, about the Company's projected financial results and its future plans and strategies. However, actual results and needs of the Company may vary materially from forward-looking statements and projections made from time to time by the Company on the basis of management's then-current expectations. The business in which the Company is engaged involves changing and competitive markets, which may involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements and projections will prove accurate.\nFactors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted in such forward looking statements include among others, the following possibilities: (i) heightened competition, including the intensification of price competition, the entry of new competitors, and the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors; (ii) adverse state and federal legislation or regulation, including decreases in rates, limitations on premium levels, increases in minimum capital and reserve requirements, benefit mandates and tax treatment of insurance products; (iii) fluctuations in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income or increase in interest expense and in the market value of interest rate sensitive investment; (iv) failure to obtain new customers, retain existing customers or reductions in policies in force by existing customers; (v) higher service, administrative, or general expense due to the need for additional advertising, marketing, administrative or management information systems expenditures; (vi) loss or retirement of key executives or employees; (vii) increases in medical costs; (viii) changes in the Company's liquidity due to changes in asset and liability matching; (ix) restrictions on insurance underwriting based on genetic testing and other criteria; (x) adverse changes in the ratings obtained by independent rating agencies; (xi) failure to maintain adequate reinsurance; (xii) possible claims relating to sales practices for insurance products and claim denials and (xiii) adverse trends in mortality and morbidity; (xiv) deterioration of real estate markets and (xv) lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.\nOff-Balance Sheet Agreements\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating $560,350, to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to additional risk assessments pertaining to the Company's captive insurance program. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit because claims are not expected to exceed premiums paid. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of this letter of credit is zero.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under standby letters of credit aggregating $1,250,000, to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to claims filed in states where the Company's mortgage segment is licensed. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of these standby letters of credit. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of these letters of credit is zero.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating $48,220, issued as a security deposit to guarantee payment of final bills for electric and gas utility services for a commercial real estate property owned by the Company in Wichita, Kansas. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of this letter of credit is zero.\nSecurityNational Mortgage has entered into loan purchase agreements and subsequent amendments to originate and sell mortgage loans to two unaffiliated warehouse banks. On March 19, 2012, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") entered into a loan purchase agreement in which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a warehouse line of up to $55,000,000 to fund certain approved mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage. On December 10, 2015, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo agreed to an amendment to the March 19, 2012 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $55,000,000 to $70,000,000. On June 6, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo agreed to another amendment to the March 19, 2012 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $70,000,000 to $100,000,000.\nOn August 14, 2015, SecurityNational Mortgage entered into a loan purchase agreement with Texas Capital Bank. The loan purchase agreement provides a warehouse line of up to $30,000,000 to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage is listed as seller and the Company as guarantor in the agreement. On September 7, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage and Texas Capital Bank agreed to an amendment to the August 14, 2015 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $30,000,000 to $100,000,000.\nGenerally, when mortgage loans are sold to the warehouse banks, the Company is no longer obligated to pay the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loans, but is required to pay a fee in the form of interest on the mortgage loans between the date the loans are sold to warehouse banks and the settlement date with the third-party investors. The terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year, with interest accruing on the mortgage loans at annual rates ranging from 2.5% to 2.75% over the 30-day Libor rate.\nAs of December 31, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage had $181,573,000 in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending and EverLEND Mortgage had $-0- in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending.\nThe total of the Company's unfunded residential construction loan and land development loan commitments as of December 31, 2016, was $15,622,000.\nThe Company entered into a Construction Loan Agreement between Key Bank National Association and 5300 Development LLC, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay Key Bank the current outstanding principal up to $40,740,000 plus interest. These funds are being used for the construction of phase 1 of the Company's new corporate campus development in Salt Lake City Utah. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has used $8,778,000 of these funds.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, and the payments due by period are shown in the following table:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> over\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,556,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,857,212\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 534,151\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,438\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,984,894\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank and other loans payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,755,443\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,668,543\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,502,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,791,717\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,718,548\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,311,536\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,525,755\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,036,996\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,829,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,703,442\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCasualty Insurance Program\nIn conjunction with the Company's casualty insurance program, limited equity interests are held in a captive insurance entity. This program permits the Company to self-insure a portion of losses, to gain access to a wide array of safety-related services, to pool insurance risks and resources in order to obtain more competitive pricing for administration and reinsurance and to limit its risk of loss in any particular year. The maximum exposure to loss related to the Company's involvement with this entity is limited to approximately $560,350 which is collateralized under a standby letter of credit issued on the insurance entity's behalf. See Note 9, \"Reinsurance, Commitments and Contingencies,\" for additional discussion of commitments associated with the insurance program and Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", for further information on a standby letter of credit.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company's operations over the last several years generally reflect three trends or events which the Company expects to continue: (i) increased attention to \"niche\" insurance products, such as the Company's funeral plan policies and traditional whole life products; (ii) emphasis on cemetery and mortuary business; and (iii) capitalizing on relatively low interest rates by originating mortgage loans.\nInsurance Operations\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's insurance operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Included in other revenue was rental income from residential and commercial properties purchased from Security National Life. Memorial Estates used financing provided by Security National Life to purchase these properties. The rental income was offset by property insurance, taxes, maintenance expenses and interest payments made to Security National Life. Memorial Estates recorded depreciation on these properties of $715,000, $858,000 and $945,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nMortgage Operations\nApproximately 64% of the Company's revenues for the fiscal year 2016 were through its wholly owned subsidiaries, SecurityNational Mortgage and EverLEND Mortgage. Both mortgage subsidiaries are mortgage lenders incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah and approved and regulated by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a department of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower, in addition to various conventional mortgage loan products. SecurityNational Mortgage and EverLEND Mortgage obtain mortgage loans originated in retail offices and through independent brokers. Mortgage loans originated by the Company's mortgage subsidiaries are funded through loan purchase agreements from Security National Life and unaffiliated financial institutions.\nThe Company's mortgage subsidiaries receive fees from the borrowers and secondary fees from third party investors that purchase their loans. Loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage are generally sold with mortgage servicing rights released to third party investors or retained by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage currently retains the mortgage servicing rights on approximately 30% of its loan origination volume. These loans are serviced by an approved third party sub-servicer.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SecurityNational Mortgage originated and sold 16,022 loans ($3,097,872,000 total volume), 14,976 loans ($2,843,455,000 total volume), and 10,794 loans ($2,037,337,000 total volume), respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, EverLEND Mortgage originated and sold three loans ($838,000 total volume), 79 loans ($17,949,000 total volume), and 33 loans ($7,298,000 total volume), respectively.\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's mortgage operations for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014.

However, management believes that the Company's reserve methodology and its current practice of property preservation allow it to estimate potential losses on loans sold. The amounts expensed for loan losses in years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4,689,000 and $6,295,000, respectively. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances were $628,000 and $2,806,000, respectively.\nSettlement of Investigation by U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) of Certain FHA-Insured Mortgage Loans Originated\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SecurityNational Mortgage, announced the execution of a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office in connection with the origination and underwriting by SecurityNational Mortgage of certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured loans. SecurityNational Mortgage, like many other high volume FHA-approved lenders, was being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for loan origination activities that occurred as long as nine years ago.\nWithout any admission of liability and in order to avoid the extended distractions and expenses associated with protracted litigation, SecurityNational Mortgage made a business decision to resolve this matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, SecurityNational Mortgage was required to make a payment in the amount of $4,250,000 to the U.S. Department of Justice, which payment was made on October 4, 2016. SecurityNational Mortgage continues to be able to originate FHA-insured mortgage loans and participate fully in all FHA programs as this settlement agreement does not affect SecurityNational Mortgage's status with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In addition, this settlement does not include any allegations or findings against any particular individuals, such as officers, directors, employees or agents of SecurityNational Mortgage.\nMortgage Loan Loss Litigation\nFor a description of the litigation involving SecurityNational Mortgage and Lehman Brothers and Aurora Loan Services, reference is to Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsurance Operations\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), premiums and other considerations received for interest sensitive products are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues. Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses.\nThe Company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited. Interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements.\nPremiums and other considerations received for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due. Future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits.\nThe costs related to acquiring new business, including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses (principally commissions), defined as deferred policy acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized into expense. For nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally \"locked in\" at the date the policies are issued. For interest sensitive products, these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. This amortization is adjusted when the Company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins. For example, deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity.\nDeath and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits. The profitability of the Company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality, other policyholder benefits, expense levels, interest spreads (i.e., the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders) and persistency. The Company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting, asset and liability duration matching, sound actuarial practices, adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges.\nCemetery and Mortuary Operations\nPre-need sales of funeral services and caskets, including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need funeral services and caskets, are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered.\nPre-need sales of cemetery interment rights (cemetery burial property), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery interment rights, are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of GAAP. Under GAAP, recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected. Revenues related to the pre-need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of GAAP, described above.\nPre-need sales of cemetery merchandise (primarily markers and vaults), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered.\nPre-need sales of cemetery services (primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery services, are deferred until the services are performed.\nPrearranged funeral and pre-need cemetery customer obtaining costs, including costs incurred related to obtaining new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of GAAP related to Financial Services - Insurance. Obtaining costs, which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed.\nRevenues and costs for at-need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists, the services are performed, collection is reasonably assured, and there are no significant obligations remaining.\nMortgage Operations\nMortgage fee income consists of origination fees, processing fees and certain other income related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans. For mortgage loans sold to third party investors, mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized pursuant to GAAP at the time the sales of the mortgage loans comply with the sales criteria for the transfer of financial assets. The sales criteria are as follows: (i) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company and its creditors, (ii) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the mortgage, and (iii) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred mortgage.\nThe Company must determine that all three sales criteria are met at the time a mortgage loan is funded. All rights and title to the mortgage loans are assigned to unrelated financial institution investors, including investor commitments for the loans made prior to warehouse banks purchasing the loans under the purchase commitments.\nThe Company sells mortgage loans to third party investors without recourse. It may be required, however, to repurchase a loan or pay a fee instead of repurchase under certain events, which include the following:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Failure to deliver original documents specified by the investor,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The existence of misrepresentation or fraud in the origination of the loan,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The loan becomes delinquent due to nonpayment during the first several months after it is sold,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Early pay-off of a loan, as defined by the agreements,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Excessive time to settle a loan,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Investor declines purchase, and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Discontinued product and expired commitment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan purchase commitments generally specify a date 30 to 45 days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled. Depending on market conditions, these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to the Company.\nIt is the Company's policy to cure any documentation problems regarding such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six-month time period and to pursue efforts to enforce loan purchase commitments from third-party investors concerning the loans. The Company believes that six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues, to enforce purchase commitments, and to exhaust other alternatives. Remedial methods include the following:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Research reasons for rejection,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Provide additional documents,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Request investor exceptions,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Appeal rejection decision to purchase committee, and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Commit to secondary investors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOnce purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted, which could be earlier than the six-month time period, the loans are repurchased and transferred to the long-term investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value and the previously recorded sales revenue is reversed. Any loan that later becomes delinquent is evaluated by the Company at that time and any impairment is adjusted accordingly.\nDetermining lower of cost or market. Cost is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by the Company. Market value, while often difficult to determine, is based on the following guidelines:\n \u00b7 For loans that have an active market, the Company uses the market price on the repurchase date. \u00b7 For loans where there is no market but there is a similar product, the Company uses the market value for the similar product on the repurchase date. \u00b7 For loans where no active market exists on the repurchase date, the Company determines that the unpaid principal balance best approximates the market value on the repurchase date, after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and estimated future cash flows. \nThe appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds significance to the Company's determination of fair value because, if the loan becomes delinquent, the Company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value of the loan. In determining the market value on the date of repurchase, the Company considers the total value of all of the loans because any sale of loans would be made as a pool.\nLoans that have been foreclosed are reclassified as real estate held for investment. The Company carries the foreclosed properties in either Security National Life, Memorial Estates, or SecurityNational Mortgage and rents the properties until it is deemed economically desirable to sell them.\nThe majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors. The amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as mortgage loans sold to investors, and include the fees due from the investors.\nUse of Significant Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates, and critical issues that impact them:\nLoan Commitments\nThe Company estimates the fair value of a mortgage loan commitment based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, quoted MBS prices, estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and an estimate of the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the commitment net of estimated commission expense. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the mortgage loan commitment is issued and is shown net of related expenses. Following issuance, the value of a loan commitment can be either positive or negative depending upon the change in value of the underlying mortgage loans. Fallout rates and other factors from the Company's recent historical data are used to estimate the quantity and value of mortgage loans that will fund within the terms of the commitments.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following: yield on investments supporting the liabilities, amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies, amount of policy fees and charges, amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies, amount of death and surrender benefits, and the length of time the policies will stay in force.\nFor nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally \"locked in\" at the date the policies are issued.\nValue of Business Acquired\nValue of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs. The critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired.\nMortgage Loans Foreclosed to Real Estate Held for Investment\nThese properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon foreclosure. The Company believes that in an orderly market fair value will approximate the replacement cost of a home and the rental income provides a cash flow stream for investment analysis. The Company believes the highest and best use of the properties are as income producing assets since it is the Company's intent to hold the properties as rental properties, matching the income from the investment in rental properties with the funds required for future estimated policy claims. Accordingly, the fair value determination will be weighted more heavily toward the rental analysis.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nReserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the policies, mortality experience, expenses, investment yield, lapse rates, surrender rates, and dividend crediting rates.\nThese assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of products, these assumptions are generally held constant.\nUnearned Revenue\nThe universal life products the Company sells have significant policy initiation fees (front-end load) that are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. The same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue.\nDeferred Pre-need Cemetery and Funeral Contracts Revenues and Estimated Future Cost of Pre-need Sales\nThe revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed.\nThe Company, through its cemetery and mortuary operations, provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices. To accomplish this, the Company, through its life insurance operations, sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries. If, at the time of need, the policyholder or potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the Company's facilities, the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price. The increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices. Risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage Service Rights (MSR) arise from contractual agreements between the Company and third-party investors (or their agents) when mortgage loans are sold. Under these contracts, the Company is obligated to retain and provide loan servicing functions on the loans sold, in exchange for fees and other remuneration. The servicing functions typically performed include, among other responsibilities, collecting and remitting loan payments; responding to borrower inquiries; accounting for principal and interest, holding custodial (impound) funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising the acquisition of real estate owned and property dispositions. The Company initially accounts for MSRs at fair value and subsequently accounts for them using the amortization method. MSR amortization is determined by amortizing the balance straight-line over an estimated seven and nine-year life. The Company periodically assesses MSRs accounted for using the amortization method for impairment.\nMortgage Allowance for Loan Loss and Loan Loss Reserve\nThe Company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses (a contra-asset account) and through the mortgage loan loss reserve (a liability account). The allowance for loan losses is an allowance for losses on the Company's mortgage loans held for investment. The allowance is comprised of two components. The first component is an allowance for collectively evaluated impairment that is based upon the Company's historical experience in collecting similar receivables. The second component is based upon individual evaluation of loans that are determined to be impaired. Upon determining impairment, the Company establishes an individual impairment allowance based upon an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nWhen a mortgage loan is past due more than 90 days, the Company, where appropriate, sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. When foreclosure is commenced on a delinquent loan, all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred. Once foreclosed the carrying value should approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate owned. The Company is currently able to rent properties at a 2% to 8% gross return.\nThe mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors. The Company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company's estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities.\nUpon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions. The Company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on total production. This estimate is based on the Company's historical experience. The amount accrued for and the charge to expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require various estimates and judgments and may be affected favorably or unfavorably by various internal and external factors. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from temporary differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and in estimating the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets recoverable in future periods. Factors affecting the deferred tax assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, and changes to overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Changes in these estimates, judgments or factors may result in an increase or decrease to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities with a related increase or decrease in the Company's provision for income taxes.\nResults of Consolidated Operations\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal revenues increased by $22,644,000, or 8.0%, to $307,208,000 for fiscal year 2016 from $284,564,000 for the fiscal year 2015. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a $10,690,000 increase in mortgage fee income, an $8,091,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a $3,574,000 increase in net investment income, a $1,766,000 increase in other revenues, a $765,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales, and a $335,000 decrease in other than temporary impairments. This increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $2,577,000 decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets.\nInsurance premiums and other considerations increased by $8,091,000, or 14.3%, to $64,501,000 for 2016, from $56,410,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in renewal premiums and an increase in first year premiums as a result of increased insurance sales in 2016.\nNet investment income increased by $3,574,000, or 10.5%, to $37,582,000 for 2016, from $34,008,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $2,961,000 increase in insurance assignment income, a $1,515,000 increase in income from real estate held for investment, a $1,267,000 increase in interest from mortgage loans, an $804,000 increase in fixed maturity securities income and a $31,000 increase in policy loans income. This increase was partially offset by a $2,610,000 decrease in income from short-term investments and a $406,000 increase in investment expenses.\nNet cemetery and mortuary sales increased by $765,000, or 6.7%, to $12,267,000 for 2016, from $11,502,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in at-need sales and pre-need sales in both the cemetery and mortuary operations.\nRealized gains on investments and other assets decreased by $2,577,000, or 107.3%, to $176,000 in realized losses for 2016, from $2,401,000 in realized gains for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets was primarily attributable to a $2,577,000 decrease in realized gains on other assets due to the sale of an office building in 2015, which was offset by an increase in impairments on real estate held for investment in 2016, and a $47,000 decrease in realized gains on fixed maturity securities. This decrease was also partially offset by a $47,000 increase in realized gains on securities available for sale.\nOther than temporary impairments on investments decreased by $335,000, or 55.3%, to $270,000 for 2016 from $605,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in impairments on fixed maturity securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.\nMortgage fee income increased by $10,690,000, or 6.1%, to $186,416,000 for 2016, from $175,726,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage loan originations.\nOther revenues increased by $1,766,000, or 34.5%, to $6,888,000 for 2016 from $5,122,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenues.\nTotal benefits and expenses were $286,468,000, or 93.2% of total revenues, for 2016, as compared to $263,339,000, or 93.0% of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2015.\nDeath benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits increased by an aggregate of $4,102,000, or 8.1%, to $54,864,000 for 2016, from $50,762,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $4,264,000 increase in future policy benefits, which was partially offset by a $125,000 decrease in death benefits and a $37,000 decrease in surrenders and other policy benefits.\nAmortization of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired increased by $2,362,000, or 41.9%, to $8,003,000 for 2016, from $5,641,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance sales expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16,028,000, or 8.0%, to $216,702,000 for 2016, from $200,674,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $9,394,000 increase in personnel expenses resulting from increased salaries for existing employees and the hiring of new employees, a $5,827,000 increase in commission expenses, a $1,616,000 increase in other expenses, a $695,000 increase in advertising expenses and a $210,000 increase in rent and rent related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1,606,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $108,000 decrease in costs related to funding mortgage loans.\nInterest expense increased by $654,000, or 14.7%, to $5,112,000 for 2016, from $4,458,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the completion of the construction of the Dry Creek at East Village Apartments development in December 2015, resulting in the interest from the bank loan that had been capitalized during the construction phase of the project being expensed in 2016.\nCost of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries decreased by $16,000, or 0.9%, to $1,787,000 for 2016, from $1,803,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortuary at-need sales, which was offset by an increase in cemetery pre-need sales.\nOther comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to a gain of $764,000 and a loss of $761,000, respectively. This increase of $1,525,000 in 2016 was primarily the result of a $1,529,000 unrealized gain in marketable securities.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues increased by $57,186,000, or 25.1%, to $284,564,000 for fiscal year 2015 from $227,379,000 for the fiscal year 2014. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a $46,588,000 increase in mortgage fee income, a $5,704,000 increase in net investment income, a $3,401,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a $1,375,000 increase in other revenues, a $483,000 increase in realized gains on investments and other assets, and a $76,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales. This increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $441,000 increase in other than temporary impairments.\nInsurance premiums and other considerations increased by $3,401,000, or 6.4%, to $56,410,000 for 2015, from $53,009,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in renewal premiums and an increase in first year premiums as a result of increased insurance sales in 2015.\nNet investment income increased by $5,704,000, or 20.2%, to $34,008,000 for 2015, from $28,304,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4,119,000 increase in income from short-term investments, a $1,021,000 increase in income from real estate, a $414,000 decrease in investment expenses, a $146,000 increase in interest from mortgage loans, a $57,000 increase in equity securities income, and an $8,000 increase in policy loans income. This increase was partially offset by a $61,000 decrease in fixed maturity securities income.\nNet cemetery and mortuary sales increased by $76,000, or 0.7%, to $11,502,000 for 2015, from $11,426,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $249,000 increase in cemetery pre-need and at-need sales. This increase was partially offset by a $173,000 decrease in mortuary at-need sales.\nRealized gains on investments and other assets increased by $483,000, or 25.2%, to $2,401,000 in realized gains for 2015, from $1,918,000 in realized gains for the comparable period in 2014. This increase in realized gains and losses on investments and other assets was primarily due to a $677,000 increase in gains and losses on other assets. This increase was partially offset by a $180,000 decrease in gains and losses on marketable securities, and a $14,000 decrease in gains and losses on fixed maturity securities held to maturity.\nOther than temporary impairments on investments increased by $441,000, or 268.6%, to $605,000 for 2015 from $164,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to a $192,000 increase in impairments on real estate held for investment and mortgage loans, and a $249,000 increase in impairments on marketable securities.\nMortgage fee income increased by $46,588,000, or 36.1%, to $175,727,000 for 2015, from $129,139,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage loan originations and higher secondary gains from mortgage loans sold to investors.\nOther revenues increased by $1,375,000, or 36.7%, to $5,122,000 for 2015 from $3,747,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenues.\nTotal benefits and expenses were $263,339,000, or 93.0% of total revenues, for 2015, as compared to $214,456,000, or 94.5% of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2014.\nDeath benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits increased by an aggregate of $2,912,000, or 6.1%, to $50,762,000 for 2015, from $47,850,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $4,058,000 in death benefits, which was partially offset by decreases of $848,000 in future policy benefits, and $298,000 in surrenders and other policy benefits.\nAmortization of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired decreased by $1,252,000, or 18.2%, to $5,641,000 for 2015, from $6,893,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to improved persistency in the payment of premiums in the traditional life business.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $45,809,000, or 29.6%, to $200,674,000 for 2015, from $154,865,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $22,059,000 increase in commission expenses, an $11,500,000 increase in personnel expenses, a $4,154,000 increase in other expenses, a $3,242,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $1,987,000 increase in costs related to funding mortgage loans, and a $1,715,000 increase in rent and rent related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1,146,000 decrease in advertising expenses. These increased expenses in 2015 were primarily due to the additional costs and expenses associated with the Company's significant increases in the number of mortgage loan originations in 2015.\nInterest expense increased by $1,464,000, or 48.9%, to $4,458,000 for 2015, from $2,994,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in outstanding balances on warehouse lines of credit that are used to fund mortgage loans.\nCost of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries decreased by $50,000, or 2.7%, to $1,803,000 for 2015, from $1,853,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortuary at-need sales, which was offset by an increase in cemetery pre-need and at-need sales.\nOther comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 amounted to losses of $761,000 and $49,000, respectively. This decrease of $712,000 in 2015 was primarily the result of a $705,000 unrealized loss in marketable securities.\nRisks\nThe following is a description of the most significant risks facing the Company and how it mitigates those risks:\nLegal and Regulatory Risks. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the Company operates may create additional expenses and risks not anticipated by the Company in developing and pricing its products. Regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits, new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the Company's mortgage sales. Also, the Company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery and mortuary business. The Company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations, thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction, and also by employing underwriting practices that identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks.\nMortgage Industry Risks. Developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets can adversely affect the Company's ability to sell its mortgage loans to investors, which can impact the Company's financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding and servicing any unsold loans.\nThe mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company could realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors. The Company's mortgage subsidiaries may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company's estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities.\nUpon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions. The amounts expensed for loan losses in years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $4,689,000, $6,295,000 and $3,053,000, respectively, and the charge to expense has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances were $628,000 and $2,806,000, respectively. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of December 31, 2016. There is a risk, however, that future loan losses may exceed the loan loss reserves and allowances.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of $3,184,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than 90 days. Of this amount, $1,829,000 of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings. The Company has not received or recognized any interest income on the $3,184,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than 90 days. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company decreased its allowance for mortgage losses by $99,000 and $31,000, respectively, which was charged to bad debt expense and included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period. The allowances for mortgage loan losses as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,749,000 and $1,848,000, respectively.\nAt various times third party investors have asserted that SecurityNational Mortgage sold mortgage loans that allegedly contained borrower misrepresentations or experienced early payment defaults, or that were otherwise allegedly defective or not in compliance with loan purchase agreements involving SecurityNational Mortgage. As a result of these claims, third party investors have made demands at times that SecurityNational Mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans.\nThe total amount of potential claims by third party investors is difficult to determine. The Company has reserved and accrued $628,000 as of December 31, 2016 to settle all such investor related claims. The Company believes that the reserve for mortgage loan losses, which includes provisions for probable losses and indemnification on mortgage loans sold to investors, is reasonable based on available information. Moreover, the Company has successfully negotiated acceptable settlement terms with other third party investors that asserted claims for mortgage loan losses against SecurityNational Mortgage.\nSecurityNational Mortgage disagrees with the repurchase demands and notices of potential claims from third party investors. Furthermore, SecurityNational Mortgage believes there is potential to resolve the alleged claims by the third-party investors on acceptable terms. If SecurityNational Mortgage is unable to resolve such claims on acceptable terms, legal action may ensue. In the event of legal action by any third-party investor, SecurityNational Mortgage believes it has significant defenses to any such action and intends to vigorously defend itself against such action.\nInterest Rate Risk. The risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the Company's investments or impair the ability of the Company to market its mortgage and cemetery/mortuary products. This change in rates may cause certain interest-sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation. The Company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non-conformance with certain policy provisions, by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser, and by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities. To the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature, the Company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale.\nMortality and Morbidity Risks. The risk that the Company's actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality and morbidity experiences may cause the Company's products to be underpriced, may cause the Company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated, and other potentially adverse consequences to the business. The Company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices, asset and liability duration matching, and sound actuarial practices.\nEstimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term are those used in determining the value of derivative assets and liabilities, those used in determining deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, those used in determining the value of mortgage loans foreclosed to real estate held for investment, those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and unearned revenue, those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre-need sales, those used in determining the value of mortgage servicing rights, those used in determining allowances for loan losses for mortgage loans on real estate, those used in determining loan loss reserve, and those used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are fairly stated in all material respects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums, contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business, from interest and dividends on invested assets, and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments. The mortgage subsidiaries realize cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors. The Company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities, which generally are long-term, and adequate to pay current policyholder claims, annuity payments, expenses related to the issuance of new policies, the maintenance of existing policies, debt service, and to meet current operating expenses.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operations provided cash of $43,860,000. This was primarily due to an increase in cash collected on mortgage loans sold to investors. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company's operations used cash of $15,831,000. This was primarily due to an increase in cash paid on mortgage loans sold to investors.\nThe Company's liability for future life, annuity and other benefits is expected to be paid out over the long-term due to the Company's market niche of selling funeral plans. Funeral plans are small face value life insurance that will pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person's death. A person generally will keep these policies in force and will not surrender them prior to a person's death. Because of the long-term nature of these liabilities, the Company is able to hold to maturity its bonds, real estate and mortgage loans thus reducing the risk of liquidating these long-term investments as a result of any sudden changes in market values.\nThe Company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities. The Company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing. The Company purchases short-term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short-term requirements of the Company's products. The Company's investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return, which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements.\nThe Company's investment policy is also to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities, real estate, mortgage loans, and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short-term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries. Bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to $184,356,000 and $144,946,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This represents 33.1% and 32.9% of the total investments as of December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Generally, all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Under this rating system, there are six categories used for rating bonds. At December 31, 2016, 9.0% (or $16,513,000) and at December 31, 2015, 8.3% (or $11,990,000) of the Company's total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six, which are considered non-investment grade.\nThe Company has classified certain of its fixed income securities, including high-yield securities, in its portfolio as available for sale, with the remainder classified as held to maturity. In accordance with Company policy, however, any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity. Notwithstanding, business conditions may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio. In that event, the Company believes it could sell short-term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer-term securities.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities and for the schedule of principal payments for mortgage loans on real estate and construction loans held for investment.\nIf market conditions were to cause interest rates to change, the market value of the Company's fixed income portfolio, which includes bonds, preferred stock, and mortgage loans, could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing (the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique):\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -200 bps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -100 bps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +100 bps\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +200 bps\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Market Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,572\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,491\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,119\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (30,069\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets, liabilities, disintermediation, and business risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria.\nThe Company's total capitalization of stockholders' equity, and bank loans and notes payable were $181,898,000 as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $152,155,000 as of December 31, 2015. Stockholders' equity as a percent of total capitalization was 70.5% and 73.1% as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Bank loans and notes payable increased by $12,810,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, thus decreasing the stockholders' equity percentage.\nLapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period. The Company's lapse rate for life insurance was 9.6% in 2016 as compared to a rate of 7.4% for 2015.\nAt December 31, 2016, $44,055,000 of the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity represents the statutory stockholders' equity of the Company's life insurance subsidiaries. The life insurance subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend to its parent company without the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their businesses without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements. The Company desires to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the act.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, together with related data and projections, about the Company's projected financial results and its future plans and strategies. However, actual results and needs of the Company may vary materially from forward-looking statements and projections made from time to time by the Company on the basis of management's then-current expectations. The business in which the Company is engaged involves changing and competitive markets, which may involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements and projections will prove accurate.\nFactors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted in such forward looking statements include among others, the following possibilities: (i) heightened competition, including the intensification of price competition, the entry of new competitors, and the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors; (ii) adverse state and federal legislation or regulation, including decreases in rates, limitations on premium levels, increases in minimum capital and reserve requirements, benefit mandates and tax treatment of insurance products; (iii) fluctuations in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income or increase in interest expense and in the market value of interest rate sensitive investment; (iv) failure to obtain new customers, retain existing customers or reductions in policies in force by existing customers; (v) higher service, administrative, or general expense due to the need for additional advertising, marketing, administrative or management information systems expenditures; (vi) loss or retirement of key executives or employees; (vii) increases in medical costs; (viii) changes in the Company's liquidity due to changes in asset and liability matching; (ix) restrictions on insurance underwriting based on genetic testing and other criteria; (x) adverse changes in the ratings obtained by independent rating agencies; (xi) failure to maintain adequate reinsurance; (xii) possible claims relating to sales practices for insurance products and claim denials and (xiii) adverse trends in mortality and morbidity; (xiv) deterioration of real estate markets and (xv) lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.\nOff-Balance Sheet Agreements\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating $560,350, to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to additional risk assessments pertaining to the Company's captive insurance program. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit because claims are not expected to exceed premiums paid. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of this letter of credit is zero.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under standby letters of credit aggregating $1,250,000, to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to claims filed in states where the Company's mortgage segment is licensed. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of these standby letters of credit. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of these letters of credit is zero.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating $48,220, issued as a security deposit to guarantee payment of final bills for electric and gas utility services for a commercial real estate property owned by the Company in Wichita, Kansas. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of this letter of credit is zero.\nSecurityNational Mortgage has entered into loan purchase agreements and subsequent amendments to originate and sell mortgage loans to two unaffiliated warehouse banks. On March 19, 2012, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") entered into a loan purchase agreement in which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a warehouse line of up to $55,000,000 to fund certain approved mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage. On December 10, 2015, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo agreed to an amendment to the March 19, 2012 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $55,000,000 to $70,000,000. On June 6, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo agreed to another amendment to the March 19, 2012 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $70,000,000 to $100,000,000.\nOn August 14, 2015, SecurityNational Mortgage entered into a loan purchase agreement with Texas Capital Bank. The loan purchase agreement provides a warehouse line of up to $30,000,000 to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage is listed as seller and the Company as guarantor in the agreement. On September 7, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage and Texas Capital Bank agreed to an amendment to the August 14, 2015 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $30,000,000 to $100,000,000.\nGenerally, when mortgage loans are sold to the warehouse banks, the Company is no longer obligated to pay the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loans, but is required to pay a fee in the form of interest on the mortgage loans between the date the loans are sold to warehouse banks and the settlement date with the third-party investors. The terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year, with interest accruing on the mortgage loans at annual rates ranging from 2.5% to 2.75% over the 30-day Libor rate.\nAs of December 31, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage had $181,573,000 in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending and EverLEND Mortgage had $-0- in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending.\nThe total of the Company's unfunded residential construction loan and land development loan commitments as of December 31, 2016, was $15,622,000.\nThe Company entered into a Construction Loan Agreement between Key Bank National Association and 5300 Development LLC, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay Key Bank the current outstanding principal up to $40,740,000 plus interest. These funds are being used for the construction of phase 1 of the Company's new corporate campus development in Salt Lake City Utah. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has used $8,778,000 of these funds.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, and the payments due by period are shown in the following table:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> over\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,556,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,857,212\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 534,151\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,438\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,984,894\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank and other loans payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,755,443\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,668,543\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,502,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,791,717\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,718,548\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,311,536\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,525,755\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,036,996\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,829,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,703,442\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCasualty Insurance Program\nIn conjunction with the Company's casualty insurance program, limited equity interests are held in a captive insurance entity. This program permits the Company to self-insure a portion of losses, to gain access to a wide array of safety-related services, to pool insurance risks and resources in order to obtain more competitive pricing for administration and reinsurance and to limit its risk of loss in any particular year. The maximum exposure to loss related to the Company's involvement with this entity is limited to approximately $560,350 which is collateralized under a standby letter of credit issued on the insurance entity's behalf. See Note 9, \"Reinsurance, Commitments and Contingencies,\" for additional discussion of commitments associated with the insurance program and Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", for further information on a standby letter of credit.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company's operations over the last several years generally reflect three trends or events which the Company expects to continue: (i) increased attention to \"niche\" insurance products, such as the Company's funeral plan policies and traditional whole life products; (ii) emphasis on cemetery and mortuary business; and (iii) capitalizing on relatively low interest rates by originating mortgage loans.\nInsurance Operations\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's insurance operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIntersegment revenues for the Company's insurance operations are primarily interest income from the warehouse line provided to SecurityNational Mortgage Company. Profitability in 2016 has decreased due to a decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets, which was partially offset by an increase in net investment income and an increase in insurance premiums.\nCemetery and Mortuary Operations\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's cemetery and mortuary operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe majority of the realized gain in the Company's cemetery and mortuary operations in 2014 was due to the sale of real estate located in Phoenix, Arizona. Included in other revenue was rental income from residential and commercial properties purchased from Security National Life. Memorial Estates used financing provided by Security National Life to purchase these properties. The rental income was offset by property insurance, taxes, maintenance expenses and interest payments made to Security National Life. Memorial Estates recorded depreciation on these properties of $715,000, $858,000 and $945,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nMortgage Operations\nApproximately 64% of the Company's revenues for the fiscal year 2016 were through its wholly owned subsidiaries, SecurityNational Mortgage and EverLEND Mortgage. Both mortgage subsidiaries are mortgage lenders incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah and approved and regulated by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a department of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower, in addition to various conventional mortgage loan products. SecurityNational Mortgage and EverLEND Mortgage obtain mortgage loans originated in retail offices and through independent brokers. Mortgage loans originated by the Company's mortgage subsidiaries are funded through loan purchase agreements from Security National Life and unaffiliated financial institutions.\nThe Company's mortgage subsidiaries receive fees from the borrowers and secondary fees from third party investors that purchase their loans. Loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage are generally sold with mortgage servicing rights released to third party investors or retained by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage currently retains the mortgage servicing rights on approximately 30% of its loan origination volume. These loans are serviced by an approved third party sub-servicer.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SecurityNational Mortgage originated and sold 16,022 loans ($3,097,872,000 total volume), 14,976 loans ($2,843,455,000 total volume), and 10,794 loans ($2,037,337,000 total volume), respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, EverLEND Mortgage originated and sold three loans ($838,000 total volume), 79 loans ($17,949,000 total volume), and 33 loans ($7,298,000 total volume), respectively.\nThe following table shows the condensed financial results for the Company's mortgage operations for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 14 and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe increase in revenues for the Company's mortgage operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in mortgage loan originations and fee income from the loan originations.\nMortgage Loan Loss Settlements\nFuture loan losses can be extremely difficult to estimate. However, management believes that the Company's reserve methodology and its current practice of property preservation allow it to estimate potential losses on loans sold. The amounts expensed for loan losses in years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4,689,000 and $6,295,000, respectively. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances were $628,000 and $2,806,000, respectively.\nSettlement of Investigation by U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) of Certain FHA-Insured Mortgage Loans Originated\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SecurityNational Mortgage, announced the execution of a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office in connection with the origination and underwriting by SecurityNational Mortgage of certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured loans. SecurityNational Mortgage, like many other high volume FHA-approved lenders, was being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for loan origination activities that occurred as long as nine years ago.\nWithout any admission of liability and in order to avoid the extended distractions and expenses associated with protracted litigation, SecurityNational Mortgage made a business decision to resolve this matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, SecurityNational Mortgage was required to make a payment in the amount of $4,250,000 to the U.S. Department of Justice, which payment was made on October 4, 2016. SecurityNational Mortgage continues to be able to originate FHA-insured mortgage loans and participate fully in all FHA programs as this settlement agreement does not affect SecurityNational Mortgage's status with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In addition, this settlement does not include any allegations or findings against any particular individuals, such as officers, directors, employees or agents of SecurityNational Mortgage.\nMortgage Loan Loss Litigation\nFor a description of the litigation involving SecurityNational Mortgage and Lehman Brothers and Aurora Loan Services, reference is to Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsurance Operations\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), premiums and other considerations received for interest sensitive products are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues. Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses.\nThe Company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited. Interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements.\nPremiums and other considerations received for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due. Future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits.\nThe costs related to acquiring new business, including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses (principally commissions), defined as deferred policy acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized into expense. For nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally \"locked in\" at the date the policies are issued. For interest sensitive products, these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. This amortization is adjusted when the Company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins. For example, deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity.\nDeath and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits. The profitability of the Company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality, other policyholder benefits, expense levels, interest spreads (i.e., the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders) and persistency. The Company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting, asset and liability duration matching, sound actuarial practices, adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges.\nCemetery and Mortuary Operations\nPre-need sales of funeral services and caskets, including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need funeral services and caskets, are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered.\nPre-need sales of cemetery interment rights (cemetery burial property), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery interment rights, are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of GAAP. Under GAAP, recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected. Revenues related to the pre-need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of GAAP, described above.\nPre-need sales of cemetery merchandise (primarily markers and vaults), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered.\nPre-need sales of cemetery services (primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery services, are deferred until the services are performed.\nPrearranged funeral and pre-need cemetery customer obtaining costs, including costs incurred related to obtaining new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of GAAP related to Financial Services - Insurance. Obtaining costs, which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed.\nRevenues and costs for at-need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists, the services are performed, collection is reasonably assured, and there are no significant obligations remaining.\nMortgage Operations\nMortgage fee income consists of origination fees, processing fees and certain other income related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans. For mortgage loans sold to third party investors, mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized pursuant to GAAP at the time the sales of the mortgage loans comply with the sales criteria for the transfer of financial assets. The sales criteria are as follows: (i) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company and its creditors, (ii) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the mortgage, and (iii) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred mortgage.\nThe Company must determine that all three sales criteria are met at the time a mortgage loan is funded. All rights and title to the mortgage loans are assigned to unrelated financial institution investors, including investor commitments for the loans made prior to warehouse banks purchasing the loans under the purchase commitments.\nThe Company sells mortgage loans to third party investors without recourse. It may be required, however, to repurchase a loan or pay a fee instead of repurchase under certain events, which include the following:\n\nLoan purchase commitments generally specify a date 30 to 45 days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled. Depending on market conditions, these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to the Company.\nIt is the Company's policy to cure any documentation problems regarding such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six-month time period and to pursue efforts to enforce loan purchase commitments from third-party investors concerning the loans. The Company believes that six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues, to enforce purchase commitments, and to exhaust other alternatives. Remedial methods include the following:\n\nOnce purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted, which could be earlier than the six-month time period, the loans are repurchased and transferred to the long-term investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value and the previously recorded sales revenue is reversed. Any loan that later becomes delinquent is evaluated by the Company at that time and any impairment is adjusted accordingly.\nDetermining lower of cost or market. Cost is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by the Company. Market value, while often difficult to determine, is based on the following guidelines:\n \u00b7 For loans that have an active market, the Company uses the market price on the repurchase date. \u00b7 For loans where there is no market but there is a similar product, the Company uses the market value for the similar product on the repurchase date. \u00b7 For loans where no active market exists on the repurchase date, the Company determines that the unpaid principal balance best approximates the market value on the repurchase date, after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and estimated future cash flows. \nThe appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds significance to the Company's determination of fair value because, if the loan becomes delinquent, the Company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value of the loan. In determining the market value on the date of repurchase, the Company considers the total value of all of the loans because any sale of loans would be made as a pool.\nLoans that have been foreclosed are reclassified as real estate held for investment. The Company carries the foreclosed properties in either Security National Life, Memorial Estates, or SecurityNational Mortgage and rents the properties until it is deemed economically desirable to sell them.\nThe majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors. The amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as mortgage loans sold to investors, and include the fees due from the investors.\nUse of Significant Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates, and critical issues that impact them:\nLoan Commitments\nThe Company estimates the fair value of a mortgage loan commitment based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, quoted MBS prices, estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and an estimate of the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the commitment net of estimated commission expense. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the mortgage loan commitment is issued and is shown net of related expenses. Following issuance, the value of a loan commitment can be either positive or negative depending upon the change in value of the underlying mortgage loans. Fallout rates and other factors from the Company's recent historical data are used to estimate the quantity and value of mortgage loans that will fund within the terms of the commitments.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following: yield on investments supporting the liabilities, amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies, amount of policy fees and charges, amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies, amount of death and surrender benefits, and the length of time the policies will stay in force.\nFor nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally \"locked in\" at the date the policies are issued.\nValue of Business Acquired\nValue of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs. The critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired.\nMortgage Loans Foreclosed to Real Estate Held for Investment\nThese properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon foreclosure. The Company believes that in an orderly market fair value will approximate the replacement cost of a home and the rental income provides a cash flow stream for investment analysis. The Company believes the highest and best use of the properties are as income producing assets since it is the Company's intent to hold the properties as rental properties, matching the income from the investment in rental properties with the funds required for future estimated policy claims. Accordingly, the fair value determination will be weighted more heavily toward the rental analysis.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nReserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the policies, mortality experience, expenses, investment yield, lapse rates, surrender rates, and dividend crediting rates.\nThese assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of products, these assumptions are generally held constant.\nUnearned Revenue\nThe universal life products the Company sells have significant policy initiation fees (front-end load) that are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. The same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue.\nDeferred Pre-need Cemetery and Funeral Contracts Revenues and Estimated Future Cost of Pre-need Sales\nThe revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed.\nThe Company, through its cemetery and mortuary operations, provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices. To accomplish this, the Company, through its life insurance operations, sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries. If, at the time of need, the policyholder or potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the Company's facilities, the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price. The increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices. Risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage Service Rights (MSR) arise from contractual agreements between the Company and third-party investors (or their agents) when mortgage loans are sold. Under these contracts, the Company is obligated to retain and provide loan servicing functions on the loans sold, in exchange for fees and other remuneration. The servicing functions typically performed include, among other responsibilities, collecting and remitting loan payments; responding to borrower inquiries; accounting for principal and interest, holding custodial (impound) funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising the acquisition of real estate owned and property dispositions. The Company initially accounts for MSRs at fair value and subsequently accounts for them using the amortization method. MSR amortization is determined by amortizing the balance straight-line over an estimated seven and nine-year life. The Company periodically assesses MSRs accounted for using the amortization method for impairment.\nMortgage Allowance for Loan Loss and Loan Loss Reserve\nThe Company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses (a contra-asset account) and through the mortgage loan loss reserve (a liability account). The allowance for loan losses is an allowance for losses on the Company's mortgage loans held for investment. The allowance is comprised of two components. The first component is an allowance for collectively evaluated impairment that is based upon the Company's historical experience in collecting similar receivables. The second component is based upon individual evaluation of loans that are determined to be impaired. Upon determining impairment, the Company establishes an individual impairment allowance based upon an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nWhen a mortgage loan is past due more than 90 days, the Company, where appropriate, sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. When foreclosure is commenced on a delinquent loan, all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred. Once foreclosed the carrying value should approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate owned. The Company is currently able to rent properties at a 2% to 8% gross return.\nThe mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors. The Company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company's estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities.\nUpon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions. The Company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on total production. This estimate is based on the Company's historical experience. The amount accrued for and the charge to expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require various estimates and judgments and may be affected favorably or unfavorably by various internal and external factors. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from temporary differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and in estimating the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets recoverable in future periods. Factors affecting the deferred tax assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, and changes to overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Changes in these estimates, judgments or factors may result in an increase or decrease to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities with a related increase or decrease in the Company's provision for income taxes.\nResults of Consolidated Operations\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal revenues increased by $22,644,000, or 8.0%, to $307,208,000 for fiscal year 2016 from $284,564,000 for the fiscal year 2015. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a $10,690,000 increase in mortgage fee income, an $8,091,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a $3,574,000 increase in net investment income, a $1,766,000 increase in other revenues, a $765,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales, and a $335,000 decrease in other than temporary impairments. This increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $2,577,000 decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets.\nInsurance premiums and other considerations increased by $8,091,000, or 14.3%, to $64,501,000 for 2016, from $56,410,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in renewal premiums and an increase in first year premiums as a result of increased insurance sales in 2016.\nNet investment income increased by $3,574,000, or 10.5%, to $37,582,000 for 2016, from $34,008,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $2,961,000 increase in insurance assignment income, a $1,515,000 increase in income from real estate held for investment, a $1,267,000 increase in interest from mortgage loans, an $804,000 increase in fixed maturity securities income and a $31,000 increase in policy loans income. This increase was partially offset by a $2,610,000 decrease in income from short-term investments and a $406,000 increase in investment expenses.\nNet cemetery and mortuary sales increased by $765,000, or 6.7%, to $12,267,000 for 2016, from $11,502,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in at-need sales and pre-need sales in both the cemetery and mortuary operations.\nRealized gains on investments and other assets decreased by $2,577,000, or 107.3%, to $176,000 in realized losses for 2016, from $2,401,000 in realized gains for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease in realized gains on investments and other assets was primarily attributable to a $2,577,000 decrease in realized gains on other assets due to the sale of an office building in 2015, which was offset by an increase in impairments on real estate held for investment in 2016, and a $47,000 decrease in realized gains on fixed maturity securities. This decrease was also partially offset by a $47,000 increase in realized gains on securities available for sale.\nOther than temporary impairments on investments decreased by $335,000, or 55.3%, to $270,000 for 2016 from $605,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in impairments on fixed maturity securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.\nMortgage fee income increased by $10,690,000, or 6.1%, to $186,416,000 for 2016, from $175,726,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage loan originations.\nOther revenues increased by $1,766,000, or 34.5%, to $6,888,000 for 2016 from $5,122,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenues.\nTotal benefits and expenses were $286,468,000, or 93.2% of total revenues, for 2016, as compared to $263,339,000, or 93.0% of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2015.\nDeath benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits increased by an aggregate of $4,102,000, or 8.1%, to $54,864,000 for 2016, from $50,762,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $4,264,000 increase in future policy benefits, which was partially offset by a $125,000 decrease in death benefits and a $37,000 decrease in surrenders and other policy benefits.\nAmortization of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired increased by $2,362,000, or 41.9%, to $8,003,000 for 2016, from $5,641,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance sales expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16,028,000, or 8.0%, to $216,702,000 for 2016, from $200,674,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $9,394,000 increase in personnel expenses resulting from increased salaries for existing employees and the hiring of new employees, a $5,827,000 increase in commission expenses, a $1,616,000 increase in other expenses, a $695,000 increase in advertising expenses and a $210,000 increase in rent and rent related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1,606,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $108,000 decrease in costs related to funding mortgage loans.\nInterest expense increased by $654,000, or 14.7%, to $5,112,000 for 2016, from $4,458,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the completion of the construction of the Dry Creek at East Village Apartments development in December 2015, resulting in the interest from the bank loan that had been capitalized during the construction phase of the project being expensed in 2016.\nCost of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries decreased by $16,000, or 0.9%, to $1,787,000 for 2016, from $1,803,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortuary at-need sales, which was offset by an increase in cemetery pre-need sales.\nOther comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to a gain of $764,000 and a loss of $761,000, respectively. This increase of $1,525,000 in 2016 was primarily the result of a $1,529,000 unrealized gain in marketable securities.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues increased by $57,186,000, or 25.1%, to $284,564,000 for fiscal year 2015 from $227,379,000 for the fiscal year 2014. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a $46,588,000 increase in mortgage fee income, a $5,704,000 increase in net investment income, a $3,401,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a $1,375,000 increase in other revenues, a $483,000 increase in realized gains on investments and other assets, and a $76,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales. This increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $441,000 increase in other than temporary impairments.\nInsurance premiums and other considerations increased by $3,401,000, or 6.4%, to $56,410,000 for 2015, from $53,009,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in renewal premiums and an increase in first year premiums as a result of increased insurance sales in 2015.\nNet investment income increased by $5,704,000, or 20.2%, to $34,008,000 for 2015, from $28,304,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4,119,000 increase in income from short-term investments, a $1,021,000 increase in income from real estate, a $414,000 decrease in investment expenses, a $146,000 increase in interest from mortgage loans, a $57,000 increase in equity securities income, and an $8,000 increase in policy loans income. This increase was partially offset by a $61,000 decrease in fixed maturity securities income.\nNet cemetery and mortuary sales increased by $76,000, or 0.7%, to $11,502,000 for 2015, from $11,426,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $249,000 increase in cemetery pre-need and at-need sales. This increase was partially offset by a $173,000 decrease in mortuary at-need sales.\nRealized gains on investments and other assets increased by $483,000, or 25.2%, to $2,401,000 in realized gains for 2015, from $1,918,000 in realized gains for the comparable period in 2014. This increase in realized gains and losses on investments and other assets was primarily due to a $677,000 increase in gains and losses on other assets. This increase was partially offset by a $180,000 decrease in gains and losses on marketable securities, and a $14,000 decrease in gains and losses on fixed maturity securities held to maturity.\nOther than temporary impairments on investments increased by $441,000, or 268.6%, to $605,000 for 2015 from $164,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to a $192,000 increase in impairments on real estate held for investment and mortgage loans, and a $249,000 increase in impairments on marketable securities.\nMortgage fee income increased by $46,588,000, or 36.1%, to $175,727,000 for 2015, from $129,139,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage loan originations and higher secondary gains from mortgage loans sold to investors.\nOther revenues increased by $1,375,000, or 36.7%, to $5,122,000 for 2015 from $3,747,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenues.\nTotal benefits and expenses were $263,339,000, or 93.0% of total revenues, for 2015, as compared to $214,456,000, or 94.5% of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2014.\nDeath benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits increased by an aggregate of $2,912,000, or 6.1%, to $50,762,000 for 2015, from $47,850,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $4,058,000 in death benefits, which was partially offset by decreases of $848,000 in future policy benefits, and $298,000 in surrenders and other policy benefits.\nAmortization of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired decreased by $1,252,000, or 18.2%, to $5,641,000 for 2015, from $6,893,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to improved persistency in the payment of premiums in the traditional life business.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $45,809,000, or 29.6%, to $200,674,000 for 2015, from $154,865,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $22,059,000 increase in commission expenses, an $11,500,000 increase in personnel expenses, a $4,154,000 increase in other expenses, a $3,242,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $1,987,000 increase in costs related to funding mortgage loans, and a $1,715,000 increase in rent and rent related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1,146,000 decrease in advertising expenses. These increased expenses in 2015 were primarily due to the additional costs and expenses associated with the Company's significant increases in the number of mortgage loan originations in 2015.\nInterest expense increased by $1,464,000, or 48.9%, to $4,458,000 for 2015, from $2,994,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in outstanding balances on warehouse lines of credit that are used to fund mortgage loans.\nCost of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries decreased by $50,000, or 2.7%, to $1,803,000 for 2015, from $1,853,000 for the comparable period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortuary at-need sales, which was offset by an increase in cemetery pre-need and at-need sales.\nOther comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 amounted to losses of $761,000 and $49,000, respectively. This decrease of $712,000 in 2015 was primarily the result of a $705,000 unrealized loss in marketable securities.\nRisks\nThe following is a description of the most significant risks facing the Company and how it mitigates those risks:\nLegal and Regulatory Risks. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the Company operates may create additional expenses and risks not anticipated by the Company in developing and pricing its products. Regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits, new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the Company's mortgage sales. Also, the Company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery and mortuary business. The Company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations, thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction, and also by employing underwriting practices that identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks.\nMortgage Industry Risks. Developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets can adversely affect the Company's ability to sell its mortgage loans to investors, which can impact the Company's financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding and servicing any unsold loans.\nThe mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company could realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors. The Company's mortgage subsidiaries may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company's estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities.\nUpon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions. The amounts expensed for loan losses in years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $4,689,000, $6,295,000 and $3,053,000, respectively, and the charge to expense has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balances were $628,000 and $2,806,000, respectively. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of December 31, 2016. There is a risk, however, that future loan losses may exceed the loan loss reserves and allowances.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of $3,184,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than 90 days. Of this amount, $1,829,000 of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings. The Company has not received or recognized any interest income on the $3,184,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than 90 days. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company decreased its allowance for mortgage losses by $99,000 and $31,000, respectively, which was charged to bad debt expense and included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period. The allowances for mortgage loan losses as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,749,000 and $1,848,000, respectively.\nAt various times third party investors have asserted that SecurityNational Mortgage sold mortgage loans that allegedly contained borrower misrepresentations or experienced early payment defaults, or that were otherwise allegedly defective or not in compliance with loan purchase agreements involving SecurityNational Mortgage. As a result of these claims, third party investors have made demands at times that SecurityNational Mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans.\nThe total amount of potential claims by third party investors is difficult to determine. The Company has reserved and accrued $628,000 as of December 31, 2016 to settle all such investor related claims. The Company believes that the reserve for mortgage loan losses, which includes provisions for probable losses and indemnification on mortgage loans sold to investors, is reasonable based on available information. Moreover, the Company has successfully negotiated acceptable settlement terms with other third party investors that asserted claims for mortgage loan losses against SecurityNational Mortgage.\nSecurityNational Mortgage disagrees with the repurchase demands and notices of potential claims from third party investors. Furthermore, SecurityNational Mortgage believes there is potential to resolve the alleged claims by the third-party investors on acceptable terms. If SecurityNational Mortgage is unable to resolve such claims on acceptable terms, legal action may ensue. In the event of legal action by any third-party investor, SecurityNational Mortgage believes it has significant defenses to any such action and intends to vigorously defend itself against such action.\nInterest Rate Risk. The risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the Company's investments or impair the ability of the Company to market its mortgage and cemetery/mortuary products. This change in rates may cause certain interest-sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation. The Company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non-conformance with certain policy provisions, by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser, and by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities. To the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature, the Company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale.\nMortality and Morbidity Risks. The risk that the Company's actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality and morbidity experiences may cause the Company's products to be underpriced, may cause the Company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated, and other potentially adverse consequences to the business. The Company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices, asset and liability duration matching, and sound actuarial practices.\nEstimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term are those used in determining the value of derivative assets and liabilities, those used in determining deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, those used in determining the value of mortgage loans foreclosed to real estate held for investment, those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and unearned revenue, those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre-need sales, those used in determining the value of mortgage servicing rights, those used in determining allowances for loan losses for mortgage loans on real estate, those used in determining loan loss reserve, and those used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are fairly stated in all material respects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums, contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business, from interest and dividends on invested assets, and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments. The mortgage subsidiaries realize cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors. The Company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities, which generally are long-term, and adequate to pay current policyholder claims, annuity payments, expenses related to the issuance of new policies, the maintenance of existing policies, debt service, and to meet current operating expenses.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operations provided cash of $43,860,000. This was primarily due to an increase in cash collected on mortgage loans sold to investors. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company's operations used cash of $15,831,000. This was primarily due to an increase in cash paid on mortgage loans sold to investors.\nThe Company's liability for future life, annuity and other benefits is expected to be paid out over the long-term due to the Company's market niche of selling funeral plans. Funeral plans are small face value life insurance that will pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person's death. A person generally will keep these policies in force and will not surrender them prior to a person's death. Because of the long-term nature of these liabilities, the Company is able to hold to maturity its bonds, real estate and mortgage loans thus reducing the risk of liquidating these long-term investments as a result of any sudden changes in market values.\nThe Company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities. The Company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing. The Company purchases short-term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short-term requirements of the Company's products. The Company's investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return, which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements.\nThe Company's investment policy is also to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities, real estate, mortgage loans, and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short-term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries. Bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to $184,356,000 and $144,946,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This represents 33.1% and 32.9% of the total investments as of December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Generally, all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Under this rating system, there are six categories used for rating bonds. At December 31, 2016, 9.0% (or $16,513,000) and at December 31, 2015, 8.3% (or $11,990,000) of the Company's total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six, which are considered non-investment grade.\nThe Company has classified certain of its fixed income securities, including high-yield securities, in its portfolio as available for sale, with the remainder classified as held to maturity. In accordance with Company policy, however, any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity. Notwithstanding, business conditions may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio. In that event, the Company believes it could sell short-term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer-term securities.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities and for the schedule of principal payments for mortgage loans on real estate and construction loans held for investment.\nIf market conditions were to cause interest rates to change, the market value of the Company's fixed income portfolio, which includes bonds, preferred stock, and mortgage loans, could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing (the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique):\n\nThe Company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets, liabilities, disintermediation, and business risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria.\nThe Company's total capitalization of stockholders' equity, and bank loans and notes payable were $181,898,000 as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $152,155,000 as of December 31, 2015. Stockholders' equity as a percent of total capitalization was 70.5% and 73.1% as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Bank loans and notes payable increased by $12,810,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, thus decreasing the stockholders' equity percentage.\nLapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period. The Company's lapse rate for life insurance was 9.6% in 2016 as compared to a rate of 7.4% for 2015.\nAt December 31, 2016, $44,055,000 of the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity represents the statutory stockholders' equity of the Company's life insurance subsidiaries.

The Company desires to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the act.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, together with related data and projections, about the Company's projected financial results and its future plans and strategies. However, actual results and needs of the Company may vary materially from forward-looking statements and projections made from time to time by the Company on the basis of management's then-current expectations. The business in which the Company is engaged involves changing and competitive markets, which may involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements and projections will prove accurate.\nFactors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted in such forward looking statements include among others, the following possibilities: (i) heightened competition, including the intensification of price competition, the entry of new competitors, and the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors; (ii) adverse state and federal legislation or regulation, including decreases in rates, limitations on premium levels, increases in minimum capital and reserve requirements, benefit mandates and tax treatment of insurance products; (iii) fluctuations in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income or increase in interest expense and in the market value of interest rate sensitive investment; (iv) failure to obtain new customers, retain existing customers or reductions in policies in force by existing customers; (v) higher service, administrative, or general expense due to the need for additional advertising, marketing, administrative or management information systems expenditures; (vi) loss or retirement of key executives or employees; (vii) increases in medical costs; (viii) changes in the Company's liquidity due to changes in asset and liability matching; (ix) restrictions on insurance underwriting based on genetic testing and other criteria; (x) adverse changes in the ratings obtained by independent rating agencies; (xi) failure to maintain adequate reinsurance; (xii) possible claims relating to sales practices for insurance products and claim denials and (xiii) adverse trends in mortality and morbidity; (xiv) deterioration of real estate markets and (xv) lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.\nOff-Balance Sheet Agreements\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating $560,350, to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to additional risk assessments pertaining to the Company's captive insurance program. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit because claims are not expected to exceed premiums paid. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of this letter of credit is zero.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under standby letters of credit aggregating $1,250,000, to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to claims filed in states where the Company's mortgage segment is licensed. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of these standby letters of credit. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of these letters of credit is zero.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating $48,220, issued as a security deposit to guarantee payment of final bills for electric and gas utility services for a commercial real estate property owned by the Company in Wichita, Kansas. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of this letter of credit is zero.\nSecurityNational Mortgage has entered into loan purchase agreements and subsequent amendments to originate and sell mortgage loans to two unaffiliated warehouse banks. On March 19, 2012, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") entered into a loan purchase agreement in which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a warehouse line of up to $55,000,000 to fund certain approved mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage. On December 10, 2015, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo agreed to an amendment to the March 19, 2012 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $55,000,000 to $70,000,000. On June 6, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage and Wells Fargo agreed to another amendment to the March 19, 2012 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $70,000,000 to $100,000,000.\nOn August 14, 2015, SecurityNational Mortgage entered into a loan purchase agreement with Texas Capital Bank.

On September 7, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage and Texas Capital Bank agreed to an amendment to the August 14, 2015 loan purchase agreement to increase the amount of the warehouse line available to fund mortgage loans originated by SecurityNational Mortgage from $30,000,000 to $100,000,000.\nGenerally, when mortgage loans are sold to the warehouse banks, the Company is no longer obligated to pay the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loans, but is required to pay a fee in the form of interest on the mortgage loans between the date the loans are sold to warehouse banks and the settlement date with the third-party investors. The terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year, with interest accruing on the mortgage loans at annual rates ranging from 2.5% to 2.75% over the 30-day Libor rate.\nAs of December 31, 2016, SecurityNational Mortgage had $181,573,000 in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending and EverLEND Mortgage had $-0- in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending.\nThe total of the Company's unfunded residential construction loan and land development loan commitments as of December 31, 2016, was $15,622,000.\nThe Company entered into a Construction Loan Agreement between Key Bank National Association and 5300 Development LLC, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary.

These funds are being used for the construction of phase 1 of the Company's new corporate campus development in Salt Lake City Utah. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has used $8,778,000 of these funds.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, and the payments due by period are shown in the following table:\n\nCasualty Insurance Program\nIn conjunction with the Company's casualty insurance program, limited equity interests are held in a captive insurance entity. This program permits the Company to self-insure a portion of losses, to gain access to a wide array of safety-related services, to pool insurance risks and resources in order to obtain more competitive pricing for administration and reinsurance and to limit its risk of loss in any particular year. The maximum exposure to loss related to the Company's involvement with this entity is limited to approximately $560,350 which is collateralized under a standby letter of credit issued on the insurance entity's behalf.
