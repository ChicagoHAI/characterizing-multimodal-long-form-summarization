Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019.\nAutoliv, Inc. (the Company\u201d) provides automotive safety systems to the automotive industry with a broad range of product offerings, primarily passive safety systems. In the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, a number of factors have influenced the Company's results of operations.

During the past ten years LVP has shown year-over-year growth with the exception of 2019 and 2018. During 2019 we experienced deterioration of market conditions resulting in declines of LVP in all regions. The most significant decline in LVP, came in China due to lower consumer demand for vehicles and new emission regulations, and in Europe from uncertainty around drivetrain choices, public policy changes and declining consumer sentiments. As a result, full-year 2019 global LVP declined by 6%. This came after a 1% decline in 2018.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> Light Vehicle Production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

by 2.4 million units or by 9% from 2018 to 2019. In Europe, an important market for automotive safety systems, LVP decreased by 4% or by approximately 0.9 million light vehicles during the same period. In North America, LVP declined by 4% or 0.7 million light vehicles. Affected by political and macro-economic factors, LVP in India decreased by 12%, to 4.2 million light vehicles in 2019.\nEurope's and the Americas share of global LVP has remained unchanged at 24% and 21%, respectively, while China's share declined from 28% to 27%. Japan's share increased from 10% to 11% as LVP remained steady.\nDue to more stringent crash ratings, by institutes such as EuroNCAP; and increasing consumer demand for more safety in emerging markets, we see vehicle manufacturers installing more airbags and more advanced seatbelt systems in vehicles. This generally takes place when new models are introduced. The safety standards of vehicles are increasing in China, India and other growth markets such as Brazil, partially due to new regulations and crash test rating programs. For example, the Indian government has decided on a new traffic regulation that mandates more rigid crash test standards for light vehicles. This should eventually lead to a higher installation rate of airbags and more advanced seatbelts. In 2019, the decline in LVP was pronounced in markets with lower average safety content per vehicle (CPV) such as China, India and Other Asia, where the CPV is approximately $180, $80 and $160, respectively. These positive trends were in 2019 offset by negative currency translation effects. The average global safety CPV (airbags, seatbelts and steering wheels) was therefore unchanged at around $225. In addition, there is a negative effect from continued pricing pressure from vehicle manufacturers.\nThe more stringent crash ratings and consumer demand for more safety should enable the global automotive safety market to grow faster than the global LVP during the next three years.\nWELL BALANCED GLOBAL FOOTPRINT\nAutoliv's regional sales mix continues to be balanced with 29% of sales in Europe, 34% in the Americas and 37% in Asia in 2019, compared to 32%, 31% and 37%, respectively, in 2018. In Asia, our sales in the important Chinese market remained at 18% of total sales in 2019. Regardless of the weakness in the Chinese market, we remain well positioned in that market, which is the world's largest automotive producing market.\nThe balanced regional sales mix has been achieved through timely investments and strengthening of technical and support capabilities in growth markets and early introduction and execution of our restructuring and capacity alignment activities. To further improve our competitiveness, we have also made substantial investments to increase manufacturing capacity for vertical integration in China and Thailand.\nFor Asia as a whole, the effect of the higher sales in China, Other Asia and India was partly offset by declining sales in Japan.\nThe fastest growing customer from 2018 to 2019 was Honda. Its share of our sales has increased from 8% to 10%. The second largest customer based in Asia is Hyundai/Kia, accounting for 8% of Autoliv sales. The local Chinese OEMs as a group accounted for around 4% of our sales in 2019, with Great Wall representing 2%.\nOur sales to premium brand OEMs accounted for around 17% of total sales in 2019, while their share of global LVP is approximately 12%. Our strong position with premium OEMs reflects the higher safety content in their vehicles along with our position as a technology leader in the automotive safety market.\nThe U.S. based OEMs (including Tesla) account for 21% of our global sales, down from 29% in 2014. This is in part due to the sale of GM's European operations, Opel, to PSA. Tesla now accounts for more than 1% of our 2019 sales.\nCONTINUED STRONG ORDER INTAKE SHARE\nBuilding on a strong base, including supplying products to nearly 1,300 vehicle models and 100 car brands, Autoliv recorded its highest order intake share ever during the past five-year period, winning around 50% of available orders. Our share of order intake in prior years is significantly above our current sales market share of more than 41% in 2019. The order intake is broad based and we have improved our market position in three dimensions - regional, customer and product category. The lead time from order intake to start of production is typically 18-36 months. During this period the products are engineered into the vehicle to provide the expected protection for occupants in case of a crash and to meet legal and regulatory requirements, as well as other requirements from the vehicle manufacturer. This investment in new products is the main reason for the high level of RD&E expenses, net. Additionally, we have to build up production capacity, in the form of new lines, to meet future product launches.\nOur order intake share for 2019 continued on the same high level as in 2018, supporting our growth opportunities also beyond 2020. We estimate that we booked about 50% of available order value in 2019, making 2019 the fifth consecutive year of booking around or more than 50% of available order value. The estimated life-time sales for all orders booked in 2019 is $11.0 billion, compared to $15.1 billion in 2018. 2018 was an exceptional year with sourcing of several large vehicle platforms with a life-time longer than the typical 4 to 6 years. New order intake is defined as the sales value of awards for future business, received within that year. The life time value is calculated using detailed assumptions of price and volumes over the years of production and the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receiving the order.\nDue to the lead time from order to start of production, 2017 was the first year that the increased level of order intake began to impact our sales. Over the last two years, sales have substantially outperformed the change in global LVP. In 2019 and 2018 the outperformance was around 7 pp and 6 pp, respectively. During 2019, growth was positively affected through recent launches of several new models, including Honda CR-V, Tesla Model 3, Audi Q3, Ram Trucks and Volkswagen T-Cross.\nOPERATIONAL INITIATIVES\nAs market weakness has continued in 2019, we have stepped up the cost improvement actions, launching a Structural Efficiency Program, including targeting a reduction of our indirect workforce by approximately 800. The cost for the program is estimated to be approximately $52 million and it is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2020. Annualized savings is estimated to be around $60 million which is equal to about 5% of indirect labor costs.\nThe costs for restructuring activities in 2019 amounted to $54 million compared to $9 million in 2018.\nThe current restructuring activities are expected to have a payback period of around 1 year, after cash-out. The cash payments in 2019 were $30 million compared to $14 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we have $56 million reserved in our balance sheet related to restructuring (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).\nWe continue to actively manage the business cycle downturn as we reduced the total direct workforce by 1,500 in 2019, despite growing our sales organically (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) by 1.2% compared to 2018.\nWith more than 100 improvement projects being evaluated, we have set a high pace in the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives and structural improvements. These initiatives are key drivers to our medium-term target and building the foundation to continue to create shareholder value.\nIMPROVED EFFICIENCIES THROUGH OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nPricing pressure is an inherent part of the automotive supplier business. Price reductions are generally higher on newer products with strong volume growth compared to older products, where both the possibilities to re-design the product to reduce costs and market growth are less. Price reductions can also depend on the business cycle. For the period 2018-2019, we estimate the average reduction of our market prices to have been in the range of 2-4% annually. As described below, to meet these price reductions, we have implemented several programs and taken actions to address our cost structure. Additionally, during the period 2018-2019, we have experienced accumulated raw material commodity costs increase of more than $80 million.\nOur productivity improvement target is to achieve at least 5% savings per year. To meet this target, Autoliv has developed a set of strategies to reduce costs in manufacturing:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Autoliv production system (APS) is based on lean manufacturing methodology which aims to continuously increase output with less resources. APS provides the target conditions and tools to achieve the delivery of goods and services at the right time, in the right amount, at the required quality and at the lowest cost possible to all our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our One Product One Process (1P1P) strategy focuses on product and process standardization and reducing cost and complexity. The 1P1P strategy, combined with initiatives to reduce costs for components from external suppliers, ensures that we continuously optimize our supply base footprint, consolidate purchase volumes to fewer suppliers, improve productivity in our supply chain, standardize components and redesign our products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Strategic Initiatives including Automation, Digitalization, Supply Chain Management Effectiveness and RD&E Effectiveness.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Continuous improvement strategies have enabled productivity improvement above our target of 5% over the last years, except 2018 due to a sharp increase in launch activities. Excluding impact from Force Majeure situation in our plant in Mexico, we have come back to around historical performance during 2019. This is achieved despite the increased launch activities also impacted us during 2019.\nReducing labor costs to offset the price erosion on our products is achieved through continuously implementing productivity improvement programs, expanding production in Best Cost Countries (BCCs) and instituting restructuring and capacity alignment activities. The number of employees in the BCCs in relation to total number of associates remains over 80% in 2019.\nThese initiatives, in combination with our restructuring activities, investment in vertical integration and several other actions, are in place to offset the market price erosion.\nWe foresee opportunities for further productivity on gains from increasing use of automation in our assembly for lean manufacturing processes. Additionally, automated cells typically perform the manufacturing process with reduced variability. This results in greater control and consistency of product quality.\nFOCUS ON QUALITY\nThe number of vehicle recalls in the automotive industry has risen sharply in recent years. From 2015 to 2019, Takata's airbag inflators recall generated a record number of recalls in the automotive industry. We expect overall recall numbers to remain high for years to come and, although we strive for the highest quality in our processes, it cannot be ruled out that we may also be adversely impacted by a future recall.\nQuality has been and always will be our number one priority, and we continue to sharpen our focus in this area. We now hold a market share of more than 41% in passive safety while we have been involved in less than 2% of passive safety recalls in the industry in the past ten years; an important indicator that we are delivering on our quality strategy. For more information see product warranty and recalls in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCHANGES IN COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\nDuring the past five years, we experienced significant changes in our competitive landscape. In 2015, TRW, a key competitor in passive safety, was acquired by German group ZF Friedrichshafen. Combined, the new company is the third-largest passive safety supplier globally. In 2016, Key Safety Systems ( KSS\u201d) was acquired by Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. Beginning in 2014, Takata, our largest competitor at the time, experienced severe issues and recalls related to malfunctioning airbag inflators, leading the company to file for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan. In 2018, Joyson substantially acquired all of Takata's global assets and operations and combined it with KSS, forming the new company JSS.\nEuropean Commission AntitruSt Investigation\nSince 2011, Autoliv was subject to an investigation of anti-competitive behavior among suppliers of occupant safety systems by the European Commission (EC). On March 5, 2019, the EC completed the remaining portion of the investigation and imposed a fine on the Company of \u20ac179 million (approximately $203 million). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company had previously accrued \u20ac184 million (approximately $210 million) with respect to the remaining portion of the investigation. The difference between the actual fine and the accrual is reported in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated statements of net income. The final payment of the actual fine was made in June 2019.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe Company's net debt stood at $1,650 million on December 31, 2019. This was an increase of $31 million compared to December 31, 2018. Total interest bearing debt at December 31, 2019 amounted to $2,094 million, a decrease of $136 million compared to December 31, 2018.\nCash flow from operations was $641 million in 2019 and $591 million in 2018, including discontinued operations. Capital expenditures, net amounted to $476 million in 2019 and $555 million in 2018. During the two-year period 2018-2019, the Company paid dividends of $431 million. After the latest declared dividend of 62 cents per share, the annualized run rate is $216 million, based on the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain a financial leverage commensurate with a strong investment grade credit rating\u201d. The long-term target is to have a leverage ratio (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) of around 1.0 and to be within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. At December 31, 2019, the current leverage ratio is 1.7. The Company monitors its capital structure and the financial markets closely and intends to maintain a high level of financial flexibility while being shareholder friendly.\nAs part of the adjustment of the capital structure, the Company historically has repurchased shares of its common stock. During 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares. At December 31, 2019, the remaining number of shares authorized by the board of directors for repurchase is approximately 3.0 million shares.\nCURRENCY IMPACTS\nThe Company is exposed to around 50 currency pairs, with exposures in excess of $1 million each. We are monitoring our currency exposure but do not hedge currency flows. Rather we strive to have sales and costs in the same currency to reduce the transaction exposure risk. The total net transaction exposure in 2019 was approximately $2.1 billion or 25% of sales. Approximately three quarters of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which is leading to currency translation effects.\nOutlook for 2020\nOur organic sales growth and adjusted operating margin outlook indications for 2020 reflect the continuing high level of uncertainty in the automotive markets and assume that global light vehicle production declines by 2-3% in full year 2020 compared to full year 2019.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> Financial measure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Full year indication\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Organic sales growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted operating margin 1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At least 9.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R,D&E, net % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Below 2019 level\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax rate 2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Around 28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating cash flow2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Above 2019 level\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures, net % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Below 2019 level\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio at year end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within target range\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> Excluding costs for capacity alignments and anti-trust related matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> 2)\n</td> <td> Excluding unusual items.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe forward-looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis.

calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe gross profit for the full year 2019 declined by $127 million and the gross margin declined by 1.2pp compared to 2018. The gross margin was adversely impacted by the decline in global light vehicle production, resulting in a lower utilization of our production assets, raw material headwinds and the social unrest in Matamoros, Mexico. This was offset to some degree by organic growth (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) from launches of new products, which have a lower contribution margin in the early phase of the ramp-up.\nOPERATING INCOME\nOperating income increased by around $40 million to $726 million. The reported operating margin was 8.5% of sales, compared to 7.9% of sales in the prior year. The increase of 0.6pp of sales was mainly due to lower costs for antitrust related matters, reported as Other income (expense), net, partly offset by the lower gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A) expenses increased by $9 million or 0.2pp of sales driven mainly by investments in digitalization and slightly higher legal fees, partly offset by slightly lower personnel costs. Research, Development & Engineering (R,D&E) expenses, net declined by $7 million, mainly due to higher engineering income. In relation to sales, it improved to 4.7% in 2019 from 4.8% in 2018.\nFINANCIAL AND NON-OPERTING ITEMS, NET\nFinancial and non-operating items, net in full year 2019 was $77 million. The increase of $3 million compared to $74 million in full year 2018 was mainly due to higher net interest costs due to higher average net interest bearing debt in 2019.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate of 28.6% was 9.8pp lower than last year primarily due to the 2018 unfavorable tax impact from the antitrust accrual in 2018.\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income attributable to controlling interest from Continuing Operations increased by $85 million compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower cost for antitrust accrual as noted above.\nEarnings per share (EPS), diluted increased by 98 cents where the main drivers were 209 cents from lower costs for capacity alignment, the separation of our business segments and antitrust matters, 108 cents from lower tax partially offset by 213 cents from lower adjusted operating income (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures).\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution in 2019 was 87.4 million compared to 87.3 million in 2018.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures\nIn this annual report we sometimes refer to non-U.S. GAAP measures that we and securities analysts use in measuring Autoliv's performance.\nWe believe that these measures assist investors and management in analyzing trends in the Company's business for the reasons given below. Investors should not consider these non-U.S. GAAP measures as substitutes for, but rather as additions to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-U.S. GAAP measures have been identified, as applicable, in each section of this annual report with tabular presentations provided below, reconciling them to U.S. GAAP.\nIt should be noted that these measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nORGANIC SALES\nWe analyze the Company's sales trends and performance as changes in organic sales growth\u201d, because the Company currently generates approximately three quarters of net sales in currencies other than the reporting currency (i.e. U.S. dollars) and currency rates have proven to be rather volatile. We also use organic sales to reflect the fact that the Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures.\nOrganic sales present the increase or decrease in the overall U.S. dollar net sales on a comparable basis, allowing separate discussions of the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and exchange rates.\nThe following tabular reconciliation presents changes in organic sales growth\u201d as reconciled to the change in total U.S. GAAP net sales.\nCOMPONENTS IN SALES INCREASE/DECREASE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> China\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nOPERATING WORKING CAPITAL\nDue to the need to optimize cash generation to create value for our shareholders, management focuses on operationally derived working capital as defined in the table above.\nThe reconciling items used to derive this measure are, by contrast, managed as part of our overall management of cash and debt, but they are not part of the responsibilities of day-to-day operations management.\nNET DEBT\nAs part of efficiently managing the Company's overall cost of funds, we routinely enter into debt-related derivatives\u201d (DRD) as part of our debt management.\nCreditors and credit rating agencies use net debt adjusted for DRD in their analyses of the Company's debt and therefore we provide this non-U.S. GAAP measure. DRD are fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt. Also included in the DRD is the unamortized fair value adjustment related to discontinued fair value hedges, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt. By adjusting for DRD, the total financial liability of net debt is disclosed without grossing debt up with currency or interest fair values.\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN AND ADJUSTED EPS\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures our management uses to evaluate our business, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature (such as costs related to capacity alignments, costs related to antitrust matters, separation costs, impairment charges and for EPS unusual tax items) and that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and underlying business trends. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including operating margin and EPS.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT EPS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Adjust-\nments1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-\nU.S.\nGAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Adjust-\nments1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-\nU.S.\nGAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin, %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before taxes from Continuing\nOperations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to controlling\ninterest from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital employed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on capital employed, % 2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on total equity, % 3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings per share Continuing\nOperations, diluted 4, 5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total parent shareholders' equity per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> Adjustments for capacity alignments, antitrust matters and separation of our business segments.

credit facilities, are expected to be sufficient to fund Autoliv's anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures and future dividend payments. Cash flow items are presented on a consolidated basis, for 2018 including both Continuing and Discontinued Operations.\nCash provided by operating activities was $641 million in 2019 compared to $591 million in 2018. The net increase compared to previous year was primarily due to higher contribution from changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by the $203 million EU antitrust payment in 2019.\nWhile management of cash and debt is important to the overall business, it is not part of the operational management's day-to-day responsibilities. We therefore focus on operationally derived working capital (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) and have set a policy that the operating working capital should not exceed 10% of the last 12-month net sales.\nAt December 31, 2019, operating working capital for Continuing Operations (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) amounted to $565 million corresponding to 6.6% of net sales compared to $478 million and 5.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Operating working capital excluding the EC antitrust provision, at December 31, 2018, amounted to $688 million, corresponding to 7.9% of net sales.\nDays receivables outstanding (see Glossary and Definitions for definition) were 70 at December 31, 2019, compared to 71 in 2018. Factoring agreements did not have any material effect on days receivables outstanding for 2019 or 2018.\nDays inventory outstanding (see Glossary and Definitions for definition) were 35 at December 31, 2019, compared to 35 in 2018.\nNET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nIn 2019 and 2018 cash used in investing activities amounted to $476 million and $628 million, respectively. In 2019 all cash used for investing activities was attributable to Continuing Operations compared to $486 million of the $628 million in 2018. Our investing activities primarily consists of investments in property, plant and equipment and acquisition of businesses, net of cash. For further information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCash generated by operating activities continued to sufficiently cover capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCapital expenditures, net for Continuing Operations was $476 million in 2019 and $486 million in 2018, corresponding to 5.6% of net sales for both years.\nDepreciation and amortization in Continuing Operations totaled $351 million in 2019 compared to $342 million in 2018.\nDuring the years 2018 and 2019, a majority of our investments were for production capacity to support the high level of new product launches. Major investments were mainly made in Europe, North America, China and Japan.\nIn 2019, expansion of facilities in Europe was commenced for manufacturing of seatbelts and airbags to meet increased demand. In North America, the higher investments were mainly related to production equipment to increase capacity for new program launches and a new technical center. In addition, Asia made large investments to increase manufacturing capacity to support new product launches.\nNET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCash used in financing activities amounted to $338 million and $245 million for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, the net issuance of debt amounted to $31 million; whereas, in 2018 the net issuance of debt amounted to $938 million. In 2019, the Company paid dividends of $217 million, compared to dividends paid of $214 million in 2018. In 2019, the Company made a $203 million payment relating to the EC antitrust investigation. In 2018, the Company capitalized Veoneer with $972 million prior to the spin-off.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of tax audits. At any given time, the Company is undergoing tax audits covering multiple years in several tax jurisdictions. Ultimate outcomes are uncertain but could, in future periods, have a significant impact on the Company's cash flows. See discussions of income taxes under Significant Accounting Policies in this section, Note 2 and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nPENSION ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering nearly half of the U.S. employees. In a prior year, the Company froze participation in the U.S. plans to exclude employees hired after December 31, 2003. Many of the Company's non-U.S. employees are also covered by pension arrangements.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's pension liability (i.e. the actual funded status) for its U.S. and non-U.S. plans was $240 million compared to $198 million one year earlier. The plans had a net unamortized actuarial loss of $115 million recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the Consolidated Statement of Equity at December 31, 2019, compared to $82 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in the actuarial loss was mainly due to a decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The amortization of this loss is expected to be $5 million in 2020.\nThe liability increase in 2019 of $42 million was mainly due to the decrease in discount rates. The liability decrease in 2018 of $9 million was mainly due to the increase in discount rates, partly offset by lower than expected plan assets return.\nPension expense associated with the defined benefit plans was $27 million in 2019, $20 million in 2018 and $29 million in 2017 and is expected to be $27 million in 2020. The increase in pension expense in 2019 of $7 million was mainly due to a prior year decrease in discount rates. The decrease in pension expense in 2018 of $9 million was mainly due to lower amortization of the unrecognized losses resulting from the amendment of the U.S. defined benefit plan.\nThe Company contributed $17 million to its defined benefit plans in 2019, $16 million in 2018 and $13 million in 2017. The Company expects to contribute $19 million to these plans in 2020 and is currently projecting a yearly funding at approximately the same level in the subsequent years.\nFor further information about retirement plans see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nSHAREHOLDER RETURNS\nTotal cash dividends paid were $217 million in 2019 and $214 million in 2018. The Company has raised the dividend from 60 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018 to 62 cents per share in 2019 (see following table). The Board of Directors has declared a dividend of 62 cents per share for both the first and second quarter of 2020. The annualized dividend amount of $217 million, is based on 62 cents per share and the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during 2019 and 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares for cash of $157 million, including commissions. In total, Autoliv has repurchased 44.5 million shares between May 2000 and December 2019 for cash of $2,498 million, including commissions. The maximum number of shares that are available to be purchased under the stock repurchase program at December 31, 2019 is 3.0 million. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase authorization in order to provide management flexibility in the Company's share repurchases. For further information see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> DIVIDENDS PAID\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> Declared.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEQUITY\nDuring 2019, total equity increased by 11.9% or $226 million to $2,122 million. This was mainly due to a net income of $463 million, partly offset by $217 million for dividends to shareholders.\nDuring 2018, total equity decreased by 54.5% or $2,273 million to $1,897 million. This was mainly due to $2,123 million related to the spin-off of Veoneer, $214 million in dividends to shareholders and $150 million currency translation effects. The decrease was partly offset by $184 million from net income.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND RAW MATERIAL PRICES\nInflation has generally not had a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In many growth markets, inflation is relatively high, especially labor inflation. We have managed to offset this negative effect mainly by labor productivity improvements. However, no assurance can be given that this will continue to be possible going forward.\nThe Company has experienced headwind from raw material prices in both 2018 and 2019. During 2018, the headwinds were mainly form high cost for steel. The headwinds in 2019 were mainly coming from higher cost for steel and Nylon 66, used in airbag cushions.\nPERSONNEL\nDuring the past two years, total headcount (permanent employees and temporary personnel) has risen by 1.0% from the beginning of 2018 to 65,200 at the end of 2019. This reflects the strong order intake we have recognized in past quarters, which drive the need for additional manufacturing and R,D&E personnel.\nDuring 2019, headcount decreased by 1,500 people, compared to the 2,200 people increase during 2018.\nAt the end of 2019, 81% of total headcount was in BCC compared to 80% at the beginning of 2018. Furthermore, 71% of total headcount at December 31, 2019 was direct workers in manufacturing compared to 71% at the beginning of 2018, while 10% of total headcount at December 31, 2019 were temporary employees, compared to 12% at the beginning of 2018.\nCompensation to directors and executive officers is reported, as is customary for U.S. public companies, in Autoliv's proxy statement, which will be available to shareholders in March 2020.\nTreasury Activities\nCREDIT ARRANGEMENTS\nIn June 2019, the Company issued and sold \u20ac100 million of 18-month floating rate notes under its EMTN program. The floating rate notes carry a coupon of 3M Euribor +0.50%.\nIn June 2019, the Company also utilized a 3-year loan facility of SEK 1,200 million with a floating interest rate of 3M STIBOR +0.54%.\nIn June 2018, the Company priced and issued 5-year notes for a total of \u20ac500 million in the Eurobond market. The notes carry a coupon of 0.75%.\nIn July 2016, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit facility (RCF) of $1,100 million. The facility, syndicated among 14 banks, originally maturing in July 2021 with two extension options, each for an additional year. The extension options have been used by the Company and the maturity date for the facility has been extended to July 2023. The Company pays a commitment fee on the undrawn amount of 0.1%, representing 35% of the applicable margin, which is 0.275% (given the Company's rating of BBB+\u201d from S&P Global Ratings at December 31, 2018). Borrowings under the facility are unsecured and bear interest based on the relevant LIBOR or IBOR rate.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's unutilized long-term credit facilities were $1.1 billion, represented by the RCF. This facility is not subject to any financial covenants nor is any other substantial financing of Autoliv. The Company had a net debt position (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) at year end 2019 and 2018 of $1,650 million and $1,619 million, respectively.\nIn 2014, the Company issued and sold long-term debt securities in a U.S. Private Placement pursuant to a Note Purchase and Guaranty Agreement dated April 23, 2014, by and among Autoliv ASP Inc., the Company and the purchasers listed therein. As of December 31, 2019, $1,042 million remains outstanding from the 2014 issuance. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, the Company sold receivables and discounted notes related to selected customers. These factoring arrangements increase cash while reducing accounts receivable and customer risks. At December 31, 2019, the Company had received $163 million for sold receivables without recourse and discounted notes with a discount cost of $3 million during the year, compared to $193 million at year-end 2018 with a discount cost of $6 million recorded in Other non-operating items, net.\nIn September 2019, Autoliv's long-term credit rating was downgraded from A- to BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings while maintaining negative outlook on the rating. The company aims to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.\nNUMBER OF SHARES\nAt December 31, 2019, 87.2 million shares were outstanding (net of 15.6 million treasury shares), a 0.12% increase from 87.1 million one year earlier.\nThe number of shares outstanding is expected to increase by 0.4 million when all Restricted Stock Units (RSU) and Performance Shares (PSs) vest and if all stock options (SOs) to key employees are exercised, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nIn total, Autoliv has repurchased 44.5 million shares under its stock repurchase program between May 2000 and December 2019 for cash of $2,498 million, including commissions. The average cost per share for all repurchased shares to date is $56.13. Purchases can be made from time to time as market and business conditions warrant in open market, negotiated or block transactions. There is no expiration date for the repurchase program in order to provide management flexibility in the Company's share repurchases. No stock repurchases were made in 2019.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed-interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension contribution requirements2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-current liabilities reflected on the balance sheet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> Excludes contingent liabilities arising from litigation, arbitration, regulatory actions or income taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> 2)\n</td> <td> Expected contributions for funded and unfunded defined benefit plans exclude payments beyond 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual obligations include debt, lease and purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Non-controlling interest and restructuring obligations are not included in this table. The major employee obligations as a result of restructuring are disclosed in Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nDebt obligations: For material contractual provisions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nFixed-interest obligations: These obligations include interest on debt and credit agreements relating to periods after December 31, 2019, excluding fees on the revolving credit facility and interest on debts with no defined amortization plan.\nOperating lease obligations: These obligations represent the payment obligations (undiscounted cash flows) under leases classified as operating leases. The Company leases certain offices, manufacturing and research buildings, machinery, automobiles, data processing and other equipment. Such operating leases, some of which are non-cancelable and include renewals, expire on various dates. Capital lease obligations are not material. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nUnconditional purchase obligations: There are no unconditional purchase obligations other than short-term obligations related to inventory, services, tooling, and property, plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business.\nPurchase agreements with suppliers entered into in the ordinary course of business do not generally include fixed quantities. Quantities and delivery dates are established in call off plans\u201d accessible electronically for all customers and suppliers involved. Communicated call off plans\u201d for production material from suppliers are normally reflected in equivalent commitments from Autoliv customers.\nPension contribution requirements: The Company sponsors defined benefit plans that cover a significant portion of our U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The pension plans in the U.S. are funded in conformity with the minimum funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Funding for our pension plans in other countries is based upon plan provisions, actuarial recommendations and/or statutory requirements.\nIn 2020, the expected contribution to all plans, including direct payments to retirees, is $19 million, of which the major contribution is $13 million for our U.S. pension plans. Due to volatility associated with future changes in interest rates and plan asset returns, the Company cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing and amounts of future funding requirements, and therefore the above excludes payments beyond 2020. We may elect to make contributions in excess of the minimum funding requirements for the U.S. plans in response to investment performance and changes in interest rates, or when we believe that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on other capital requirements. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOther non-current liabilities reflected on the balance sheet: These consist mainly of local governmental liabilities.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks and Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to several categories of risks. They can broadly be categorized as operational risks, strategic risks and financial risks. Some of the major risks in each category are described below. There are also other risks that could have a material effect on the Company's results and financial position, and the description below is not complete but should be read in conjunction with the discussion of risks described in Item 1A above, which contains a description of our material risks.\nAs described below, the Company has taken several mitigating actions, applied numerous strategies, adopted policies, and introduced control and reporting systems to reduce and mitigate these risks. In addition, the Company from time to time identifies and evaluates emerging or changing risks to the Company in order to ensure that identified risks and related risk management are updated in this fast-moving environment.\nOperational Risks\nLIGHT VEHICLE PRODUCTION\nAround 30% of Autoliv's costs are fixed; therefore, short-term earnings are dependent on sales volumes and highly dependent on capacity utilization in the Company's plants.\nGlobal LVP is an indicator of the Company's sales development. Ultimately, however, sales are determined by the production levels for the individual vehicle models for which Autoliv is a supplier (see Dependence on Customers). The Company's sales are split over several hundred contracts covering almost 1,300 vehicle models. This moderates the effect of changes in vehicle demand of individual countries and regions as well as production issues. The risk of fluctuating sales has also been mitigated by Autoliv's rapid expansion in Asia and other growth markets, which has reduced the Company's former high dependence on sales in Europe to a diversified mix with Europe, the Americas and Asia each accounting for roughly 30% to 40% of our 2019 total sales.\nIt is the Company's strategy to reduce the risk of fluctuating LVP by using a high number of temporary employees instead of permanent employees in direct production. During 2019 and 2018, the level of temporary employees in relation to total headcount in direct production was 11% and 17%, respectively. To reduce the potential impact of unusual fluctuations in the production of vehicle models supplied by the Company - such as during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 - it is also necessary for the Company to be prepared to quickly adapt the level of permanent employees as well as fixed cost production capacity.\nPRICING PRESSURE\nPricing pressure from customers is an inherent part of the automotive components business. The extent of price reductions varies from year to year and takes the form of one time give backs, reductions in direct sales prices or discounted reimbursements for engineering work.\nIn response, Autoliv is continuously engaged in efforts to reduce costs and to provide customers added value by developing new products. Generally, the speed by which these cost-reduction programs generate results will, to a large extent, determine the future profitability of the Company. The various cost-reduction programs are, to a considerable extent, interrelated. This interrelationship makes it difficult to isolate the impact of costs on any single program, therefore, we monitor key measures such as costs in relation to sales and productivity.\nCOMPONENT COSTS\nThe cost of direct materials was approximately 50% of sales in 2019.\nThe main raw materials being used as input material for Autoliv operations are textiles, plastic, steel and non-ferrous metals. Increased headwinds on raw materials in 2019 were primarily caused by a global shortage of Nylon 66 and the effects coming from the import tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum products, impacting the raw material market and creating uncertainty.\nWe take several actions to mitigate raw material price increases, such as competitive sourcing and exploring alternative materials.\nLEGAL\nThe Company is involved from time to time in regulatory, commercial and contractual legal proceedings that may be significant, and the Company's business may suffer as a result of adverse outcomes of current or future legal proceedings. These claims may include, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with the Company's suppliers and customers, intellectual property matters, alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations, governmental investigations, personal injury claims, product liability claims, environmental issues, tax and customs matters, and employment matters.\nA substantial legal liability or adverse regulatory outcome and the substantial cost to defend the litigation or regulatory proceedings may have an adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nNo assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's profitability and consolidated financial position, or that reserves or insurance will mitigate such impact. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nPRODUCT WARRANTY AND RECALLS\nIf our products are alleged to fail to perform as expected or are defective, the Company may be exposed to various claims for damages and compensation. Such claims may result in costs and other losses to the Company even where the relevant product is eventually found to have functioned properly. If a product (actually or allegedly) fails to perform as expected or is defective, we may face warranty and recall claims. If such actual or alleged failure or defect results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage, we may also face product liability and other claims. The Company may experience material warranty, recall, product or other liability claims or losses in the future, and the Company may incur significant cost to defend against such claims. The Company may be required to participate in a recall involving its products. Each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers. Government safety regulators also have policies and practices with respect to recalls. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. In addition, with global platforms and procedures, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly evaluating our quality performance on a global basis. Any one or more quality, warranty or other recall issue(s), including the ones affecting few units and/or having a small financial impact, may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures which may have a severe impact on the Company's operations, such as a temporary or prolonged suspension of new orders or the Company's ability to bid for new business.\nIn addition, over time, there is a risk that the number of vehicles affected by a failure or defect will increase significantly (as would the Company's costs), since our products often use global designs and are increasingly based on or utilize the same or similar parts, components or solutions.\nAlthough quality has always been a central focus in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, our customers and regulators have become increasingly attentive to quality with even less tolerance for any deviations, which has resulted in an increase in the number of automotive recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. A warranty recall or a product liability claim brought against the Company in excess of the Company's insurance may have a material adverse effect on its business and/or financial results. Vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their external suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. A vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold the Company responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the product supplied did not perform as represented. Additionally, a customer may not allow us to bid for expiring or new business until certain remedial steps have been taken. Accordingly, the future costs of warranty claims by the Company's customers may be material.\nThe Company's warranty reserves are based upon management's best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims. Management regularly evaluates the appropriateness of these reserves and adjusts them when we believe it is appropriate to do so. However, the final amounts determined to be due could differ materially from the Company's recorded estimates. We believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements typically seen in our business.\nThe Company's strategy is to follow a stringent procedure when developing new products and technologies and to apply a proactive zero-defect\u201d quality policy (see section Quality Management). In addition, the Company carries insurance for potential recall and product liability claims at coverage levels that management believes are generally sufficient to cover the risks based on the Company's prior claims experience. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover every possible claim that can arise in the Company's businesses, now or in the future, or may not always will be available should the Company, now or in the future, wish to extend, renew, increase or otherwise adjust such insurance. Management's decision regarding what insurance to procure is also impacted by the cost for such insurance. As a result, the Company may face material losses in excess of the insurance coverage procured. A substantial recall or liability in excess of coverage levels could therefore have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nMost of the Company's manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of components. As a result, the environmental impact from the Company's plants is generally modest. While the Company's businesses from time to time are subject to environmental investigations, there are no material environmental-related cases pending against the Company. Therefore, Autoliv does not incur (or expect to incur) any material costs or capital expenditures associated with maintaining facilities compliant with U.S. or non-U.S. environmental requirements. To reduce environmental risk, the Company has implemented an environmental management system in all plants globally and has adopted an environmental policy (see corporate website www.autoliv.com).\nAutoliv is subject to a number of environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such requirements are complex and are generally becoming more stringent over time. There can be no assurance that these requirements will not change in the future, or that we will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements and regulations, despite our intention to be. The Company may also find itself subject, possibly due to changes in legislation or other regulation, to environmental liabilities based on the activities of its predecessor entities or of businesses acquired. Such liability could be based on activities which are not related to the Company's current activities.\nTRADE\nAutoliv is subject to various international trade regulations and regimes and changes in these regimes could lead to increased compliance costs and costs of raw materials and other components. In addition, political conditions leading to trade conflicts and the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers between countries in which we do business could increase our costs of doing business.\nStrategic Risks\nREGULATIONS\nIn addition to vehicle production, the Company's market is driven by the safety content per vehicle, which is affected by new regulations and new vehicle rating programs, in addition to consumer demand for new safety technologies.\nThe most important regulations are the seatbelt installation laws that exist in all vehicle-producing countries. Many countries also have strict enforcement laws on the wearing of seatbelts. Another significant vehicle safety regulation is the U.S. federal law that, since 1997, requires frontal airbags for both the driver and the front-seat passenger in all new vehicles sold in the U.S. In 2007, the U.S. adopted new regulations for side-impact protection which now have been fully phased-in. China introduced a vehicle rating program in 2006, and Latin America introduced a similar program in 2010 followed by ASEAN NCAP in Southeast Asia in 2011. The United States upgraded its vehicle rating program in 2010 and Europe upgraded the Euro NCAP rating system during 2018. Euro NCAP has initiated the next upgrade, which will be fully implemented by 2025. Japan and South Korea are continuously upgrading their respective vehicle rating programs, JNCAP and KNCAP respectively. India requires frontal airbags for the driver for all new passenger vehicles (M1) from July 2019. There are also other plans for improved automotive safety, both in these countries and other countries that could affect the Company's market.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that changes in regulations will not adversely affect the demand for the Company's products or, at least, result in a slower increase in the demand for them.\nDEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS\nIn 2019, the five largest vehicle manufacturers accounted for 51% of global LVP and the ten largest manufacturers for 74%.\nAs a result of this highly consolidated market, the Company is dependent on a relatively small number of customers with strong purchasing power.\nIn 2019, the Company's five largest customers accounted for 52% of revenues and the ten largest customers for 79% of revenues. For a list of the largest customers, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOur largest customer contract accounted for around 2% of sales in 2019. Although business with every major customer is split into at least several contracts (usually one contract per vehicle platform) and although the customer base has become more balanced and diversified as a result of Autoliv's significant expansion in China and other rapidly-growing markets, the loss of all business from a major customer (whether by a cancellation of existing contracts or not awarding Autoliv new business), the consolidation of one or more major customers or a bankruptcy of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, a quality issue, shortcomings in our service to a customer or uncompetitive prices or products could result in the customer not awarding us new business, which will gradually have a negative impact on our sales when current contracts start to expire.\nCUSTOMER PAYMENT RISK\nAnother risk related to our customers is the risk that one or more of our customers will be unable to pay their invoices that become due. We seek to limit this customer payment risk by invoicing our major customers through their local subsidiaries in each country, even for global contracts. By invoicing this way, we attempt to avoid having the receivables with a multinational customer group exposed to the risk that a bankruptcy or similar event in one country would put all receivables with such customer group at risk. In each country, we also monitor invoices becoming overdue.\nEven so, if a major customer is unable to fulfill its payment obligations, it is likely that we would be forced to record a substantial loss on such receivables.\nDEPENDENCE ON SUPPLIERS\nAutoliv relies on internal and/or external suppliers in order to meet its delivery commitments to the customers. In some cases, suppliers are dictated by the customers based on very specific qualification requirements. In other areas, Autoliv is dependent on a single supplier for a specific component. Autoliv supply chain organization is reviewing sourcing risks and actively working on mitigating related supply chain risks.\nAutoliv's ambition is to maintain an optimal number of suppliers in all significant component technologies.\nNEW COMPETITION\nIncreased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and delivery as well as engineering capabilities, technical expertise, product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. To maintain our competitiveness and position as a market leader, it is important to focus on all of these aspects of supplier evaluation and selection.\nAlthough the market for occupant restraint systems has undergone a significant consolidation during the past ten years, the passive safety market remains very competitive. It cannot be excluded that additional competitors, both global and local, will seek to enter the market or grow beyond their current Keiretsu group or traditional customer base. Particularly in China, South Korea and Japan there are numerous small domestic competitors often supplying just one OEM group.\nPATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY\nThe Company's strategy is to protect its innovations with patents, and to vigorously protect and defend its patents, trademarks and know-how against infringement and unauthorized use. At the end of 2019, the Company held more than 6,000 patents. These patents expire on various dates during the period from 2020 to 2039. The expiration of any single patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nAlthough the Company believes that its products and technology do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future. Also, there can be no assurance that any patent now owned by the Company will afford protection against competitors that develop similar technology. As the Company continues to expand its products and expand into new businesses, it will increase its exposure to intellectual property claims.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company is exposed to financial risks through its operations. To reduce the financial risks and to take advantage of economies of scale, the Company has a central treasury department supporting operations and management. The treasury department handles external financial transactions and functions as the Company's in-house bank for its subsidiaries.\nThe Board of Directors monitors compliance with the financial risk policy on an on-going basis. For information about specific financial risks, see", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImportant Trends\nThe discussions and analysis in this section are focused on our continuing operations. For more information on our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Discussions of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 that have been omitted under this item can be found in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019.\nAutoliv, Inc. (the Company\u201d) provides automotive safety systems to the automotive industry with a broad range of product offerings, primarily passive safety systems. In the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, a number of factors have influenced the Company's results of operations.

During the past ten years LVP has shown year-over-year growth with the exception of 2019 and 2018. During 2019 we experienced deterioration of market conditions resulting in declines of LVP in all regions. The most significant decline in LVP, came in China due to lower consumer demand for vehicles and new emission regulations, and in Europe from uncertainty around drivetrain choices, public policy changes and declining consumer sentiments. As a result, full-year 2019 global LVP declined by 6%. This came after a 1% decline in 2018.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> Light Vehicle Production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

by 2.4 million units or by 9% from 2018 to 2019. In Europe, an important market for automotive safety systems, LVP decreased by 4% or by approximately 0.9 million light vehicles during the same period. In North America, LVP declined by 4% or 0.7 million light vehicles. Affected by political and macro-economic factors, LVP in India decreased by 12%, to 4.2 million light vehicles in 2019.\nEurope's and the Americas share of global LVP has remained unchanged at 24% and 21%, respectively, while China's share declined from 28% to 27%. Japan's share increased from 10% to 11% as LVP remained steady.\nDue to more stringent crash ratings, by institutes such as EuroNCAP; and increasing consumer demand for more safety in emerging markets, we see vehicle manufacturers installing more airbags and more advanced seatbelt systems in vehicles. This generally takes place when new models are introduced. The safety standards of vehicles are increasing in China, India and other growth markets such as Brazil, partially due to new regulations and crash test rating programs. For example, the Indian government has decided on a new traffic regulation that mandates more rigid crash test standards for light vehicles. This should eventually lead to a higher installation rate of airbags and more advanced seatbelts. In 2019, the decline in LVP was pronounced in markets with lower average safety content per vehicle (CPV) such as China, India and Other Asia, where the CPV is approximately $180, $80 and $160, respectively. These positive trends were in 2019 offset by negative currency translation effects. The average global safety CPV (airbags, seatbelts and steering wheels) was therefore unchanged at around $225. In addition, there is a negative effect from continued pricing pressure from vehicle manufacturers.\nThe more stringent crash ratings and consumer demand for more safety should enable the global automotive safety market to grow faster than the global LVP during the next three years.\nWELL BALANCED GLOBAL FOOTPRINT\nAutoliv's regional sales mix continues to be balanced with 29% of sales in Europe, 34% in the Americas and 37% in Asia in 2019, compared to 32%, 31% and 37%, respectively, in 2018. In Asia, our sales in the important Chinese market remained at 18% of total sales in 2019. Regardless of the weakness in the Chinese market, we remain well positioned in that market, which is the world's largest automotive producing market.\nThe balanced regional sales mix has been achieved through timely investments and strengthening of technical and support capabilities in growth markets and early introduction and execution of our restructuring and capacity alignment activities. To further improve our competitiveness, we have also made substantial investments to increase manufacturing capacity for vertical integration in China and Thailand.\nFor Asia as a whole, the effect of the higher sales in China, Other Asia and India was partly offset by declining sales in Japan.\nThe fastest growing customer from 2018 to 2019 was Honda. Its share of our sales has increased from 8% to 10%. The second largest customer based in Asia is Hyundai/Kia, accounting for 8% of Autoliv sales. The local Chinese OEMs as a group accounted for around 4% of our sales in 2019, with Great Wall representing 2%.\nOur sales to premium brand OEMs accounted for around 17% of total sales in 2019, while their share of global LVP is approximately 12%. Our strong position with premium OEMs reflects the higher safety content in their vehicles along with our position as a technology leader in the automotive safety market.\nThe U.S. based OEMs (including Tesla) account for 21% of our global sales, down from 29% in 2014. This is in part due to the sale of GM's European operations, Opel, to PSA. Tesla now accounts for more than 1% of our 2019 sales.\nCONTINUED STRONG ORDER INTAKE SHARE\nBuilding on a strong base, including supplying products to nearly 1,300 vehicle models and 100 car brands, Autoliv recorded its highest order intake share ever during the past five-year period, winning around 50% of available orders. Our share of order intake in prior years is significantly above our current sales market share of more than 41% in 2019. The order intake is broad based and we have improved our market position in three dimensions - regional, customer and product category. The lead time from order intake to start of production is typically 18-36 months. During this period the products are engineered into the vehicle to provide the expected protection for occupants in case of a crash and to meet legal and regulatory requirements, as well as other requirements from the vehicle manufacturer. This investment in new products is the main reason for the high level of RD&E expenses, net. Additionally, we have to build up production capacity, in the form of new lines, to meet future product launches.\nOur order intake share for 2019 continued on the same high level as in 2018, supporting our growth opportunities also beyond 2020. We estimate that we booked about 50% of available order value in 2019, making 2019 the fifth consecutive year of booking around or more than 50% of available order value. The estimated life-time sales for all orders booked in 2019 is $11.0 billion, compared to $15.1 billion in 2018. 2018 was an exceptional year with sourcing of several large vehicle platforms with a life-time longer than the typical 4 to 6 years. New order intake is defined as the sales value of awards for future business, received within that year. The life time value is calculated using detailed assumptions of price and volumes over the years of production and the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receiving the order.\nDue to the lead time from order to start of production, 2017 was the first year that the increased level of order intake began to impact our sales. Over the last two years, sales have substantially outperformed the change in global LVP. In 2019 and 2018 the outperformance was around 7 pp and 6 pp, respectively. During 2019, growth was positively affected through recent launches of several new models, including Honda CR-V, Tesla Model 3, Audi Q3, Ram Trucks and Volkswagen T-Cross.\nOPERATIONAL INITIATIVES\nAs market weakness has continued in 2019, we have stepped up the cost improvement actions, launching a Structural Efficiency Program, including targeting a reduction of our indirect workforce by approximately 800. The cost for the program is estimated to be approximately $52 million and it is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2020. Annualized savings is estimated to be around $60 million which is equal to about 5% of indirect labor costs.\nThe costs for restructuring activities in 2019 amounted to $54 million compared to $9 million in 2018.\nThe current restructuring activities are expected to have a payback period of around 1 year, after cash-out. The cash payments in 2019 were $30 million compared to $14 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we have $56 million reserved in our balance sheet related to restructuring (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).\nWe continue to actively manage the business cycle downturn as we reduced the total direct workforce by 1,500 in 2019, despite growing our sales organically (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) by 1.2% compared to 2018.\nWith more than 100 improvement projects being evaluated, we have set a high pace in the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives and structural improvements. These initiatives are key drivers to our medium-term target and building the foundation to continue to create shareholder value.\nIMPROVED EFFICIENCIES THROUGH OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nPricing pressure is an inherent part of the automotive supplier business. Price reductions are generally higher on newer products with strong volume growth compared to older products, where both the possibilities to re-design the product to reduce costs and market growth are less. Price reductions can also depend on the business cycle. For the period 2018-2019, we estimate the average reduction of our market prices to have been in the range of 2-4% annually. As described below, to meet these price reductions, we have implemented several programs and taken actions to address our cost structure. Additionally, during the period 2018-2019, we have experienced accumulated raw material commodity costs increase of more than $80 million.\nOur productivity improvement target is to achieve at least 5% savings per year. To meet this target, Autoliv has developed a set of strategies to reduce costs in manufacturing:\n \u2022 Autoliv production system (APS) is based on lean manufacturing methodology which aims to continuously increase output with less resources. APS provides the target conditions and tools to achieve the delivery of goods and services at the right time, in the right amount, at the required quality and at the lowest cost possible to all our customers. \n \u2022 Our One Product One Process (1P1P) strategy focuses on product and process standardization and reducing cost and complexity. The 1P1P strategy, combined with initiatives to reduce costs for components from external suppliers, ensures that we continuously optimize our supply base footprint, consolidate purchase volumes to fewer suppliers, improve productivity in our supply chain, standardize components and redesign our products. \n \u2022 Strategic Initiatives including Automation, Digitalization, Supply Chain Management Effectiveness and RD&E Effectiveness. \nOur Continuous improvement strategies have enabled productivity improvement above our target of 5% over the last years, except 2018 due to a sharp increase in launch activities. Excluding impact from Force Majeure situation in our plant in Mexico, we have come back to around historical performance during 2019. This is achieved despite the increased launch activities also impacted us during 2019.\nReducing labor costs to offset the price erosion on our products is achieved through continuously implementing productivity improvement programs, expanding production in Best Cost Countries (BCCs) and instituting restructuring and capacity alignment activities. The number of employees in the BCCs in relation to total number of associates remains over 80% in 2019.\nThese initiatives, in combination with our restructuring activities, investment in vertical integration and several other actions, are in place to offset the market price erosion.\nWe foresee opportunities for further productivity on gains from increasing use of automation in our assembly for lean manufacturing processes. Additionally, automated cells typically perform the manufacturing process with reduced variability. This results in greater control and consistency of product quality.\nFOCUS ON QUALITY\nThe number of vehicle recalls in the automotive industry has risen sharply in recent years. From 2015 to 2019, Takata's airbag inflators recall generated a record number of recalls in the automotive industry. We expect overall recall numbers to remain high for years to come and, although we strive for the highest quality in our processes, it cannot be ruled out that we may also be adversely impacted by a future recall.\nQuality has been and always will be our number one priority, and we continue to sharpen our focus in this area. We now hold a market share of more than 41% in passive safety while we have been involved in less than 2% of passive safety recalls in the industry in the past ten years; an important indicator that we are delivering on our quality strategy. For more information see product warranty and recalls in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCHANGES IN COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\nDuring the past five years, we experienced significant changes in our competitive landscape. In 2015, TRW, a key competitor in passive safety, was acquired by German group ZF Friedrichshafen. Combined, the new company is the third-largest passive safety supplier globally. In 2016, Key Safety Systems ( KSS\u201d) was acquired by Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. Beginning in 2014, Takata, our largest competitor at the time, experienced severe issues and recalls related to malfunctioning airbag inflators, leading the company to file for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan. In 2018, Joyson substantially acquired all of Takata's global assets and operations and combined it with KSS, forming the new company JSS.\nEuropean Commission AntitruSt Investigation\nSince 2011, Autoliv was subject to an investigation of anti-competitive behavior among suppliers of occupant safety systems by the European Commission (EC). On March 5, 2019, the EC completed the remaining portion of the investigation and imposed a fine on the Company of \u20ac179 million (approximately $203 million). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company had previously accrued \u20ac184 million (approximately $210 million) with respect to the remaining portion of the investigation. The difference between the actual fine and the accrual is reported in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated statements of net income. The final payment of the actual fine was made in June 2019.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe Company's net debt stood at $1,650 million on December 31, 2019. This was an increase of $31 million compared to December 31, 2018. Total interest bearing debt at December 31, 2019 amounted to $2,094 million, a decrease of $136 million compared to December 31, 2018.\nCash flow from operations was $641 million in 2019 and $591 million in 2018, including discontinued operations. Capital expenditures, net amounted to $476 million in 2019 and $555 million in 2018. During the two-year period 2018-2019, the Company paid dividends of $431 million. After the latest declared dividend of 62 cents per share, the annualized run rate is $216 million, based on the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain a financial leverage commensurate with a strong investment grade credit rating\u201d. The long-term target is to have a leverage ratio (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) of around 1.0 and to be within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. At December 31, 2019, the current leverage ratio is 1.7. The Company monitors its capital structure and the financial markets closely and intends to maintain a high level of financial flexibility while being shareholder friendly.\nAs part of the adjustment of the capital structure, the Company historically has repurchased shares of its common stock. During 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares. At December 31, 2019, the remaining number of shares authorized by the board of directors for repurchase is approximately 3.0 million shares.\nCURRENCY IMPACTS\nThe Company is exposed to around 50 currency pairs, with exposures in excess of $1 million each. We are monitoring our currency exposure but do not hedge currency flows. Rather we strive to have sales and costs in the same currency to reduce the transaction exposure risk. The total net transaction exposure in 2019 was approximately $2.1 billion or 25% of sales. Approximately three quarters of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which is leading to currency translation effects.\nOutlook for 2020\nOur organic sales growth and adjusted operating margin outlook indications for 2020 reflect the continuing high level of uncertainty in the automotive markets and assume that global light vehicle production declines by 2-3% in full year 2020 compared to full year 2019.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> Financial measure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Full year indication\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Organic sales growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted operating margin 1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At least 9.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R,D&E, net % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Below 2019 level\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax rate 2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Around 28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating cash flow2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Above 2019 level\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures, net % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Below 2019 level\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio at year end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within target range\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1) Excluding costs for capacity alignments and anti-trust related matters. \n 2) Excluding unusual items. \nThe forward-looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis.

equivalents are (under the two-class method) excluded from the EPS calculation. \nGROSS PROFIT\nThe gross profit for the full year 2019 declined by $127 million and the gross margin declined by 1.2pp compared to 2018. The gross margin was adversely impacted by the decline in global light vehicle production, resulting in a lower utilization of our production assets, raw material headwinds and the social unrest in Matamoros, Mexico. This was offset to some degree by organic growth (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) from launches of new products, which have a lower contribution margin in the early phase of the ramp-up.\nOPERATING INCOME\nOperating income increased by around $40 million to $726 million. The reported operating margin was 8.5% of sales, compared to 7.9% of sales in the prior year. The increase of 0.6pp of sales was mainly due to lower costs for antitrust related matters, reported as Other income (expense), net, partly offset by the lower gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A) expenses increased by $9 million or 0.2pp of sales driven mainly by investments in digitalization and slightly higher legal fees, partly offset by slightly lower personnel costs. Research, Development & Engineering (R,D&E) expenses, net declined by $7 million, mainly due to higher engineering income. In relation to sales, it improved to 4.7% in 2019 from 4.8% in 2018.\nFINANCIAL AND NON-OPERTING ITEMS, NET\nFinancial and non-operating items, net in full year 2019 was $77 million. The increase of $3 million compared to $74 million in full year 2018 was mainly due to higher net interest costs due to higher average net interest bearing debt in 2019.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate of 28.6% was 9.8pp lower than last year primarily due to the 2018 unfavorable tax impact from the antitrust accrual in 2018.\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income attributable to controlling interest from Continuing Operations increased by $85 million compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower cost for antitrust accrual as noted above.\nEarnings per share (EPS), diluted increased by 98 cents where the main drivers were 209 cents from lower costs for capacity alignment, the separation of our business segments and antitrust matters, 108 cents from lower tax partially offset by 213 cents from lower adjusted operating income (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures).\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution in 2019 was 87.4 million compared to 87.3 million in 2018.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures\nIn this annual report we sometimes refer to non-U.S. GAAP measures that we and securities analysts use in measuring Autoliv's performance.\nWe believe that these measures assist investors and management in analyzing trends in the Company's business for the reasons given below. Investors should not consider these non-U.S. GAAP measures as substitutes for, but rather as additions to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-U.S. GAAP measures have been identified, as applicable, in each section of this annual report with tabular presentations provided below, reconciling them to U.S. GAAP.\nIt should be noted that these measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nORGANIC SALES\nWe analyze the Company's sales trends and performance as changes in organic sales growth\u201d, because the Company currently generates approximately three quarters of net sales in currencies other than the reporting currency (i.e. U.S. dollars) and currency rates have proven to be rather volatile. We also use organic sales to reflect the fact that the Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures.\nOrganic sales present the increase or decrease in the overall U.S. dollar net sales on a comparable basis, allowing separate discussions of the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and exchange rates.\nThe following tabular reconciliation presents changes in organic sales growth\u201d as reconciled to the change in total U.S. GAAP net sales.\nCOMPONENTS IN SALES INCREASE/DECREASE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> China\n</td> <td>\n</td>

derived working capital as defined in the table above.\nThe reconciling items used to derive this measure are, by contrast, managed as part of our overall management of cash and debt, but they are not part of the responsibilities of day-to-day operations management.\nNET DEBT\nAs part of efficiently managing the Company's overall cost of funds, we routinely enter into debt-related derivatives\u201d (DRD) as part of our debt management.\nCreditors and credit rating agencies use net debt adjusted for DRD in their analyses of the Company's debt and therefore we provide this non-U.S. GAAP measure. DRD are fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt. Also included in the DRD is the unamortized fair value adjustment related to discontinued fair value hedges, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt. By adjusting for DRD, the total financial liability of net debt is disclosed without grossing debt up with currency or interest fair values.\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN AND ADJUSTED EPS\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures our management uses to evaluate our business, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature (such as costs related to capacity alignments, costs related to antitrust matters, separation costs, impairment charges and for EPS unusual tax items) and that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and underlying business trends. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including operating margin and EPS.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT EPS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Adjust-\nments1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-\nU.S.\nGAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Adjust-\nments1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-\nU.S.\nGAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin, %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before taxes from Continuing\nOperations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to controlling\ninterest from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital employed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on capital employed, % 2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on total equity, % 3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings per share Continuing\nOperations, diluted 4, 5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total parent shareholders' equity per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1) Adjustments for capacity alignments, antitrust matters and separation of our business segments.

facilities, are expected to be sufficient to fund Autoliv's anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures and future dividend payments. Cash flow items are presented on a consolidated basis, for 2018 including both Continuing and Discontinued Operations.\nCash provided by operating activities was $641 million in 2019 compared to $591 million in 2018. The net increase compared to previous year was primarily due to higher contribution from changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by the $203 million EU antitrust payment in 2019.\nWhile management of cash and debt is important to the overall business, it is not part of the operational management's day-to-day responsibilities. We therefore focus on operationally derived working capital (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) and have set a policy that the operating working capital should not exceed 10% of the last 12-month net sales.\nAt December 31, 2019, operating working capital for Continuing Operations (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) amounted to $565 million corresponding to 6.6% of net sales compared to $478 million and 5.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Operating working capital excluding the EC antitrust provision, at December 31, 2018, amounted to $688 million, corresponding to 7.9% of net sales.\nDays receivables outstanding (see Glossary and Definitions for definition) were 70 at December 31, 2019, compared to 71 in 2018. Factoring agreements did not have any material effect on days receivables outstanding for 2019 or 2018.\nDays inventory outstanding (see Glossary and Definitions for definition) were 35 at December 31, 2019, compared to 35 in 2018.\nNET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nIn 2019 and 2018 cash used in investing activities amounted to $476 million and $628 million, respectively. In 2019 all cash used for investing activities was attributable to Continuing Operations compared to $486 million of the $628 million in 2018. Our investing activities primarily consists of investments in property, plant and equipment and acquisition of businesses, net of cash. For further information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCash generated by operating activities continued to sufficiently cover capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCapital expenditures, net for Continuing Operations was $476 million in 2019 and $486 million in 2018, corresponding to 5.6% of net sales for both years.\nDepreciation and amortization in Continuing Operations totaled $351 million in 2019 compared to $342 million in 2018.\nDuring the years 2018 and 2019, a majority of our investments were for production capacity to support the high level of new product launches. Major investments were mainly made in Europe, North America, China and Japan.\nIn 2019, expansion of facilities in Europe was commenced for manufacturing of seatbelts and airbags to meet increased demand. In North America, the higher investments were mainly related to production equipment to increase capacity for new program launches and a new technical center. In addition, Asia made large investments to increase manufacturing capacity to support new product launches.\nNET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCash used in financing activities amounted to $338 million and $245 million for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, the net issuance of debt amounted to $31 million; whereas, in 2018 the net issuance of debt amounted to $938 million. In 2019, the Company paid dividends of $217 million, compared to dividends paid of $214 million in 2018. In 2019, the Company made a $203 million payment relating to the EC antitrust investigation. In 2018, the Company capitalized Veoneer with $972 million prior to the spin-off.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of tax audits. At any given time, the Company is undergoing tax audits covering multiple years in several tax jurisdictions. Ultimate outcomes are uncertain but could, in future periods, have a significant impact on the Company's cash flows. See discussions of income taxes under Significant Accounting Policies in this section, Note 2 and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nPENSION ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering nearly half of the U.S. employees. In a prior year, the Company froze participation in the U.S. plans to exclude employees hired after December 31, 2003. Many of the Company's non-U.S. employees are also covered by pension arrangements.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's pension liability (i.e. the actual funded status) for its U.S. and non-U.S. plans was $240 million compared to $198 million one year earlier. The plans had a net unamortized actuarial loss of $115 million recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the Consolidated Statement of Equity at December 31, 2019, compared to $82 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in the actuarial loss was mainly due to a decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The amortization of this loss is expected to be $5 million in 2020.\nThe liability increase in 2019 of $42 million was mainly due to the decrease in discount rates. The liability decrease in 2018 of $9 million was mainly due to the increase in discount rates, partly offset by lower than expected plan assets return.\nPension expense associated with the defined benefit plans was $27 million in 2019, $20 million in 2018 and $29 million in 2017 and is expected to be $27 million in 2020. The increase in pension expense in 2019 of $7 million was mainly due to a prior year decrease in discount rates. The decrease in pension expense in 2018 of $9 million was mainly due to lower amortization of the unrecognized losses resulting from the amendment of the U.S. defined benefit plan.\nThe Company contributed $17 million to its defined benefit plans in 2019, $16 million in 2018 and $13 million in 2017. The Company expects to contribute $19 million to these plans in 2020 and is currently projecting a yearly funding at approximately the same level in the subsequent years.\nFor further information about retirement plans see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nSHAREHOLDER RETURNS\nTotal cash dividends paid were $217 million in 2019 and $214 million in 2018. The Company has raised the dividend from 60 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018 to 62 cents per share in 2019 (see following table). The Board of Directors has declared a dividend of 62 cents per share for both the first and second quarter of 2020. The annualized dividend amount of $217 million, is based on 62 cents per share and the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during 2019 and 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares for cash of $157 million, including commissions. In total, Autoliv has repurchased 44.5 million shares between May 2000 and December 2019 for cash of $2,498 million, including commissions. The maximum number of shares that are available to be purchased under the stock repurchase program at December 31, 2019 is 3.0 million. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase authorization in order to provide management flexibility in the Company's share repurchases. For further information see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> DIVIDENDS PAID\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1st Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4th Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1) Declared. \nEQUITY\nDuring 2019, total equity increased by 11.9% or $226 million to $2,122 million. This was mainly due to a net income of $463 million, partly offset by $217 million for dividends to shareholders.\nDuring 2018, total equity decreased by 54.5% or $2,273 million to $1,897 million. This was mainly due to $2,123 million related to the spin-off of Veoneer, $214 million in dividends to shareholders and $150 million currency translation effects. The decrease was partly offset by $184 million from net income.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND RAW MATERIAL PRICES\nInflation has generally not had a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In many growth markets, inflation is relatively high, especially labor inflation. We have managed to offset this negative effect mainly by labor productivity improvements. However, no assurance can be given that this will continue to be possible going forward.\nThe Company has experienced headwind from raw material prices in both 2018 and 2019. During 2018, the headwinds were mainly form high cost for steel. The headwinds in 2019 were mainly coming from higher cost for steel and Nylon 66, used in airbag cushions.\nPERSONNEL\nDuring the past two years, total headcount (permanent employees and temporary personnel) has risen by 1.0% from the beginning of 2018 to 65,200 at the end of 2019. This reflects the strong order intake we have recognized in past quarters, which drive the need for additional manufacturing and R,D&E personnel.\nDuring 2019, headcount decreased by 1,500 people, compared to the 2,200 people increase during 2018.\nAt the end of 2019, 81% of total headcount was in BCC compared to 80% at the beginning of 2018. Furthermore, 71% of total headcount at December 31, 2019 was direct workers in manufacturing compared to 71% at the beginning of 2018, while 10% of total headcount at December 31, 2019 were temporary employees, compared to 12% at the beginning of 2018.\nCompensation to directors and executive officers is reported, as is customary for U.S. public companies, in Autoliv's proxy statement, which will be available to shareholders in March 2020.\nTreasury Activities\nCREDIT ARRANGEMENTS\nIn June 2019, the Company issued and sold \u20ac100 million of 18-month floating rate notes under its EMTN program. The floating rate notes carry a coupon of 3M Euribor +0.50%.\nIn June 2019, the Company also utilized a 3-year loan facility of SEK 1,200 million with a floating interest rate of 3M STIBOR +0.54%.\nIn June 2018, the Company priced and issued 5-year notes for a total of \u20ac500 million in the Eurobond market. The notes carry a coupon of 0.75%.\nIn July 2016, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit facility (RCF) of $1,100 million. The facility, syndicated among 14 banks, originally maturing in July 2021 with two extension options, each for an additional year. The extension options have been used by the Company and the maturity date for the facility has been extended to July 2023. The Company pays a commitment fee on the undrawn amount of 0.1%, representing 35% of the applicable margin, which is 0.275% (given the Company's rating of BBB+\u201d from S&P Global Ratings at December 31, 2018). Borrowings under the facility are unsecured and bear interest based on the relevant LIBOR or IBOR rate.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's unutilized long-term credit facilities were $1.1 billion, represented by the RCF. This facility is not subject to any financial covenants nor is any other substantial financing of Autoliv. The Company had a net debt position (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) at year end 2019 and 2018 of $1,650 million and $1,619 million, respectively.\nIn 2014, the Company issued and sold long-term debt securities in a U.S. Private Placement pursuant to a Note Purchase and Guaranty Agreement dated April 23, 2014, by and among Autoliv ASP Inc., the Company and the purchasers listed therein. As of December 31, 2019, $1,042 million remains outstanding from the 2014 issuance. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, the Company sold receivables and discounted notes related to selected customers. These factoring arrangements increase cash while reducing accounts receivable and customer risks. At December 31, 2019, the Company had received $163 million for sold receivables without recourse and discounted notes with a discount cost of $3 million during the year, compared to $193 million at year-end 2018 with a discount cost of $6 million recorded in Other non-operating items, net.\nIn September 2019, Autoliv's long-term credit rating was downgraded from A- to BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings while maintaining negative outlook on the rating. The company aims to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.\nNUMBER OF SHARES\nAt December 31, 2019, 87.2 million shares were outstanding (net of 15.6 million treasury shares), a 0.12% increase from 87.1 million one year earlier.\nThe number of shares outstanding is expected to increase by 0.4 million when all Restricted Stock Units (RSU) and Performance Shares (PSs) vest and if all stock options (SOs) to key employees are exercised, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nIn total, Autoliv has repurchased 44.5 million shares under its stock repurchase program between May 2000 and December 2019 for cash of $2,498 million, including commissions. The average cost per share for all repurchased shares to date is $56.13. Purchases can be made from time to time as market and business conditions warrant in open market, negotiated or block transactions. There is no expiration date for the repurchase program in order to provide management flexibility in the Company's share repurchases. No stock repurchases were made in 2019.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed-interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension contribution requirements2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-current liabilities reflected on the balance sheet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1) Excludes contingent liabilities arising from litigation, arbitration, regulatory actions or income taxes. \n 2) Expected contributions for funded and unfunded defined benefit plans exclude payments beyond 2019. \nContractual obligations include debt, lease and purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Non-controlling interest and restructuring obligations are not included in this table. The major employee obligations as a result of restructuring are disclosed in Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nDebt obligations: For material contractual provisions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nFixed-interest obligations: These obligations include interest on debt and credit agreements relating to periods after December 31, 2019, excluding fees on the revolving credit facility and interest on debts with no defined amortization plan.\nOperating lease obligations: These obligations represent the payment obligations (undiscounted cash flows) under leases classified as operating leases. The Company leases certain offices, manufacturing and research buildings, machinery, automobiles, data processing and other equipment. Such operating leases, some of which are non-cancelable and include renewals, expire on various dates. Capital lease obligations are not material. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nUnconditional purchase obligations: There are no unconditional purchase obligations other than short-term obligations related to inventory, services, tooling, and property, plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business.\nPurchase agreements with suppliers entered into in the ordinary course of business do not generally include fixed quantities. Quantities and delivery dates are established in call off plans\u201d accessible electronically for all customers and suppliers involved. Communicated call off plans\u201d for production material from suppliers are normally reflected in equivalent commitments from Autoliv customers.\nPension contribution requirements: The Company sponsors defined benefit plans that cover a significant portion of our U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The pension plans in the U.S. are funded in conformity with the minimum funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Funding for our pension plans in other countries is based upon plan provisions, actuarial recommendations and/or statutory requirements.\nIn 2020, the expected contribution to all plans, including direct payments to retirees, is $19 million, of which the major contribution is $13 million for our U.S. pension plans. Due to volatility associated with future changes in interest rates and plan asset returns, the Company cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing and amounts of future funding requirements, and therefore the above excludes payments beyond 2020. We may elect to make contributions in excess of the minimum funding requirements for the U.S. plans in response to investment performance and changes in interest rates, or when we believe that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on other capital requirements. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOther non-current liabilities reflected on the balance sheet: These consist mainly of local governmental liabilities.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks and Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to several categories of risks. They can broadly be categorized as operational risks, strategic risks and financial risks. Some of the major risks in each category are described below. There are also other risks that could have a material effect on the Company's results and financial position, and the description below is not complete but should be read in conjunction with the discussion of risks described in Item 1A above, which contains a description of our material risks.\nAs described below, the Company has taken several mitigating actions, applied numerous strategies, adopted policies, and introduced control and reporting systems to reduce and mitigate these risks. In addition, the Company from time to time identifies and evaluates emerging or changing risks to the Company in order to ensure that identified risks and related risk management are updated in this fast-moving environment.\nOperational Risks\nLIGHT VEHICLE PRODUCTION\nAround 30% of Autoliv's costs are fixed; therefore, short-term earnings are dependent on sales volumes and highly dependent on capacity utilization in the Company's plants.\nGlobal LVP is an indicator of the Company's sales development. Ultimately, however, sales are determined by the production levels for the individual vehicle models for which Autoliv is a supplier (see Dependence on Customers). The Company's sales are split over several hundred contracts covering almost 1,300 vehicle models. This moderates the effect of changes in vehicle demand of individual countries and regions as well as production issues. The risk of fluctuating sales has also been mitigated by Autoliv's rapid expansion in Asia and other growth markets, which has reduced the Company's former high dependence on sales in Europe to a diversified mix with Europe, the Americas and Asia each accounting for roughly 30% to 40% of our 2019 total sales.\nIt is the Company's strategy to reduce the risk of fluctuating LVP by using a high number of temporary employees instead of permanent employees in direct production. During 2019 and 2018, the level of temporary employees in relation to total headcount in direct production was 11% and 17%, respectively. To reduce the potential impact of unusual fluctuations in the production of vehicle models supplied by the Company - such as during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 - it is also necessary for the Company to be prepared to quickly adapt the level of permanent employees as well as fixed cost production capacity.\nPRICING PRESSURE\nPricing pressure from customers is an inherent part of the automotive components business. The extent of price reductions varies from year to year and takes the form of one time give backs, reductions in direct sales prices or discounted reimbursements for engineering work.\nIn response, Autoliv is continuously engaged in efforts to reduce costs and to provide customers added value by developing new products. Generally, the speed by which these cost-reduction programs generate results will, to a large extent, determine the future profitability of the Company. The various cost-reduction programs are, to a considerable extent, interrelated. This interrelationship makes it difficult to isolate the impact of costs on any single program, therefore, we monitor key measures such as costs in relation to sales and productivity.\nCOMPONENT COSTS\nThe cost of direct materials was approximately 50% of sales in 2019.\nThe main raw materials being used as input material for Autoliv operations are textiles, plastic, steel and non-ferrous metals. Increased headwinds on raw materials in 2019 were primarily caused by a global shortage of Nylon 66 and the effects coming from the import tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum products, impacting the raw material market and creating uncertainty.\nWe take several actions to mitigate raw material price increases, such as competitive sourcing and exploring alternative materials.\nLEGAL\nThe Company is involved from time to time in regulatory, commercial and contractual legal proceedings that may be significant, and the Company's business may suffer as a result of adverse outcomes of current or future legal proceedings. These claims may include, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with the Company's suppliers and customers, intellectual property matters, alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations, governmental investigations, personal injury claims, product liability claims, environmental issues, tax and customs matters, and employment matters.\nA substantial legal liability or adverse regulatory outcome and the substantial cost to defend the litigation or regulatory proceedings may have an adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nNo assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's profitability and consolidated financial position, or that reserves or insurance will mitigate such impact. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nPRODUCT WARRANTY AND RECALLS\nIf our products are alleged to fail to perform as expected or are defective, the Company may be exposed to various claims for damages and compensation. Such claims may result in costs and other losses to the Company even where the relevant product is eventually found to have functioned properly. If a product (actually or allegedly) fails to perform as expected or is defective, we may face warranty and recall claims. If such actual or alleged failure or defect results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage, we may also face product liability and other claims. The Company may experience material warranty, recall, product or other liability claims or losses in the future, and the Company may incur significant cost to defend against such claims. The Company may be required to participate in a recall involving its products. Each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers. Government safety regulators also have policies and practices with respect to recalls. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. In addition, with global platforms and procedures, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly evaluating our quality performance on a global basis. Any one or more quality, warranty or other recall issue(s), including the ones affecting few units and/or having a small financial impact, may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures which may have a severe impact on the Company's operations, such as a temporary or prolonged suspension of new orders or the Company's ability to bid for new business.\nIn addition, over time, there is a risk that the number of vehicles affected by a failure or defect will increase significantly (as would the Company's costs), since our products often use global designs and are increasingly based on or utilize the same or similar parts, components or solutions.\nAlthough quality has always been a central focus in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, our customers and regulators have become increasingly attentive to quality with even less tolerance for any deviations, which has resulted in an increase in the number of automotive recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. A warranty recall or a product liability claim brought against the Company in excess of the Company's insurance may have a material adverse effect on its business and/or financial results. Vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their external suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. A vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold the Company responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the product supplied did not perform as represented. Additionally, a customer may not allow us to bid for expiring or new business until certain remedial steps have been taken. Accordingly, the future costs of warranty claims by the Company's customers may be material.\nThe Company's warranty reserves are based upon management's best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims. Management regularly evaluates the appropriateness of these reserves and adjusts them when we believe it is appropriate to do so. However, the final amounts determined to be due could differ materially from the Company's recorded estimates. We believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements typically seen in our business.\nThe Company's strategy is to follow a stringent procedure when developing new products and technologies and to apply a proactive zero-defect\u201d quality policy (see section Quality Management). In addition, the Company carries insurance for potential recall and product liability claims at coverage levels that management believes are generally sufficient to cover the risks based on the Company's prior claims experience. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover every possible claim that can arise in the Company's businesses, now or in the future, or may not always will be available should the Company, now or in the future, wish to extend, renew, increase or otherwise adjust such insurance. Management's decision regarding what insurance to procure is also impacted by the cost for such insurance. As a result, the Company may face material losses in excess of the insurance coverage procured. A substantial recall or liability in excess of coverage levels could therefore have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nMost of the Company's manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of components. As a result, the environmental impact from the Company's plants is generally modest. While the Company's businesses from time to time are subject to environmental investigations, there are no material environmental-related cases pending against the Company. Therefore, Autoliv does not incur (or expect to incur) any material costs or capital expenditures associated with maintaining facilities compliant with U.S. or non-U.S. environmental requirements. To reduce environmental risk, the Company has implemented an environmental management system in all plants globally and has adopted an environmental policy (see corporate website www.autoliv.com).\nAutoliv is subject to a number of environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such requirements are complex and are generally becoming more stringent over time. There can be no assurance that these requirements will not change in the future, or that we will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements and regulations, despite our intention to be. The Company may also find itself subject, possibly due to changes in legislation or other regulation, to environmental liabilities based on the activities of its predecessor entities or of businesses acquired. Such liability could be based on activities which are not related to the Company's current activities.\nTRADE\nAutoliv is subject to various international trade regulations and regimes and changes in these regimes could lead to increased compliance costs and costs of raw materials and other components. In addition, political conditions leading to trade conflicts and the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers between countries in which we do business could increase our costs of doing business.\nStrategic Risks\nREGULATIONS\nIn addition to vehicle production, the Company's market is driven by the safety content per vehicle, which is affected by new regulations and new vehicle rating programs, in addition to consumer demand for new safety technologies.\nThe most important regulations are the seatbelt installation laws that exist in all vehicle-producing countries. Many countries also have strict enforcement laws on the wearing of seatbelts. Another significant vehicle safety regulation is the U.S. federal law that, since 1997, requires frontal airbags for both the driver and the front-seat passenger in all new vehicles sold in the U.S. In 2007, the U.S. adopted new regulations for side-impact protection which now have been fully phased-in. China introduced a vehicle rating program in 2006, and Latin America introduced a similar program in 2010 followed by ASEAN NCAP in Southeast Asia in 2011. The United States upgraded its vehicle rating program in 2010 and Europe upgraded the Euro NCAP rating system during 2018. Euro NCAP has initiated the next upgrade, which will be fully implemented by 2025. Japan and South Korea are continuously upgrading their respective vehicle rating programs, JNCAP and KNCAP respectively. India requires frontal airbags for the driver for all new passenger vehicles (M1) from July 2019. There are also other plans for improved automotive safety, both in these countries and other countries that could affect the Company's market.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that changes in regulations will not adversely affect the demand for the Company's products or, at least, result in a slower increase in the demand for them.\nDEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS\nIn 2019, the five largest vehicle manufacturers accounted for 51% of global LVP and the ten largest manufacturers for 74%.\nAs a result of this highly consolidated market, the Company is dependent on a relatively small number of customers with strong purchasing power.\nIn 2019, the Company's five largest customers accounted for 52% of revenues and the ten largest customers for 79% of revenues. For a list of the largest customers, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOur largest customer contract accounted for around 2% of sales in 2019. Although business with every major customer is split into at least several contracts (usually one contract per vehicle platform) and although the customer base has become more balanced and diversified as a result of Autoliv's significant expansion in China and other rapidly-growing markets, the loss of all business from a major customer (whether by a cancellation of existing contracts or not awarding Autoliv new business), the consolidation of one or more major customers or a bankruptcy of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, a quality issue, shortcomings in our service to a customer or uncompetitive prices or products could result in the customer not awarding us new business, which will gradually have a negative impact on our sales when current contracts start to expire.\nCUSTOMER PAYMENT RISK\nAnother risk related to our customers is the risk that one or more of our customers will be unable to pay their invoices that become due. We seek to limit this customer payment risk by invoicing our major customers through their local subsidiaries in each country, even for global contracts. By invoicing this way, we attempt to avoid having the receivables with a multinational customer group exposed to the risk that a bankruptcy or similar event in one country would put all receivables with such customer group at risk. In each country, we also monitor invoices becoming overdue.\nEven so, if a major customer is unable to fulfill its payment obligations, it is likely that we would be forced to record a substantial loss on such receivables.\nDEPENDENCE ON SUPPLIERS\nAutoliv relies on internal and/or external suppliers in order to meet its delivery commitments to the customers. In some cases, suppliers are dictated by the customers based on very specific qualification requirements. In other areas, Autoliv is dependent on a single supplier for a specific component. Autoliv supply chain organization is reviewing sourcing risks and actively working on mitigating related supply chain risks.\nAutoliv's ambition is to maintain an optimal number of suppliers in all significant component technologies.\nNEW COMPETITION\nIncreased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and delivery as well as engineering capabilities, technical expertise, product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. To maintain our competitiveness and position as a market leader, it is important to focus on all of these aspects of supplier evaluation and selection.\nAlthough the market for occupant restraint systems has undergone a significant consolidation during the past ten years, the passive safety market remains very competitive. It cannot be excluded that additional competitors, both global and local, will seek to enter the market or grow beyond their current Keiretsu group or traditional customer base. Particularly in China, South Korea and Japan there are numerous small domestic competitors often supplying just one OEM group.\nPATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY\nThe Company's strategy is to protect its innovations with patents, and to vigorously protect and defend its patents, trademarks and know-how against infringement and unauthorized use. At the end of 2019, the Company held more than 6,000 patents. These patents expire on various dates during the period from 2020 to 2039. The expiration of any single patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nAlthough the Company believes that its products and technology do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future. Also, there can be no assurance that any patent now owned by the Company will afford protection against competitors that develop similar technology. As the Company continues to expand its products and expand into new businesses, it will increase its exposure to intellectual property claims.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company is exposed to financial risks through its operations. To reduce the financial risks and to take advantage of economies of scale, the Company has a central treasury department supporting operations and management. The treasury department handles external financial transactions and functions as the Company's in-house bank for its subsidiaries.\nThe Board of Directors monitors compliance with the financial risk policy on an on-going basis. For information about specific financial risks, see", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImportant Trends\nThe discussions and analysis in this section are focused on our continuing operations. For more information on our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Discussions of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 that have been omitted under this item can be found in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019.\nAutoliv, Inc. (the Company\u201d) provides automotive safety systems to the automotive industry with a broad range of product offerings, primarily passive safety systems. In the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, a number of factors have influenced the Company's results of operations. The most notable factors have been:\n \u2022 Substantial decline in global light vehicle production \n \u2022 Growth of safety content per vehicle \n \u2022 High order intake share maintained \n \u2022 Operational initiatives \n \u2022 Continued focus on operational excellence and quality \n \u2022 Changes in competitive environment \n\n 1) Reported figures impacted by costs for capacity alignments, antitrust related matters and by separation costs. See section Items affecting comparability and Notes 3, 12 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. \n 2) Assuming dilution and net of treasury shares. \n 3) Including antitrust provision expense of $210 million in 2018. \n 4) Including Discontinued Operations in 2018. Including EC antitrust payment of $203 million in 2019. \n 5) The Company has decided not to recalculate prior periods since the distribution of Veoneer had a significant impact on capital employed making the comparison less meaningful. \nGROWTH IN LIGHT VEHICLE PRODUCTION AND SAFETY CONTENT PER VEHICLE\nThe most important driver for Autoliv's sales is the light vehicle production (LVP). During the past ten years LVP has shown year-over-year growth with the exception of 2019 and 2018. During 2019 we experienced deterioration of market conditions resulting in declines of LVP in all regions. The most significant decline in LVP, came in China due to lower consumer demand for vehicles and new emission regulations, and in Europe from uncertainty around drivetrain choices, public policy changes and declining consumer sentiments. As a result, full-year 2019 global LVP declined by 6%. This came after a 1% decline in 2018.\n\nChinese LVP, the world's largest automotive market, declined by 2.4 million units or by 9% from 2018 to 2019. In Europe, an important market for automotive safety systems, LVP decreased by 4% or by approximately 0.9 million light vehicles during the same period. In North America, LVP declined by 4% or 0.7 million light vehicles. Affected by political and macro-economic factors, LVP in India decreased by 12%, to 4.2 million light vehicles in 2019.\nEurope's and the Americas share of global LVP has remained unchanged at 24% and 21%, respectively, while China's share declined from 28% to 27%. Japan's share increased from 10% to 11% as LVP remained steady.\nDue to more stringent crash ratings, by institutes such as EuroNCAP; and increasing consumer demand for more safety in emerging markets, we see vehicle manufacturers installing more airbags and more advanced seatbelt systems in vehicles. This generally takes place when new models are introduced. The safety standards of vehicles are increasing in China, India and other growth markets such as Brazil, partially due to new regulations and crash test rating programs. For example, the Indian government has decided on a new traffic regulation that mandates more rigid crash test standards for light vehicles. This should eventually lead to a higher installation rate of airbags and more advanced seatbelts. In 2019, the decline in LVP was pronounced in markets with lower average safety content per vehicle (CPV) such as China, India and Other Asia, where the CPV is approximately $180, $80 and $160, respectively. These positive trends were in 2019 offset by negative currency translation effects. The average global safety CPV (airbags, seatbelts and steering wheels) was therefore unchanged at around $225. In addition, there is a negative effect from continued pricing pressure from vehicle manufacturers.\nThe more stringent crash ratings and consumer demand for more safety should enable the global automotive safety market to grow faster than the global LVP during the next three years.\nWELL BALANCED GLOBAL FOOTPRINT\nAutoliv's regional sales mix continues to be balanced with 29% of sales in Europe, 34% in the Americas and 37% in Asia in 2019, compared to 32%, 31% and 37%, respectively, in 2018. In Asia, our sales in the important Chinese market remained at 18% of total sales in 2019. Regardless of the weakness in the Chinese market, we remain well positioned in that market, which is the world's largest automotive producing market.\nThe balanced regional sales mix has been achieved through timely investments and strengthening of technical and support capabilities in growth markets and early introduction and execution of our restructuring and capacity alignment activities. To further improve our competitiveness, we have also made substantial investments to increase manufacturing capacity for vertical integration in China and Thailand.\nFor Asia as a whole, the effect of the higher sales in China, Other Asia and India was partly offset by declining sales in Japan.\nThe fastest growing customer from 2018 to 2019 was Honda. Its share of our sales has increased from 8% to 10%. The second largest customer based in Asia is Hyundai/Kia, accounting for 8% of Autoliv sales. The local Chinese OEMs as a group accounted for around 4% of our sales in 2019, with Great Wall representing 2%.\nOur sales to premium brand OEMs accounted for around 17% of total sales in 2019, while their share of global LVP is approximately 12%. Our strong position with premium OEMs reflects the higher safety content in their vehicles along with our position as a technology leader in the automotive safety market.\nThe U.S. based OEMs (including Tesla) account for 21% of our global sales, down from 29% in 2014. This is in part due to the sale of GM's European operations, Opel, to PSA. Tesla now accounts for more than 1% of our 2019 sales.\nCONTINUED STRONG ORDER INTAKE SHARE\nBuilding on a strong base, including supplying products to nearly 1,300 vehicle models and 100 car brands, Autoliv recorded its highest order intake share ever during the past five-year period, winning around 50% of available orders. Our share of order intake in prior years is significantly above our current sales market share of more than 41% in 2019. The order intake is broad based and we have improved our market position in three dimensions - regional, customer and product category. The lead time from order intake to start of production is typically 18-36 months. During this period the products are engineered into the vehicle to provide the expected protection for occupants in case of a crash and to meet legal and regulatory requirements, as well as other requirements from the vehicle manufacturer. This investment in new products is the main reason for the high level of RD&E expenses, net. Additionally, we have to build up production capacity, in the form of new lines, to meet future product launches.\nOur order intake share for 2019 continued on the same high level as in 2018, supporting our growth opportunities also beyond 2020. We estimate that we booked about 50% of available order value in 2019, making 2019 the fifth consecutive year of booking around or more than 50% of available order value. The estimated life-time sales for all orders booked in 2019 is $11.0 billion, compared to $15.1 billion in 2018. 2018 was an exceptional year with sourcing of several large vehicle platforms with a life-time longer than the typical 4 to 6 years. New order intake is defined as the sales value of awards for future business, received within that year. The life time value is calculated using detailed assumptions of price and volumes over the years of production and the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receiving the order.\nDue to the lead time from order to start of production, 2017 was the first year that the increased level of order intake began to impact our sales. Over the last two years, sales have substantially outperformed the change in global LVP. In 2019 and 2018 the outperformance was around 7 pp and 6 pp, respectively. During 2019, growth was positively affected through recent launches of several new models, including Honda CR-V, Tesla Model 3, Audi Q3, Ram Trucks and Volkswagen T-Cross.\nOPERATIONAL INITIATIVES\nAs market weakness has continued in 2019, we have stepped up the cost improvement actions, launching a Structural Efficiency Program, including targeting a reduction of our indirect workforce by approximately 800. The cost for the program is estimated to be approximately $52 million and it is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2020. Annualized savings is estimated to be around $60 million which is equal to about 5% of indirect labor costs.\nThe costs for restructuring activities in 2019 amounted to $54 million compared to $9 million in 2018.\nThe current restructuring activities are expected to have a payback period of around 1 year, after cash-out. The cash payments in 2019 were $30 million compared to $14 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we have $56 million reserved in our balance sheet related to restructuring (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).\nWe continue to actively manage the business cycle downturn as we reduced the total direct workforce by 1,500 in 2019, despite growing our sales organically (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) by 1.2% compared to 2018.\nWith more than 100 improvement projects being evaluated, we have set a high pace in the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives and structural improvements. These initiatives are key drivers to our medium-term target and building the foundation to continue to create shareholder value.\nIMPROVED EFFICIENCIES THROUGH OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nPricing pressure is an inherent part of the automotive supplier business. Price reductions are generally higher on newer products with strong volume growth compared to older products, where both the possibilities to re-design the product to reduce costs and market growth are less. Price reductions can also depend on the business cycle. For the period 2018-2019, we estimate the average reduction of our market prices to have been in the range of 2-4% annually. As described below, to meet these price reductions, we have implemented several programs and taken actions to address our cost structure. Additionally, during the period 2018-2019, we have experienced accumulated raw material commodity costs increase of more than $80 million.\nOur productivity improvement target is to achieve at least 5% savings per year. To meet this target, Autoliv has developed a set of strategies to reduce costs in manufacturing:\n \u2022 Autoliv production system (APS) is based on lean manufacturing methodology which aims to continuously increase output with less resources. APS provides the target conditions and tools to achieve the delivery of goods and services at the right time, in the right amount, at the required quality and at the lowest cost possible to all our customers. \n \u2022 Our One Product One Process (1P1P) strategy focuses on product and process standardization and reducing cost and complexity. The 1P1P strategy, combined with initiatives to reduce costs for components from external suppliers, ensures that we continuously optimize our supply base footprint, consolidate purchase volumes to fewer suppliers, improve productivity in our supply chain, standardize components and redesign our products. \n \u2022 Strategic Initiatives including Automation, Digitalization, Supply Chain Management Effectiveness and RD&E Effectiveness. \nOur Continuous improvement strategies have enabled productivity improvement above our target of 5% over the last years, except 2018 due to a sharp increase in launch activities. Excluding impact from Force Majeure situation in our plant in Mexico, we have come back to around historical performance during 2019. This is achieved despite the increased launch activities also impacted us during 2019.\nReducing labor costs to offset the price erosion on our products is achieved through continuously implementing productivity improvement programs, expanding production in Best Cost Countries (BCCs) and instituting restructuring and capacity alignment activities. The number of employees in the BCCs in relation to total number of associates remains over 80% in 2019.\nThese initiatives, in combination with our restructuring activities, investment in vertical integration and several other actions, are in place to offset the market price erosion.\nWe foresee opportunities for further productivity on gains from increasing use of automation in our assembly for lean manufacturing processes. Additionally, automated cells typically perform the manufacturing process with reduced variability. This results in greater control and consistency of product quality.\nFOCUS ON QUALITY\nThe number of vehicle recalls in the automotive industry has risen sharply in recent years. From 2015 to 2019, Takata's airbag inflators recall generated a record number of recalls in the automotive industry. We expect overall recall numbers to remain high for years to come and, although we strive for the highest quality in our processes, it cannot be ruled out that we may also be adversely impacted by a future recall.\nQuality has been and always will be our number one priority, and we continue to sharpen our focus in this area. We now hold a market share of more than 41% in passive safety while we have been involved in less than 2% of passive safety recalls in the industry in the past ten years; an important indicator that we are delivering on our quality strategy. For more information see product warranty and recalls in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCHANGES IN COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\nDuring the past five years, we experienced significant changes in our competitive landscape. In 2015, TRW, a key competitor in passive safety, was acquired by German group ZF Friedrichshafen. Combined, the new company is the third-largest passive safety supplier globally. In 2016, Key Safety Systems ( KSS\u201d) was acquired by Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. Beginning in 2014, Takata, our largest competitor at the time, experienced severe issues and recalls related to malfunctioning airbag inflators, leading the company to file for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan. In 2018, Joyson substantially acquired all of Takata's global assets and operations and combined it with KSS, forming the new company JSS.\nEuropean Commission AntitruSt Investigation\nSince 2011, Autoliv was subject to an investigation of anti-competitive behavior among suppliers of occupant safety systems by the European Commission (EC). On March 5, 2019, the EC completed the remaining portion of the investigation and imposed a fine on the Company of \u20ac179 million (approximately $203 million). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company had previously accrued \u20ac184 million (approximately $210 million) with respect to the remaining portion of the investigation. The difference between the actual fine and the accrual is reported in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated statements of net income. The final payment of the actual fine was made in June 2019.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe Company's net debt stood at $1,650 million on December 31, 2019. This was an increase of $31 million compared to December 31, 2018. Total interest bearing debt at December 31, 2019 amounted to $2,094 million, a decrease of $136 million compared to December 31, 2018.\nCash flow from operations was $641 million in 2019 and $591 million in 2018, including discontinued operations. Capital expenditures, net amounted to $476 million in 2019 and $555 million in 2018. During the two-year period 2018-2019, the Company paid dividends of $431 million. After the latest declared dividend of 62 cents per share, the annualized run rate is $216 million, based on the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain a financial leverage commensurate with a strong investment grade credit rating\u201d. The long-term target is to have a leverage ratio (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) of around 1.0 and to be within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. At December 31, 2019, the current leverage ratio is 1.7. The Company monitors its capital structure and the financial markets closely and intends to maintain a high level of financial flexibility while being shareholder friendly.\nAs part of the adjustment of the capital structure, the Company historically has repurchased shares of its common stock. During 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares. At December 31, 2019, the remaining number of shares authorized by the board of directors for repurchase is approximately 3.0 million shares.\nCURRENCY IMPACTS\nThe Company is exposed to around 50 currency pairs, with exposures in excess of $1 million each. We are monitoring our currency exposure but do not hedge currency flows. Rather we strive to have sales and costs in the same currency to reduce the transaction exposure risk. The total net transaction exposure in 2019 was approximately $2.1 billion or 25% of sales. Approximately three quarters of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which is leading to currency translation effects.\nOutlook for 2020\nOur organic sales growth and adjusted operating margin outlook indications for 2020 reflect the continuing high level of uncertainty in the automotive markets and assume that global light vehicle production declines by 2-3% in full year 2020 compared to full year 2019.\n\n 1) Excluding costs for capacity alignments and anti-trust related matters. \n 2) Excluding unusual items. \nThe forward-looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis. Autoliv has not provided a U.S. GAAP reconciliation of these measures because items that impact these measures, such as costs related to capacity alignments and antitrust matters cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and Autoliv is unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nSignificant Legal Matters\nSee Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 18 Contingent Liabilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Versus 2018\nSales by Product\n\n 1) Effects from currency translations. \n 2) Including Corporate and Other sales. \nConsolidated net sales decreased by 1.5% compared to full year 2018. Excluding negative currency translation effects of 2.7% the organic growth (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) was 1.2%.\nAirbag sales grew organically (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) by 2.0%, mainly driven by strong performance for steering wheels, particularly in Americas, with slight net growth contribution coming from airbags, as a result of growth in Americas and China and a decline in Europe. Inflator sales declined in North America, Japan and China.\nSeatbelt sales declined organically (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) by 0.2%, with main growth contributors being China and to a lesser degree Americas, offset by a decline in Europe. The trend of higher sales of more advanced and higher value-added seatbelt systems continued.\nSales by Region\n\n 1) Effects from currency translations. \nFor the full year 2019, Autoliv's sales grew organically (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) by 1.2% compared to full year 2018, more than 7pp higher than LVP growth according to IHS. The largest contributor to overall growth was North America, followed by China and South America. The largest organic sales decline was in Europe followed by Japan.\nOur organic sales growth outperformed LVP by more than 13pp in China and by around 10pp in North America, while we grew organically slower than LVP by around 3pp in Japan and by 0.7pp in Europe. In South America, we grew organically around 30pp more than LVP, while we outgrew LVP organically by around 8pp in Rest of Asia.\n\n\n 1) Assuming dilution and net of treasury shares. \n 2) Participating share awards with right to receive dividend equivalents are (under the two-class method) excluded from the EPS calculation. \nGROSS PROFIT\nThe gross profit for the full year 2019 declined by $127 million and the gross margin declined by 1.2pp compared to 2018. The gross margin was adversely impacted by the decline in global light vehicle production, resulting in a lower utilization of our production assets, raw material headwinds and the social unrest in Matamoros, Mexico. This was offset to some degree by organic growth (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) from launches of new products, which have a lower contribution margin in the early phase of the ramp-up.\nOPERATING INCOME\nOperating income increased by around $40 million to $726 million. The reported operating margin was 8.5% of sales, compared to 7.9% of sales in the prior year. The increase of 0.6pp of sales was mainly due to lower costs for antitrust related matters, reported as Other income (expense), net, partly offset by the lower gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A) expenses increased by $9 million or 0.2pp of sales driven mainly by investments in digitalization and slightly higher legal fees, partly offset by slightly lower personnel costs. Research, Development & Engineering (R,D&E) expenses, net declined by $7 million, mainly due to higher engineering income. In relation to sales, it improved to 4.7% in 2019 from 4.8% in 2018.\nFINANCIAL AND NON-OPERTING ITEMS, NET\nFinancial and non-operating items, net in full year 2019 was $77 million. The increase of $3 million compared to $74 million in full year 2018 was mainly due to higher net interest costs due to higher average net interest bearing debt in 2019.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate of 28.6% was 9.8pp lower than last year primarily due to the 2018 unfavorable tax impact from the antitrust accrual in 2018.\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income attributable to controlling interest from Continuing Operations increased by $85 million compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower cost for antitrust accrual as noted above.\nEarnings per share (EPS), diluted increased by 98 cents where the main drivers were 209 cents from lower costs for capacity alignment, the separation of our business segments and antitrust matters, 108 cents from lower tax partially offset by 213 cents from lower adjusted operating income (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures).\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution in 2019 was 87.4 million compared to 87.3 million in 2018.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures\nIn this annual report we sometimes refer to non-U.S. GAAP measures that we and securities analysts use in measuring Autoliv's performance.\nWe believe that these measures assist investors and management in analyzing trends in the Company's business for the reasons given below. Investors should not consider these non-U.S. GAAP measures as substitutes for, but rather as additions to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-U.S. GAAP measures have been identified, as applicable, in each section of this annual report with tabular presentations provided below, reconciling them to U.S. GAAP.\nIt should be noted that these measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nORGANIC SALES\nWe analyze the Company's sales trends and performance as changes in organic sales growth\u201d, because the Company currently generates approximately three quarters of net sales in currencies other than the reporting currency (i.e. U.S. dollars) and currency rates have proven to be rather volatile. We also use organic sales to reflect the fact that the Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures.\nOrganic sales present the increase or decrease in the overall U.S. dollar net sales on a comparable basis, allowing separate discussions of the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and exchange rates.\nThe following tabular reconciliation presents changes in organic sales growth\u201d as reconciled to the change in total U.S. GAAP net sales.\nCOMPONENTS IN SALES INCREASE/DECREASE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\n 1) Rest of Asia. \n 2) Effects from currency translations. \nRECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP MEASURE TO OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL\u201d (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nRECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP MEASURE TO NET DEBT\u201d (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nOPERATING WORKING CAPITAL\nDue to the need to optimize cash generation to create value for our shareholders, management focuses on operationally derived working capital as defined in the table above.\nThe reconciling items used to derive this measure are, by contrast, managed as part of our overall management of cash and debt, but they are not part of the responsibilities of day-to-day operations management.\nNET DEBT\nAs part of efficiently managing the Company's overall cost of funds, we routinely enter into debt-related derivatives\u201d (DRD) as part of our debt management.\nCreditors and credit rating agencies use net debt adjusted for DRD in their analyses of the Company's debt and therefore we provide this non-U.S. GAAP measure. DRD are fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt. Also included in the DRD is the unamortized fair value adjustment related to discontinued fair value hedges, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt. By adjusting for DRD, the total financial liability of net debt is disclosed without grossing debt up with currency or interest fair values.\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN AND ADJUSTED EPS\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures our management uses to evaluate our business, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature (such as costs related to capacity alignments, costs related to antitrust matters, separation costs, impairment charges and for EPS unusual tax items) and that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and underlying business trends. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including operating margin and EPS.\n\n 1) Adjustments for capacity alignments, antitrust matters and separation of our business segments. See table below for a disaggregation of these costs. \n 2) Operating income and income from equity method investments Continuing Operations, relative to average capital employed. \n 3) Income from Continuing Operations relative to average total equity. \n 4) Assuming dilution and net of treasury shares. \n 5) Participating share awards with right to receive dividend equivalents are (under the two-class method) excluded from the EPS calculation. \n\n 1) The tax is calculated based on the tax laws in the respective jurisdiction(s) of the adjustment(s). \n 2) After adjustment for annualized non-U.S. GAAP EBIT adjustment. \n 3) Operating income and income from equity method investments Continuing Operations, relative to average capital employed. \n 4) Income from Continuing Operations relative to average total equity. \n 5) After adjustment for annualized non-U.S. GAAP Net income adjustment. \nQUARTERLY 2019 RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN\u201d AND ADJUSTED EPS\u201d\n\n 1) Adjustments for capacity alignments, antitrust matters and separation of our business segments. \n 2) Assuming dilution and net of treasury shares. \n 3) Participating share awards with right to receive dividend equivalents are (under the two-class method) excluded from the EPS calculation. \nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\n\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash flow from operations, together with available financial resources and credit facilities, are expected to be sufficient to fund Autoliv's anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures and future dividend payments. Cash flow items are presented on a consolidated basis, for 2018 including both Continuing and Discontinued Operations.\nCash provided by operating activities was $641 million in 2019 compared to $591 million in 2018. The net increase compared to previous year was primarily due to higher contribution from changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by the $203 million EU antitrust payment in 2019.\nWhile management of cash and debt is important to the overall business, it is not part of the operational management's day-to-day responsibilities. We therefore focus on operationally derived working capital (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) and have set a policy that the operating working capital should not exceed 10% of the last 12-month net sales.\nAt December 31, 2019, operating working capital for Continuing Operations (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) amounted to $565 million corresponding to 6.6% of net sales compared to $478 million and 5.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Operating working capital excluding the EC antitrust provision, at December 31, 2018, amounted to $688 million, corresponding to 7.9% of net sales.\nDays receivables outstanding (see Glossary and Definitions for definition) were 70 at December 31, 2019, compared to 71 in 2018. Factoring agreements did not have any material effect on days receivables outstanding for 2019 or 2018.\nDays inventory outstanding (see Glossary and Definitions for definition) were 35 at December 31, 2019, compared to 35 in 2018.\nNET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nIn 2019 and 2018 cash used in investing activities amounted to $476 million and $628 million, respectively. In 2019 all cash used for investing activities was attributable to Continuing Operations compared to $486 million of the $628 million in 2018. Our investing activities primarily consists of investments in property, plant and equipment and acquisition of businesses, net of cash. For further information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCash generated by operating activities continued to sufficiently cover capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCapital expenditures, net for Continuing Operations was $476 million in 2019 and $486 million in 2018, corresponding to 5.6% of net sales for both years.\nDepreciation and amortization in Continuing Operations totaled $351 million in 2019 compared to $342 million in 2018.\nDuring the years 2018 and 2019, a majority of our investments were for production capacity to support the high level of new product launches. Major investments were mainly made in Europe, North America, China and Japan.\nIn 2019, expansion of facilities in Europe was commenced for manufacturing of seatbelts and airbags to meet increased demand. In North America, the higher investments were mainly related to production equipment to increase capacity for new program launches and a new technical center. In addition, Asia made large investments to increase manufacturing capacity to support new product launches.\nNET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCash used in financing activities amounted to $338 million and $245 million for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, the net issuance of debt amounted to $31 million; whereas, in 2018 the net issuance of debt amounted to $938 million. In 2019, the Company paid dividends of $217 million, compared to dividends paid of $214 million in 2018. In 2019, the Company made a $203 million payment relating to the EC antitrust investigation. In 2018, the Company capitalized Veoneer with $972 million prior to the spin-off.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of tax audits. At any given time, the Company is undergoing tax audits covering multiple years in several tax jurisdictions. Ultimate outcomes are uncertain but could, in future periods, have a significant impact on the Company's cash flows. See discussions of income taxes under Significant Accounting Policies in this section, Note 2 and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nPENSION ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering nearly half of the U.S. employees. In a prior year, the Company froze participation in the U.S. plans to exclude employees hired after December 31, 2003. Many of the Company's non-U.S. employees are also covered by pension arrangements.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's pension liability (i.e. the actual funded status) for its U.S. and non-U.S. plans was $240 million compared to $198 million one year earlier. The plans had a net unamortized actuarial loss of $115 million recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the Consolidated Statement of Equity at December 31, 2019, compared to $82 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in the actuarial loss was mainly due to a decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The amortization of this loss is expected to be $5 million in 2020.\nThe liability increase in 2019 of $42 million was mainly due to the decrease in discount rates. The liability decrease in 2018 of $9 million was mainly due to the increase in discount rates, partly offset by lower than expected plan assets return.\nPension expense associated with the defined benefit plans was $27 million in 2019, $20 million in 2018 and $29 million in 2017 and is expected to be $27 million in 2020. The increase in pension expense in 2019 of $7 million was mainly due to a prior year decrease in discount rates. The decrease in pension expense in 2018 of $9 million was mainly due to lower amortization of the unrecognized losses resulting from the amendment of the U.S. defined benefit plan.\nThe Company contributed $17 million to its defined benefit plans in 2019, $16 million in 2018 and $13 million in 2017. The Company expects to contribute $19 million to these plans in 2020 and is currently projecting a yearly funding at approximately the same level in the subsequent years.\nFor further information about retirement plans see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nSHAREHOLDER RETURNS\nTotal cash dividends paid were $217 million in 2019 and $214 million in 2018. The Company has raised the dividend from 60 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018 to 62 cents per share in 2019 (see following table). The Board of Directors has declared a dividend of 62 cents per share for both the first and second quarter of 2020. The annualized dividend amount of $217 million, is based on 62 cents per share and the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during 2019 and 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares for cash of $157 million, including commissions. In total, Autoliv has repurchased 44.5 million shares between May 2000 and December 2019 for cash of $2,498 million, including commissions. The maximum number of shares that are available to be purchased under the stock repurchase program at December 31, 2019 is 3.0 million. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase authorization in order to provide management flexibility in the Company's share repurchases. For further information see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\n\n 1) Declared. \nEQUITY\nDuring 2019, total equity increased by 11.9% or $226 million to $2,122 million. This was mainly due to a net income of $463 million, partly offset by $217 million for dividends to shareholders.\nDuring 2018, total equity decreased by 54.5% or $2,273 million to $1,897 million. This was mainly due to $2,123 million related to the spin-off of Veoneer, $214 million in dividends to shareholders and $150 million currency translation effects. The decrease was partly offset by $184 million from net income.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND RAW MATERIAL PRICES\nInflation has generally not had a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In many growth markets, inflation is relatively high, especially labor inflation. We have managed to offset this negative effect mainly by labor productivity improvements. However, no assurance can be given that this will continue to be possible going forward.\nThe Company has experienced headwind from raw material prices in both 2018 and 2019. During 2018, the headwinds were mainly form high cost for steel. The headwinds in 2019 were mainly coming from higher cost for steel and Nylon 66, used in airbag cushions.\nPERSONNEL\nDuring the past two years, total headcount (permanent employees and temporary personnel) has risen by 1.0% from the beginning of 2018 to 65,200 at the end of 2019. This reflects the strong order intake we have recognized in past quarters, which drive the need for additional manufacturing and R,D&E personnel.\nDuring 2019, headcount decreased by 1,500 people, compared to the 2,200 people increase during 2018.\nAt the end of 2019, 81% of total headcount was in BCC compared to 80% at the beginning of 2018. Furthermore, 71% of total headcount at December 31, 2019 was direct workers in manufacturing compared to 71% at the beginning of 2018, while 10% of total headcount at December 31, 2019 were temporary employees, compared to 12% at the beginning of 2018.\nCompensation to directors and executive officers is reported, as is customary for U.S. public companies, in Autoliv's proxy statement, which will be available to shareholders in March 2020.\nTreasury Activities\nCREDIT ARRANGEMENTS\nIn June 2019, the Company issued and sold \u20ac100 million of 18-month floating rate notes under its EMTN program. The floating rate notes carry a coupon of 3M Euribor +0.50%.\nIn June 2019, the Company also utilized a 3-year loan facility of SEK 1,200 million with a floating interest rate of 3M STIBOR +0.54%.\nIn June 2018, the Company priced and issued 5-year notes for a total of \u20ac500 million in the Eurobond market. The notes carry a coupon of 0.75%.\nIn July 2016, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit facility (RCF) of $1,100 million. The facility, syndicated among 14 banks, originally maturing in July 2021 with two extension options, each for an additional year. The extension options have been used by the Company and the maturity date for the facility has been extended to July 2023. The Company pays a commitment fee on the undrawn amount of 0.1%, representing 35% of the applicable margin, which is 0.275% (given the Company's rating of BBB+\u201d from S&P Global Ratings at December 31, 2018). Borrowings under the facility are unsecured and bear interest based on the relevant LIBOR or IBOR rate.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's unutilized long-term credit facilities were $1.1 billion, represented by the RCF. This facility is not subject to any financial covenants nor is any other substantial financing of Autoliv. The Company had a net debt position (see section Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures) at year end 2019 and 2018 of $1,650 million and $1,619 million, respectively.\nIn 2014, the Company issued and sold long-term debt securities in a U.S. Private Placement pursuant to a Note Purchase and Guaranty Agreement dated April 23, 2014, by and among Autoliv ASP Inc., the Company and the purchasers listed therein. As of December 31, 2019, $1,042 million remains outstanding from the 2014 issuance. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, the Company sold receivables and discounted notes related to selected customers. These factoring arrangements increase cash while reducing accounts receivable and customer risks. At December 31, 2019, the Company had received $163 million for sold receivables without recourse and discounted notes with a discount cost of $3 million during the year, compared to $193 million at year-end 2018 with a discount cost of $6 million recorded in Other non-operating items, net.\nIn September 2019, Autoliv's long-term credit rating was downgraded from A- to BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings while maintaining negative outlook on the rating. The company aims to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.\nNUMBER OF SHARES\nAt December 31, 2019, 87.2 million shares were outstanding (net of 15.6 million treasury shares), a 0.12% increase from 87.1 million one year earlier.\nThe number of shares outstanding is expected to increase by 0.4 million when all Restricted Stock Units (RSU) and Performance Shares (PSs) vest and if all stock options (SOs) to key employees are exercised, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nIn total, Autoliv has repurchased 44.5 million shares under its stock repurchase program between May 2000 and December 2019 for cash of $2,498 million, including commissions. The average cost per share for all repurchased shares to date is $56.13. Purchases can be made from time to time as market and business conditions warrant in open market, negotiated or block transactions. There is no expiration date for the repurchase program in order to provide management flexibility in the Company's share repurchases. No stock repurchases were made in 2019.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\n 1) Excludes contingent liabilities arising from litigation, arbitration, regulatory actions or income taxes. \n 2) Expected contributions for funded and unfunded defined benefit plans exclude payments beyond 2019. \nContractual obligations include debt, lease and purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Non-controlling interest and restructuring obligations are not included in this table. The major employee obligations as a result of restructuring are disclosed in Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nDebt obligations: For material contractual provisions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nFixed-interest obligations: These obligations include interest on debt and credit agreements relating to periods after December 31, 2019, excluding fees on the revolving credit facility and interest on debts with no defined amortization plan.\nOperating lease obligations: These obligations represent the payment obligations (undiscounted cash flows) under leases classified as operating leases. The Company leases certain offices, manufacturing and research buildings, machinery, automobiles, data processing and other equipment. Such operating leases, some of which are non-cancelable and include renewals, expire on various dates. Capital lease obligations are not material. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nUnconditional purchase obligations: There are no unconditional purchase obligations other than short-term obligations related to inventory, services, tooling, and property, plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business.\nPurchase agreements with suppliers entered into in the ordinary course of business do not generally include fixed quantities. Quantities and delivery dates are established in call off plans\u201d accessible electronically for all customers and suppliers involved. Communicated call off plans\u201d for production material from suppliers are normally reflected in equivalent commitments from Autoliv customers.\nPension contribution requirements: The Company sponsors defined benefit plans that cover a significant portion of our U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The pension plans in the U.S. are funded in conformity with the minimum funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Funding for our pension plans in other countries is based upon plan provisions, actuarial recommendations and/or statutory requirements.\nIn 2020, the expected contribution to all plans, including direct payments to retirees, is $19 million, of which the major contribution is $13 million for our U.S. pension plans. Due to volatility associated with future changes in interest rates and plan asset returns, the Company cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing and amounts of future funding requirements, and therefore the above excludes payments beyond 2020. We may elect to make contributions in excess of the minimum funding requirements for the U.S. plans in response to investment performance and changes in interest rates, or when we believe that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on other capital requirements. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOther non-current liabilities reflected on the balance sheet: These consist mainly of local governmental liabilities.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks and Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to several categories of risks. They can broadly be categorized as operational risks, strategic risks and financial risks. Some of the major risks in each category are described below. There are also other risks that could have a material effect on the Company's results and financial position, and the description below is not complete but should be read in conjunction with the discussion of risks described in Item 1A above, which contains a description of our material risks.\nAs described below, the Company has taken several mitigating actions, applied numerous strategies, adopted policies, and introduced control and reporting systems to reduce and mitigate these risks. In addition, the Company from time to time identifies and evaluates emerging or changing risks to the Company in order to ensure that identified risks and related risk management are updated in this fast-moving environment.\nOperational Risks\nLIGHT VEHICLE PRODUCTION\nAround 30% of Autoliv's costs are fixed; therefore, short-term earnings are dependent on sales volumes and highly dependent on capacity utilization in the Company's plants.\nGlobal LVP is an indicator of the Company's sales development. Ultimately, however, sales are determined by the production levels for the individual vehicle models for which Autoliv is a supplier (see Dependence on Customers). The Company's sales are split over several hundred contracts covering almost 1,300 vehicle models. This moderates the effect of changes in vehicle demand of individual countries and regions as well as production issues. The risk of fluctuating sales has also been mitigated by Autoliv's rapid expansion in Asia and other growth markets, which has reduced the Company's former high dependence on sales in Europe to a diversified mix with Europe, the Americas and Asia each accounting for roughly 30% to 40% of our 2019 total sales.\nIt is the Company's strategy to reduce the risk of fluctuating LVP by using a high number of temporary employees instead of permanent employees in direct production. During 2019 and 2018, the level of temporary employees in relation to total headcount in direct production was 11% and 17%, respectively. To reduce the potential impact of unusual fluctuations in the production of vehicle models supplied by the Company - such as during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 - it is also necessary for the Company to be prepared to quickly adapt the level of permanent employees as well as fixed cost production capacity.\nPRICING PRESSURE\nPricing pressure from customers is an inherent part of the automotive components business. The extent of price reductions varies from year to year and takes the form of one time give backs, reductions in direct sales prices or discounted reimbursements for engineering work.\nIn response, Autoliv is continuously engaged in efforts to reduce costs and to provide customers added value by developing new products. Generally, the speed by which these cost-reduction programs generate results will, to a large extent, determine the future profitability of the Company. The various cost-reduction programs are, to a considerable extent, interrelated. This interrelationship makes it difficult to isolate the impact of costs on any single program, therefore, we monitor key measures such as costs in relation to sales and productivity.\nCOMPONENT COSTS\nThe cost of direct materials was approximately 50% of sales in 2019.\nThe main raw materials being used as input material for Autoliv operations are textiles, plastic, steel and non-ferrous metals. Increased headwinds on raw materials in 2019 were primarily caused by a global shortage of Nylon 66 and the effects coming from the import tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum products, impacting the raw material market and creating uncertainty.\nWe take several actions to mitigate raw material price increases, such as competitive sourcing and exploring alternative materials.\nLEGAL\nThe Company is involved from time to time in regulatory, commercial and contractual legal proceedings that may be significant, and the Company's business may suffer as a result of adverse outcomes of current or future legal proceedings. These claims may include, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with the Company's suppliers and customers, intellectual property matters, alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations, governmental investigations, personal injury claims, product liability claims, environmental issues, tax and customs matters, and employment matters.\nA substantial legal liability or adverse regulatory outcome and the substantial cost to defend the litigation or regulatory proceedings may have an adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nNo assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's profitability and consolidated financial position, or that reserves or insurance will mitigate such impact. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nPRODUCT WARRANTY AND RECALLS\nIf our products are alleged to fail to perform as expected or are defective, the Company may be exposed to various claims for damages and compensation. Such claims may result in costs and other losses to the Company even where the relevant product is eventually found to have functioned properly. If a product (actually or allegedly) fails to perform as expected or is defective, we may face warranty and recall claims. If such actual or alleged failure or defect results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage, we may also face product liability and other claims. The Company may experience material warranty, recall, product or other liability claims or losses in the future, and the Company may incur significant cost to defend against such claims. The Company may be required to participate in a recall involving its products. Each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers. Government safety regulators also have policies and practices with respect to recalls. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. In addition, with global platforms and procedures, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly evaluating our quality performance on a global basis. Any one or more quality, warranty or other recall issue(s), including the ones affecting few units and/or having a small financial impact, may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures which may have a severe impact on the Company's operations, such as a temporary or prolonged suspension of new orders or the Company's ability to bid for new business.\nIn addition, over time, there is a risk that the number of vehicles affected by a failure or defect will increase significantly (as would the Company's costs), since our products often use global designs and are increasingly based on or utilize the same or similar parts, components or solutions.\nAlthough quality has always been a central focus in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, our customers and regulators have become increasingly attentive to quality with even less tolerance for any deviations, which has resulted in an increase in the number of automotive recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. A warranty recall or a product liability claim brought against the Company in excess of the Company's insurance may have a material adverse effect on its business and/or financial results. Vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their external suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. A vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold the Company responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the product supplied did not perform as represented. Additionally, a customer may not allow us to bid for expiring or new business until certain remedial steps have been taken. Accordingly, the future costs of warranty claims by the Company's customers may be material.\nThe Company's warranty reserves are based upon management's best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims. Management regularly evaluates the appropriateness of these reserves and adjusts them when we believe it is appropriate to do so. However, the final amounts determined to be due could differ materially from the Company's recorded estimates. We believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements typically seen in our business.\nThe Company's strategy is to follow a stringent procedure when developing new products and technologies and to apply a proactive zero-defect\u201d quality policy (see section Quality Management). In addition, the Company carries insurance for potential recall and product liability claims at coverage levels that management believes are generally sufficient to cover the risks based on the Company's prior claims experience. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover every possible claim that can arise in the Company's businesses, now or in the future, or may not always will be available should the Company, now or in the future, wish to extend, renew, increase or otherwise adjust such insurance. Management's decision regarding what insurance to procure is also impacted by the cost for such insurance. As a result, the Company may face material losses in excess of the insurance coverage procured. A substantial recall or liability in excess of coverage levels could therefore have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nMost of the Company's manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of components. As a result, the environmental impact from the Company's plants is generally modest. While the Company's businesses from time to time are subject to environmental investigations, there are no material environmental-related cases pending against the Company. Therefore, Autoliv does not incur (or expect to incur) any material costs or capital expenditures associated with maintaining facilities compliant with U.S. or non-U.S. environmental requirements. To reduce environmental risk, the Company has implemented an environmental management system in all plants globally and has adopted an environmental policy (see corporate website www.autoliv.com).\nAutoliv is subject to a number of environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such requirements are complex and are generally becoming more stringent over time. There can be no assurance that these requirements will not change in the future, or that we will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements and regulations, despite our intention to be. The Company may also find itself subject, possibly due to changes in legislation or other regulation, to environmental liabilities based on the activities of its predecessor entities or of businesses acquired. Such liability could be based on activities which are not related to the Company's current activities.\nTRADE\nAutoliv is subject to various international trade regulations and regimes and changes in these regimes could lead to increased compliance costs and costs of raw materials and other components. In addition, political conditions leading to trade conflicts and the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers between countries in which we do business could increase our costs of doing business.\nStrategic Risks\nREGULATIONS\nIn addition to vehicle production, the Company's market is driven by the safety content per vehicle, which is affected by new regulations and new vehicle rating programs, in addition to consumer demand for new safety technologies.\nThe most important regulations are the seatbelt installation laws that exist in all vehicle-producing countries. Many countries also have strict enforcement laws on the wearing of seatbelts. Another significant vehicle safety regulation is the U.S. federal law that, since 1997, requires frontal airbags for both the driver and the front-seat passenger in all new vehicles sold in the U.S. In 2007, the U.S. adopted new regulations for side-impact protection which now have been fully phased-in. China introduced a vehicle rating program in 2006, and Latin America introduced a similar program in 2010 followed by ASEAN NCAP in Southeast Asia in 2011. The United States upgraded its vehicle rating program in 2010 and Europe upgraded the Euro NCAP rating system during 2018. Euro NCAP has initiated the next upgrade, which will be fully implemented by 2025. Japan and South Korea are continuously upgrading their respective vehicle rating programs, JNCAP and KNCAP respectively. India requires frontal airbags for the driver for all new passenger vehicles (M1) from July 2019. There are also other plans for improved automotive safety, both in these countries and other countries that could affect the Company's market.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that changes in regulations will not adversely affect the demand for the Company's products or, at least, result in a slower increase in the demand for them.\nDEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS\nIn 2019, the five largest vehicle manufacturers accounted for 51% of global LVP and the ten largest manufacturers for 74%.\nAs a result of this highly consolidated market, the Company is dependent on a relatively small number of customers with strong purchasing power.\nIn 2019, the Company's five largest customers accounted for 52% of revenues and the ten largest customers for 79% of revenues. For a list of the largest customers, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOur largest customer contract accounted for around 2% of sales in 2019. Although business with every major customer is split into at least several contracts (usually one contract per vehicle platform) and although the customer base has become more balanced and diversified as a result of Autoliv's significant expansion in China and other rapidly-growing markets, the loss of all business from a major customer (whether by a cancellation of existing contracts or not awarding Autoliv new business), the consolidation of one or more major customers or a bankruptcy of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, a quality issue, shortcomings in our service to a customer or uncompetitive prices or products could result in the customer not awarding us new business, which will gradually have a negative impact on our sales when current contracts start to expire.\nCUSTOMER PAYMENT RISK\nAnother risk related to our customers is the risk that one or more of our customers will be unable to pay their invoices that become due. We seek to limit this customer payment risk by invoicing our major customers through their local subsidiaries in each country, even for global contracts. By invoicing this way, we attempt to avoid having the receivables with a multinational customer group exposed to the risk that a bankruptcy or similar event in one country would put all receivables with such customer group at risk. In each country, we also monitor invoices becoming overdue.\nEven so, if a major customer is unable to fulfill its payment obligations, it is likely that we would be forced to record a substantial loss on such receivables.\nDEPENDENCE ON SUPPLIERS\nAutoliv relies on internal and/or external suppliers in order to meet its delivery commitments to the customers. In some cases, suppliers are dictated by the customers based on very specific qualification requirements. In other areas, Autoliv is dependent on a single supplier for a specific component. Autoliv supply chain organization is reviewing sourcing risks and actively working on mitigating related supply chain risks.\nAutoliv's ambition is to maintain an optimal number of suppliers in all significant component technologies.\nNEW COMPETITION\nIncreased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and delivery as well as engineering capabilities, technical expertise, product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. To maintain our competitiveness and position as a market leader, it is important to focus on all of these aspects of supplier evaluation and selection.\nAlthough the market for occupant restraint systems has undergone a significant consolidation during the past ten years, the passive safety market remains very competitive. It cannot be excluded that additional competitors, both global and local, will seek to enter the market or grow beyond their current Keiretsu group or traditional customer base. Particularly in China, South Korea and Japan there are numerous small domestic competitors often supplying just one OEM group.\nPATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY\nThe Company's strategy is to protect its innovations with patents, and to vigorously protect and defend its patents, trademarks and know-how against infringement and unauthorized use. At the end of 2019, the Company held more than 6,000 patents. These patents expire on various dates during the period from 2020 to 2039. The expiration of any single patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nAlthough the Company believes that its products and technology do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future. Also, there can be no assurance that any patent now owned by the Company will afford protection against competitors that develop similar technology. As the Company continues to expand its products and expand into new businesses, it will increase its exposure to intellectual property claims.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company is exposed to financial risks through its operations. To reduce the financial risks and to take advantage of economies of scale, the Company has a central treasury department supporting operations and management. The treasury department handles external financial transactions and functions as the Company's in-house bank for its subsidiaries.\nThe Board of Directors monitors compliance with the financial risk policy on an on-going basis.
