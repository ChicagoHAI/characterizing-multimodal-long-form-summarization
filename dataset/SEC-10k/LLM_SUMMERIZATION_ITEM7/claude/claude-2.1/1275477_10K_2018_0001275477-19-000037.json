MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nBimini Capital Management, Inc. (\"Bimini Capital\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company that was formed in September 2003. The Company's principal operating subsidiaries are Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and Royal Palm Capital, LLC. We operate in two business segments: the asset management segment, which includes the investment advisory services provided by Bimini Advisors to Orchid, and the investment portfolio segment, which includes the investment activities conducted by Bimini Capital and Royal Palm.\nBimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (a registered investment advisor), are collectively referred to as Bimini Advisors.\u201d Bimini Advisors serves as the external manager of the portfolio of Orchid Island Capital, Inc. (\"Orchid\"). From this arrangement, the Company receives management fees and expense reimbursements. As manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid's business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors provides Orchid with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of Orchid's board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to it. In addition, the Company receives dividends from its investment in Orchid common shares.\nRoyal Palm Capital, LLC (collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries referred to as Royal Palm\u201d) maintains an investment portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") issued and guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or agency (\"Agency MBS\"). Our investment strategy focuses on, and our portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency MBS (\"PT MBS\") and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"), interest only securities (\"IOs\"), inverse interest only securities (\"IIOs\") and principal only securities (\"POs\"), among other types of structured Agency MBS.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nOn March 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of Bimini Capital Management, Inc. (the Company\u201d) approved a Stock Repurchase Plan ( Repurchase Plan\u201d). Pursuant to Repurchase Plan, the Company may purchase up to 500,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock from time to time, subject to certain limitations imposed by Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. The Repurchase Plan was originally set to expire on November 15, 2018, but was extended by the Board of Directors until November 15, 2019. The authorization for the Share Repurchase Plan may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company's Board of Directors in its discretion at any time.\nThrough December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 69,690 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $165,000, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of $2.37 per share. Subsequent to that date, and through March 20, 2019, the Company has repurchased 714 shares for a net cost of approximately $1,500 and a weighted average price of $2.16 per share.\nFactors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nA variety of industry and economic factors may impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in fair value of these instruments are presented in a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations and not included in interest expense. As such, for financial reporting purposes, interest expense and cost of funds are not impacted by the fluctuation in value of the derivative instruments.\nFor the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures, GAAP interest expense has been adjusted to reflect the realized and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative instruments the Company uses that pertain to each period presented. We believe that adjusting our interest expense for the periods presented by the gains or losses on these derivative instruments would not accurately reflect our economic interest expense for these periods. The reason is that these derivative instruments may cover periods that extend into the future, not just the current period. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses on the instruments reflect the change in market value of the instrument caused by changes in underlying interest rates applicable to the term covered by the instrument, not just the current period.\nFor each period presented, we have combined the effects of the derivative financial instruments in place for the respective period with the actual interest expense incurred on our borrowings to reflect total economic interest expense for the applicable period. Interest expense, including the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic interest expense. Net interest income, when calculated to include the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic net interest income.\n\u2003\nWe believe that economic interest expense and economic net interest income provide meaningful information to consider, in addition to the respective amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures help management to evaluate our financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio or operations. The gains or losses on derivative instruments presented in our consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily representative of the total interest rate expense that we will ultimately realize. This is because as interest rates move up or down in the future, the gains or losses we ultimately realize, and which will affect our total interest rate expense in future periods, may differ from the unrealized gains or losses recognized as of the reporting date.\nOur presentation of the economic value of our hedging strategy has important limitations. First, other market participants may calculate economic interest expense and economic net interest income differently than the way we calculate them. Second, while the we believe that the calculation of the economic value of our hedging strategy described above helps to present our financial position and performance, it may be of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, the economic value of our investment strategy should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for interest expense and net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables below present a reconciliation of the adjustments to interest expense shown for each period relative to our derivative instruments, and the consolidated statements of operations line item, gains (losses) on derivative instruments, calculated in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each quarter during 2018 and 2017.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $4.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $8.4 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $4.0 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $4.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $6.1 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $1.8 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. The $2.3 million increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a 31 basis point (\"bp\") increase in yields earned on the portfolio, combined with a $44.1 million increase in average MBS balances. The $2.2 million increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a combination of a $43.1 million increase in average repurchase liabilities and, more significantly, an 88 bp increase in cost of funds.\nOur economic interest expense on repurchase liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $4.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, resulting in $4.2 million and $3.7 million of economic net portfolio interest income, respectively.\nThe tables below provide information on our portfolio average balances, interest income, yield on assets, average repurchase agreement balances, interest expense, cost of funds, net interest income and net interest rate spread for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on both a GAAP and economic basis.\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$4.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our average cost of funds was 2.08% and 1.20% for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was an 88 bp increase in the average cost of funds and a $43.1 million increase in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur economic interest expense was $4.2 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was a 58 bp increase in the average economic cost of funds to 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 1.59% for the previous year. The $1.8 million increase in economic interest expense was due to the $43.1 million increase in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the favorable performance of our derivative agreements attributed to the current period.\nSince all of our repurchase agreements are short-term, changes in market rates directly affect our interest expense. Our average cost of funds calculated on a GAAP basis was 5 bps above average one-month LIBOR and 30 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Our average economic cost of funds was 21 bps below average one-month LIBOR and 56 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The average term to maturity of the outstanding repurchase agreements decreased from 38 days at December 31, 2017 to 31 days at December 31, 2018.\nThe tables below present the average outstanding balance under all repurchase agreements, interest expense and average economic cost of funds, and average one-month and six-month LIBOR rates for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended

However, we have sold, and may continue to sell, existing assets to acquire new assets, which our management believes might have higher risk-adjusted returns in light of current or anticipated interest rates, federal government programs or general economic conditions or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset/liability management strategy.

Fluctuations in value of retained interests are primarily driven by projections of future interest rates (the forward LIBOR curve), the discount rate used to determine the present value of the residual cash flows and prepayment and loss estimates on the underlying mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded gains on retained interests of $1.1 million compared to gains of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company exercised its optional early termination rights and received net distributions of approximately $1.4 million. That distribution, along with the cash flow of approximately $0.4 million received prior to the exercise, resulted in a gain of $1.1 million for the year that was recorded in gains on retained interests in securitizations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our total operating expenses were approximately $6.4 million compared to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During 2018, Orchid's book value and monthly dividend decreased significantly, which caused decreases in management fee revenue and dividend income on Orchid stock. Because of this decrease in cash flows, management has revised its estimated utilization of NOL carryforwards in future periods, resulting in an increase in the deferred tax valuation asset allowance.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted, so accordingly, we recorded an income tax provision of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including a charge of $25.9 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the tax rate reduction.\nFinancial Condition:\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nAs of December 31, 2018, our MBS portfolio consisted of $212.4 million of agency or government MBS at fair value and had a weighted average coupon of 4.25%. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received principal repayments of $23.5 million compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average prepayment speeds for the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 6.6% and 8.8%, respectively.\nThe following table presents the 3-month constant prepayment rate ( CPR\u201d) experienced on our structured and PT MBS sub-portfolios, on an annualized basis, for the quarterly periods presented. CPR is a method of expressing the prepayment rate for a mortgage pool that assumes that a constant fraction of the remaining principal is prepaid each month or year. Specifically, the CPR in the chart below represents the three month prepayment rate of the securities in the respective asset category. Assets that were not owned for the entire quarter have been excluded from the calculation. The exclusion of certain assets during periods of high trading activity can create a very high, and often volatile, reliance on a small sample of underlying loans.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

We generally seek to acquire low duration assets that offer high levels of protection from mortgage prepayments provided they are reasonably priced by the market. Although the duration of an individual asset can change as a result of changes in interest rates, we strive to maintain a hedged PT MBS portfolio with an effective duration of less than 2.0. The stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of PT MBS generally ranges up to 30 years. However, the effect of prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans tends to shorten the resulting cash flows from our investments substantially. Prepayments occur for various reasons, including refinancing of underlying mortgages, loan payoffs in connection with home sales, and borrowers paying more than their scheduled loan payments, which accelerates the amortization of the loans.\nThe duration of our IO and IIO portfolio will vary greatly depending on the structural features of the securities. While prepayment activity will always affect the cash flows associated with the securities, the interest only nature of IO's may cause their durations to become extremely negative when prepayments are high, and less negative when prepayments are low. Prepayments affect the durations of IIO's similarly, but the floating rate nature of the coupon of IIOs (which is inversely related to the level of one month LIBOR) cause their price movements - and model duration - to be affected by changes in both prepayments and one month LIBOR - both current and anticipated levels. As a result, the duration of IIO securities will also vary greatly.\nPrepayments on the loans underlying our MBS can alter the timing of the cash flows received by us. As a result, we gauge the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by measuring their effective duration. While modified duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to movements in interest rates, effective duration captures both the movement in interest rates and the fact that cash flows to a mortgage related security are altered when interest rates move. Accordingly, when the contract interest rate on a mortgage loan is substantially above prevailing interest rates in the market, the effective duration of securities collateralized by such loans can be quite low because of expected prepayments.\nWe face the risk that the market value of our PT MBS assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our structured MBS or liabilities, including our hedging instruments. Accordingly, we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. We generally calculate duration and effective duration using various third party models or obtain these quotes from third parties. However, empirical results and various third-party models may produce different duration numbers for the same securities.\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedge positions as of December 31, 2018, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 bps, rise 100 bps and rise 200 bps, adjusted to reflect the impact of convexity, which is the measure of the sensitivity of our hedge positions and Agency MBS' effective duration to movements in interest rates.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td>

We believe these facilities provide borrowing capacity in excess of our needs. None of these lenders are affiliated with the Company. These borrowings are secured by our MBS and cash.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had obligations outstanding under the repurchase agreements of approximately $200.4 million with a net weighted average borrowing cost of 2.56%. The remaining maturity of our outstanding repurchase agreement obligations ranged from 9 to 50 days, with a weighted average maturity of 31 days. Securing the repurchase agreement obligation as of December 31, 2018 are MBS with an estimated fair value, including accrued interest, of $213.1 million and a weighted average maturity of 322 months, and cash posted as collateral of $230,000. Through March 20, 2019, we have been able to maintain our repurchase facilities with comparable terms to those that existed at December 31, 2018 with maturities through June 7, 2019.\nThe table below presents information about our period-end and average repurchase agreement obligations for each quarter in 2018 and 2017.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ending\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maximum\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Difference Between Ending\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Repurchase Agreements and\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Repurchase Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,396\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,746\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,673\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.83\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 203,742\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 204,988\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 189,582\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,160\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 175,422\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 193,753\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 184,621\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,199\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.98\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 193,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 204,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 197,001\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.61\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 200,183\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 201,291\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 193,778\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 187,374\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 187,505\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 161,003\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,371\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.38\n</td> <td> %(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 134,633\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 134,669\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 126,341\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,292\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,049\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 121,877\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 119,938\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,889\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.57\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The higher ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 reflects the growth of the portfolio. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company's investment in PT MBS increased $56.1 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is our ability to turn non-cash assets into cash, purchase additional investments, repay principal and interest on borrowings, fund overhead and fulfill margin calls. Our principal immediate sources of liquidity include cash balances, unencumbered assets, the availability to borrow under repurchase agreements, and fees and dividends received from Orchid. Our borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our interest earning assets varies. Our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on-going basis through payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio. As further described in Note 4 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company exercised its optional early termination rights and received net distributions of approximately $1.4 million. That distribution, along with the cash flow of approximately $0.4 million received prior to the exercise, resulted in a gain of $1.1 million for the year that was recorded in gains on retained interests in securitizations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Historically, the ongoing regular cash flows from these retained interest positions provided the Company with liquidity, however, the predictability of such cash flows diminished during 2018 which contributed to the decision to terminate and collect a one-time final distribution. Future cash flows from the remaining unterminated positions is expected to be negligible. Management believes that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for (a) the acquisition of additional investments consistent with the size and nature of our existing MBS portfolio, (b) the repayments on borrowings, (c) the payment of overhead and operating expenses, and the payment of other accrued obligations.\nOur strategy for hedging our funding costs typically involves taking short positions in Eurodollar futures, T-Note futures, swaptions or other instruments. Since inception we have primarily used short positions in Eurodollar futures. When the market causes these short positions to decline in value we are required to meet margin calls with cash. This can reduce our liquidity position to the extent other securities in our portfolio move in price in such a way that we do not receive enough cash through margin calls to offset the Eurodollar related margin calls. If this were to occur in sufficient magnitude, the loss of liquidity might force us to reduce the size of the levered portfolio, pledge additional structured securities to raise funds or risk operating the portfolio with less liquidity.\nOur master repurchase agreements have no stated expiration, but can be terminated at any time at our option or at the option of the counterparty. However, once a definitive repurchase agreement under a master repurchase agreement has been entered into, it generally may not be terminated by either party. A negotiated termination can occur, but may involve a fee to be paid by the party seeking to terminate the repurchase agreement transaction.\nUnder our repurchase agreement funding arrangements, we are required to post margin at the initiation of the borrowing. The margin posted represents the haircut, which is a percentage of the market value of the collateral pledged. To the extent the market value of the asset collateralizing the financing transaction declines, the market value of our posted margin will be insufficient and we will be required to post additional collateral. Conversely, if the market value of the asset pledged increases in value, we would be over collateralized and we would be entitled to have excess margin returned to us by the counterparty. Our lenders typically value our pledged securities daily to ensure the adequacy of our margin and make margin calls as needed, as do we. Typically, but not always, the parties agree to a minimum threshold amount for margin calls so as to avoid the need for nuisance margin calls on a daily basis. Our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis.\nAs discussed above, we invest a portion of our capital in structured MBS. We generally do not apply leverage to this portion of our portfolio. The leverage inherent in structured securities replaces the leverage obtained by acquiring PT securities and funding them in the repurchase market. This structured MBS strategy has been a core element of the Company's overall investment strategy since 2008. However, we have and may continue to pledge a portion of our structured MBS in order to raise our cash levels, but generally will not pledge these securities in order to acquire additional assets.\nIn future periods we expect to continue to finance our activities through repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 million. We generated cash flows of $31.8 million from principal and interest payments on our MBS portfolio and had average repurchase agreements outstanding of $193.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $7.8 million in management fees and expense reimbursements as manager of Orchid and approximately $1.6 million in dividends from our investment in Orchid common stock. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $1.4 million in connection with the termination of certain securitizations associated with our retained interests. We do not expect to generate cash in similar transactions in future periods.\nThe table below summarizes the effect that certain future contractual obligations existing as of December 31, 2018 will have on our liquidity and cash flows.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Obligations Maturing\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Within\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to Three\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to Five\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than Five\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,396\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,396\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on repurchase agreements(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,031\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,031\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on junior subordinated notes(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,726\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,320\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,194\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,403\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,320\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 255,871\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Interest expense on repurchase agreements and junior subordinated notes are based on current interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and the remaining term of liabilities existing at that date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The Company holds a common equity interest in Bimini Capital Trust II.

In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for direct expenses paid on its behalf and to pay to us Orchid's pro rata share of overhead as defined in the management agreement. As a stockholder of Orchid, we will also continue to share in distributions, if any, paid by Orchid to its stockholders. Our operating results are also impacted by changes in the market value of our holdings of Orchid common shares, although these market value changes do not impact our cash flows from Orchid.\nThe independent Board of Directors of Orchid has the ability to terminate the management agreement and thus end our ability to collect management fees and share overhead costs. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will pay us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the current automatic renewal term.\nInterest Rates and the MBS Market\nThe fourth quarter of 2018 was pivotal. The trajectory of the growth rate of the U.S. economy, the level of interest rates, and expectations for monetary policy on the part of the Federal Reserve (the Fed\u201d) changed dramatically during the quarter. In early October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the Dow\u201d) hit an all-time high level, West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) crude hit a multi-year high, the unemployment rate dropped to a 49-year low and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a multi-year high yield. The Fed appeared fully committed to extending its rate hike regime as Chairman Powell stated the Fed was a long way from neutral at this point,\u201d and that we may go past neutral.\u201d The market fully expected the Fed to continue its gradual rate hikes into 2019 at that point, although market pricing reflected two additional rate hikes in 2019 versus the three reflected in the Fed's Dot Plots.\u201d Over the course of the quarter, the outlook changed dramatically.\nOver the first two months of the fourth quarter conditions that had previously been supportive of this outlook changed. Growth rates in a few countries in Europe were slightly negative in Q3 of 2018. Industrial production, the primary engine of growth for key export-oriented countries in the European Union, turned negative on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Growth in China slowed over the course of the year as each successive quarter was lower than the last, finally hitting 6.4% for the fourth quarter of 2018. China's growth rate for the entire year was the lowest in 28 years. Earnings reports released by many large US corporations for the third quarter, released in October and November, contained generally down-beat forward guidance. Management teams frequently referenced both the effects of tariffs imposed on imports during 2018 and slowing growth in Europe, China and the balance of global markets. Domestic economic data - outside of labor market related data - softened, especially the ISM data released in early December (for the month of November), which showed one of the sharpest declines in many years. The final development that shook the markets was the partial government shutdown, which lasted a record 5 weeks. As the year came to a close all risk markets performed very badly. The equity markets in the US, as measured by the broad indices - the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq - erased essentially all of their year-to-date gains and entered bear-market territory. Commodity prices declined, with WTI crude oil decreasing by over 43% (peak to trough) during the quarter. Liquidity in risk markets - typically low over the course of the last two weeks of the year due to holiday absences - was acutely poor in late 2018. Funding levels over the turn of the year were abnormally high - and in extreme instances more than double levels seen earlier in the year. The yield on the 10-year US treasury note rallied by over 68 bps - peak to trough - during the quarter. By the end of the year market pricing - as reflected in Fed funds futures - was for a cut in rates from the current level at some point over 2019 and 2020.\nThe Fed took notice of the material change in market sentiment that occurred over the course of the quarter. The Fed did raise rates at its December meeting - the ninth increase for the current cycle which began in December of 2015. However, the tone of the Fed, as reflected in both its press release issued at the conclusion of the meeting and during Chairman Powell's press conference - seemed to have changed. The Chairman stated that the Fed now saw the current level of the overnight Fed funds rate as being at the bottom end of the range of what it considered neutral. The Chairman acknowledged the FOMC's awareness of ongoing market events. Finally, at its January 2019 meeting, the Fed stated its policy rate is now in the range of the FOMC's estimate of neutral. More importantly, the FOMC now viewed itself as data dependent and that market conditions would determine its next move, whether that be a rate hike or cut. This represented a dramatic shift in the Fed policy outlook and was perceived as quite dovish by the markets. Risk markets quickly rallied and have continued to do so in early 2019.\nAs we enter 2019, the outlook is far different than it was at the end of the third quarter. The risks to the economic outlook - at least in the eyes of the market - are now clearly to the downside. Risks include a potential hard Brexit\u201d for the United Kingdom from the European Union, very weak growth in Europe and China, the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, and the prospect that all of these factors will cause growth in the U.S. to slow materially. The market now sees at most one more Fed rate hike in 2019 and likely cuts by the end of 2020.\nThe Agency MBS market reacted to market developments during the fourth quarter of 2018 negatively before the market turmoil became severe during the last five weeks of the quarter. The current coupon, 30-year fixed rate Agency MBS traded at a spread of approximately 0.74% to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note on October 3, 2018, but then widened to spread just above 0.90% on November 23, 2018. As the market turmoil intensified and interest rates began a sharp rally in late November, the current coupon Agency MBS performed well and ended the quarter at a spread to the same U.S. Treasury benchmark of approximately 0.82% and eventually reached 0.75% by the end of January 2019. For the quarter, the Bloomberg Agency MBS index returned 2.08%, and 0.99% for the full year of 2018. However, the performance was very uneven among the various coupons and maturities of the index. Lower coupon securities performed much better than higher coupon securities owing to the worse convexity and increased prepayment expectations of higher coupon securities. As was the case at the end of the third quarter of 2018, recent production of Agency MBS has frequently had characteristics that negatively impact the anticipated total returns of the securities. In this case the spread between the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgage loans and the net rate received by the investor is quite high. This leads to higher prepayment activity for the given coupon versus more typical spreads. Also, average loan balances appear higher than what market participants are accustomed to and average FICO scores are higher as well. All three of these factors tend to increase prepayment expectations and negatively impact expected returns for the securities. This concern was heightened as the Mortgage Bankers Association's refi index, after declining during the fourth quarter from approximately 950 at the beginning of the quarter to below 750 at the end of the quarter, increased dramatically to near 1180 during January 2019. Going forward, with prevailing mortgage rates available to borrowers now below 4.5%, versus 4.94% for the week of November 8, 2018, combined with the fact seasonal refinancing activity is due to increase in the coming months, we believe that the prepayment characteristics of various securities will be the driver of relative performance.\nRecent Regulatory Developments\nIn September 2017, the FOMC announced that it would implement a balance sheet normalization policy by gradually decreasing the Fed's reinvestment of U.S. Treasuries and Agency MBS. More specifically, principal payments received by the Fed will be reinvested only to the extent they exceed gradually rising caps until the FOMC determines that the Fed is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. In October 2017, the FOMC commenced this balance sheet normalization program. In October 2018, the Fed reached its terminal cap of $20 billion per month. Going forward, the Fed will only purchase Agency MBS to the extent paydowns on the Fed's holdings exceed $20 billion in any given month. These steps have been referred to as the Fed's balance sheet normalization.\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made statements following the January 2019 meeting that the Fed is evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of the balance sheet normalization and will finalize its plan to do so at a later meeting. In its January 30, 2019 release, the Fed said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\nIn 2017, policymakers announced that LIBOR will be replaced by 2021. The directive was spurred by the fact that banks are uncomfortable contributing to the LIBOR panel given the shortage of underlying transactions on which to base levels and the liability associated with submitting an unfounded level. LIBOR will be replaced with a new SOFR, a rate based on U.S. repo trading. The new benchmark rate will be based on overnight Treasury General Collateral repo rates. The rate-setting process will be managed and published by the Fed and the Treasury's Office of Financial Research. Many banks believe that it may take four to five years to complete the transition to SOFR, despite the 2021 deadline. We will monitor the emergence of this new rate carefully as it will likely become the new benchmark for hedges and a range of interest rate investments.\nIn January 2019, the Trump administration made statements of its plans to work with Congress to overhaul Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and expectations to announce a framework for the development of a policy for comprehensive housing finance reform soon. At this time, however, no decisions have been made on any reform plan.\nThe scope and nature of the actions the U.S. government or the Fed will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve. Although the Trump administration has made statements of its intentions to reform housing finance and tax policy, many of these potential policy changes will require congressional action. In addition, the Fed has made statements regarding additional increases to the Federal Funds Rate in 2019 and beyond.\nEffect on Us\nRegulatory developments, movements in interest rates and prepayment rates affect us in many ways, including the following:\nEffects on our Assets\nA change in or elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may increase our costs (if, for example, guarantee fees increase) or require us to change our investment strategy altogether. For example, the elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may cause us to change our investment strategy to focus on non-Agency MBS, which in turn would require us to significantly increase our monitoring of the credit risks of our investments in addition to interest rate and prepayment risks.\nLower long-term interest rates can affect the value of our Agency MBS in a number of ways. If prepayment rates are relatively low (due, in part, to the refinancing problems described above), lower long-term interest rates can increase the value of higher-coupon Agency MBS. This is because investors typically place a premium on assets with yields that are higher than market yields. Although lower long-term interest rates may increase asset values in our portfolio, we may not be able to invest new funds in similarly-yielding assets.\nIf prepayment levels increase, the value of our Agency MBS affected by such prepayments may decline. This is because a principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency MBS, which would shorten the period during which an investor would receive above-market returns (assuming the yield on the prepaid asset is higher than market yields). Also, prepayment proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in similar-yielding assets. Agency MBS backed by mortgages with high interest rates are more susceptible to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are most likely to refinance to a lower rate. IOs and IIOs, however, may be the types of Agency MBS most sensitive to increased prepayment rates. Because the holder of an IO or IIO receives no principal payments, the values of IOs and IIOs are entirely dependent on the existence of a principal balance on the underlying mortgages. If the principal balance is eliminated due to prepayment, IOs and IIOs essentially become worthless. Although increased prepayment rates can negatively affect the value of our IOs and IIOs, they have the opposite effect on POs. Because POs act like zero-coupon bonds, meaning they are purchased at a discount to their par value and have an effective interest rate based on the discount and the term of the underlying loan, an increase in prepayment rates would reduce the effective term of our POs and accelerate the yields earned on those assets, which would increase our net income.\nHigher long-term rates can also affect the value of our Agency MBS. As long-term rates rise, rates available to borrowers also rise. This tends to cause prepayment activity to slow and extend the expected average life of mortgage cash flows. As the expected average life of the mortgage cash flows increases, coupled with higher discount rates, the value of Agency MBS declines. Some of the instruments the Company uses to hedge our Agency MBS assets, such as Euro Dollar futures, swaps, interest rate futures and swaptions, are stable average life instruments. This means that to the extent we use such instruments to hedge our Agency MBS assets, our hedges may not adequately protect us from price declines, and therefore may negatively impact our book value. It is for this reason we use interest only securities in our portfolio. As interest rates rise, the expected average life of these securities increases, causing generally positive price movements as the number and size of the cash flows increase the longer the underlying mortgages remain outstanding. This makes interest only securities desirable hedge instruments for pass-through Agency MBS.\nAs the economy has rebounded from the financial crisis, the Fed has taken steps to remove the considerable accommodation that was employed to combat the crisis. At the conclusion of its meeting in September 2017, the Fed announced it would implement caps on the amount of Agency MBS assets it would allow to run off, or not be re-invested, starting in October 2017. Previously the Fed would re-invest all of the principal repayments it received each month on the Agency MBS assets it had acquired during its quantitative easing programs. By capping the amount they would allow to run off each month, the Fed was effectively limiting the amount it would re-invest. Pursuant to the Fed's September 2017 announcement, the cap reached $20 billion per month in October 2018. At the time of the Fed's announcement in September 2017, its monthly re-investments were approximately $20 billion per month as well, so this implied the Fed would stop, or nearly stop, re-investing its monthly pay-downs beyond October 2018. The purchases each month by the Fed have been a significant source of demand in the Agency MBS market and as it is reduced slowly over the course of 2018 and essentially eliminated beyond October 2018, the removal of this source of demand could negatively impact Agency MBS prices. The extent this negatively impacts the Agency MBS market will be a function of the level of supply each month - as the supply/demand balance affects the price of any asset - and whether or not another source of demand emerges to replace the Fed. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made statements following the January 2019 meeting that the Fed is evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of the balance sheet normalization and will finalize its plan to do so at a later meeting. In its January 30, 2019 release, the Fed said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\u2003\nBecause we base our investment decisions on risk management principles rather than anticipated movements in interest rates, in a volatile interest rate environment we may allocate more capital to structured Agency MBS with shorter durations, such as short-term fixed and floating rate CMOs. We believe these securities have a lower sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates than other asset classes. We may attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates by investing in IOs and IIOs, which typically have different sensitivities to changes in long-term interest rates than PT MBS, particularly PT MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages.\nEffects on our borrowing costs\nWe leverage our PT MBS portfolio and a portion of our structured Agency MBS with principal balances through the use of short-term repurchase agreement transactions. The interest rates on our debt are determined by market levels of both the Federal Funds Rate and LIBOR. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR would increase our borrowing costs, which could affect our interest rate spread if there is no corresponding increase in the interest we earn on our assets. This would be most prevalent with respect to our Agency MBS backed by fixed rate mortgage loans because the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage loan does not change even though market rates may change.\nIn order to protect our net interest margin against increases in short-term interest rates, we may enter into interest rate swaps, which economically convert our floating-rate repurchase agreement debt to fixed-rate debt, or utilize other hedging instruments such as Eurodollar and T-Note futures contracts or interest rate swaptions.\nSummary\nThe U.S. economy appears to have fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008. Growth has accelerated, reaching 4% annualized in the second quarter of 2018 and 3.4% in the third quarter. The economic data has in many cases reached multi-year or, in some cases, multi-decade levels. The economy appeared to have considerable momentum as it entered the fourth quarter. The Fed raised rates for the ninth time at its December meeting and, up until then, seemed intent on continuing to do so into 2020. This trajectory abruptly changed during the fourth quarter due to a combination of factors. Growth in Europe and China slowed significantly throughout 2018 and hit a recent trough late in the year. Great Britain is faced with the potential for a hard Brexit\u201d from the European Union, the federal government had a five week partial shutdown around the turn of the year and domestic economic data, at least non-labor market related data, has softened. Financial markets in the U.S. and globally experienced significant turmoil during the fourth quarter with returns for the year generally erased entirely. Interest rates, after hitting multi-year highs early in the quarter, declined by over 60 bps in the case of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. The policy stance of the Fed has changed to a balanced outlook, with data dependency the driver of further rate decisions - whether up or down.\nThe Bloomberg Agency MBS index generated a return of 2.08% for the quarter, although this return number masks the fact the performance of the sector was very uneven, both in time and across the various securities that make up the index. The Agency MBS market performed poorly though the end of November, as the spread of the 30-year, current coupon Agency MBS widened in spread to the 10-year U.S. treasury note by over 0.15%. However, as the market turmoil became more severe and rates rallied close to 2.50% in the case of the 10-year note - versus above 3.20% at the beginning of the quarter - Agency MBS did very well (as an index). However, with the decline in rates prepayment fears and convexity concerns intensified, resulting in very uneven performance for the index. Longer duration, lower coupon securities performed very well, while higher coupon, shorter duration securities performed quite badly. Given the new rate environment and lack of concern surrounding future rate hikes, we believe that the mortgage market will be driven by prepayment characteristics going forward.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires our management to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments which could significantly affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management has identified its most critical accounting estimates:\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nOur investments in MBS are accounted for under the fair value option. We acquire our MBS for the purpose of generating long-term returns, and not for the short-term investment of idle capital. Changes in the fair value of securities accounted for under the fair value option are reflected as part of our net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations, as opposed to a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of stockholder's equity if they were instead reclassified as available-for-sale securities. We elected to account for all of our MBS under the fair value option in order to reflect changes in the fair value of our MBS in our consolidated statement of operations, which we believe more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period. GAAP requires the use of a three-level valuation hierarchy to disclose the classification of fair value measurements used for determining the fair value of our MBS. These levels include:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company- specific data. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur MBS are valued using Level 2 valuations, and such valuations currently are determined based on independent pricing sources and/or third party broker quotes when available. Because the price estimates may vary, management must make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use to calculate the fair values. Alternatively, the Company could opt to have the value of all of our positions in MBS determined by either an independent third-party or do so internally. In managing our portfolio, the Company employs the following four-step process at each valuation date to determine the fair value of our MBS.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> First, the Company obtains fair values from subscription-based independent pricing services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Second, the Company requests non-binding quotes from one to four broker-dealers for certain MBS in order to validate the values obtained by the pricing service. The Company requests these quotes from broker-dealers that actively trade and make markets in the respective asset class for which the quote is requested.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Third, the Company reviews the values obtained by the pricing source and the broker-dealers for consistency across similar assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Finally, if the data from the pricing services and broker-dealers is not homogenous or if the data obtained is inconsistent with management's market observations, the Company makes a judgment to determine which price appears the most consistent with observed prices from similar assets and selects that price. To the extent management believes that none of the prices are consistent with observed prices for similar assets, which is typically the case for only an immaterial portion of our portfolio each quarter, the Company may use a third price that is consistent with observed prices for identical or similar assets. In the case of assets that have quoted prices such as Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages, the Company generally uses the quoted or observed market price. For assets such as Agency MBS backed by ARMs or structured Agency MBS, the Company may determine the price based on the yield or spread that is identical to an observed transaction or a similar asset for which a dealer mark or subscription-based price has been obtained.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes its pricing methodology to be consistent with the definition of fair value described in FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nInvestment in Orchid Island Capital, Inc. Common Stock\nThe Company has elected the fair value option for its investment in Orchid common shares. The change in the fair value of this investment and dividends received on this investment are reflected in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the fair value of our investment in Orchid on a market approach using Level 1\u201d inputs based on the quoted market price of Orchid's common stock on the NYSE. Electing the fair value option requires the Company to record changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations, which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period and is consistent with how the investment is managed.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nRetained interests in the subordinated tranches of securities created in securitization transactions were initially recorded at their fair value when issued by Royal Palm. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are reflected in earnings. Quoted market prices for these assets are generally not available, so the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management's best estimates of key assumptions, which include expected credit losses, prepayment speeds, weighted-average life, and discount rates commensurate with the inherent risks of the asset.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate asset/liability strategies and manage other exposures, and we may continue to do so in the future. The principal instruments that we have used to date are T-Note and Eurodollar futures contracts and interest rate swaptions, but we may enter into other derivatives in the future.\nWe have elected not to treat any of our derivative financial instruments as hedges in order to align the accounting treatment of our derivative instruments with the treatment of our portfolio assets under the fair value option election. FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging, requires that all derivative instruments be carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in earnings for each period.\nIncome Recognition\nAll of our MBS are either PT MBS or structured MBS, including CMOs, IOs, IIOs or POs. Income on PT MBS, POs and CMOs that contain principal balances is based on the stated interest rate of the security. As a result of accounting for our MBS under the fair value option, premium or discount present at the date of purchase is not amortized. For IOs, IIOs and CMOs that do not contain principal balances, income is accrued based on the carrying value and the effective yield. As cash is received it is first applied to accrued interest and then to reduce the carrying value of the security. At each reporting date, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively from the reporting period based on the new estimate of prepayments, current interest rates and current asset prices. The new effective yield is calculated based on the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, the new prepayment estimates and the contractual terms of the security. Changes in fair value of all of our MBS during the period are recorded in earnings and reported as unrealized gains or losses on mortgage-backed securities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For IIO securities, effective yield and income recognition calculations also take into account the index value applicable to the security.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The measurement of net deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance if, based on the Company's evaluation, it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. A majority of the Company's net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by the revenue forecasts of management fees, Orchid dividends and net interest income, and the subsequent reinvestment of those amounts into the MBS portfolio over the extended period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could lead management to reassess its valuation allowance conclusions.\nThe Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for years ended on or after December 31, 2015 remain open for examination. Although management believes its calculations for tax returns are correct and the positions taken thereon are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits could be materially different from the tax returns filed by the Company, and those differences could result in significant costs or benefits to the Company.\nThe Company measures, recognizes and presents its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under that guidance, the Company assesses the likelihood, based on their technical merit, that tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the facts, circumstances and information available at the end of each period. The measurement of uncertain tax positions is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that requires a change. The Company recognizes tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit and is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within the income tax provision.\nCapital Expenditures\nAt December 31, 2018, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nBimini Capital Management, Inc. (\"Bimini Capital\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company that was formed in September 2003. The Company's principal operating subsidiaries are Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and Royal Palm Capital, LLC. We operate in two business segments: the asset management segment, which includes the investment advisory services provided by Bimini Advisors to Orchid, and the investment portfolio segment, which includes the investment activities conducted by Bimini Capital and Royal Palm.\nBimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (a registered investment advisor), are collectively referred to as Bimini Advisors.\u201d Bimini Advisors serves as the external manager of the portfolio of Orchid Island Capital, Inc. (\"Orchid\"). From this arrangement, the Company receives management fees and expense reimbursements. As manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid's business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors provides Orchid with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of Orchid's board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to it. In addition, the Company receives dividends from its investment in Orchid common shares.\nRoyal Palm Capital, LLC (collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries referred to as Royal Palm\u201d) maintains an investment portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") issued and guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or agency (\"Agency MBS\"). Our investment strategy focuses on, and our portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency MBS (\"PT MBS\") and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"), interest only securities (\"IOs\"), inverse interest only securities (\"IIOs\") and principal only securities (\"POs\"), among other types of structured Agency MBS.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nOn March 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of Bimini Capital Management, Inc. (the Company\u201d) approved a Stock Repurchase Plan ( Repurchase Plan\u201d). Pursuant to Repurchase Plan, the Company may purchase up to 500,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock from time to time, subject to certain limitations imposed by Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. The Repurchase Plan was originally set to expire on November 15, 2018, but was extended by the Board of Directors until November 15, 2019. The authorization for the Share Repurchase Plan may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company's Board of Directors in its discretion at any time.\nThrough December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 69,690 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $165,000, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of $2.37 per share. Subsequent to that date, and through March 20, 2019, the Company has repurchased 714 shares for a net cost of approximately $1,500 and a weighted average price of $2.16 per share.\nFactors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nA variety of industry and economic factors may impact our results of operations and financial condition. These factors include:\n \u00b7 interest rate trends; \n \u00b7 the difference between Agency MBS yields and our funding and hedging costs; \n \u00b7 competition for investments in Agency MBS; \n \u00b7 actions taken by the U.S. government, including the presidential administration, the Federal Reserve (the Fed\u201d), the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC\u201d) and the U.S. Treasury; \n \u00b7 prepayment rates on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS, and credit trends insofar as they affect prepayment rates; \n \u00b7 the equity markets and the ability of Orchid to raise additional capital; and \n \u00b7 other market developments. \nIn addition, a variety of factors relating to our business may also impact our results of operations and financial condition. These factors include:\n \u00b7 our degree of leverage; \n \u00b7 our access to funding and borrowing capacity; \n \u00b7 our borrowing costs; \n \u00b7 our hedging activities; \n \u00b7 the market value of our investments; \n \u00b7 the requirements to qualify for a registration exemption under the Investment Company Act; \n \u00b7 our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income; \n \u00b7 the impact of possible future changes in tax laws; and \n \u00b7 our ability to manage the portfolio of Orchid and maintain our role as manager. \nResults of Operations\nDescribed below are the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Loss Summary\nConsolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $26.8 million, or $2.10 basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Common Stock, as compared to consolidated net loss of $16.5 million, or $1.30 basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Common Stock, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe components of net loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, along with the changes in those components are presented in the table below:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advisory services revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,771\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,431\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and dividend income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,988\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,573\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,415\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,520\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,033\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,239\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,971\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (732\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11,448\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,673\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7,775\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (39\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income before income tax provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,651\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,895\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,127\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,378\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,749\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,483\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,295\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nEconomic Interest Expense and Economic Net Interest Income\nWe use derivative instruments, specifically Eurodollar and Treasury Note ( T-Note\u201d) futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk on our repurchase agreements and junior subordinate notes in a rising rate environment.\nWe have not elected to designate our derivative holdings for hedge accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in fair value of these instruments are presented in a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations and not included in interest expense. As such, for financial reporting purposes, interest expense and cost of funds are not impacted by the fluctuation in value of the derivative instruments.\nFor the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures, GAAP interest expense has been adjusted to reflect the realized and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative instruments the Company uses that pertain to each period presented. We believe that adjusting our interest expense for the periods presented by the gains or losses on these derivative instruments would not accurately reflect our economic interest expense for these periods. The reason is that these derivative instruments may cover periods that extend into the future, not just the current period. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses on the instruments reflect the change in market value of the instrument caused by changes in underlying interest rates applicable to the term covered by the instrument, not just the current period.\nFor each period presented, we have combined the effects of the derivative financial instruments in place for the respective period with the actual interest expense incurred on our borrowings to reflect total economic interest expense for the applicable period. Interest expense, including the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic interest expense. Net interest income, when calculated to include the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic net interest income.\n\u2003\nWe believe that economic interest expense and economic net interest income provide meaningful information to consider, in addition to the respective amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures help management to evaluate our financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio or operations. The gains or losses on derivative instruments presented in our consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily representative of the total interest rate expense that we will ultimately realize. This is because as interest rates move up or down in the future, the gains or losses we ultimately realize, and which will affect our total interest rate expense in future periods, may differ from the unrealized gains or losses recognized as of the reporting date.\nOur presentation of the economic value of our hedging strategy has important limitations. First, other market participants may calculate economic interest expense and economic net interest income differently than the way we calculate them. Second, while the we believe that the calculation of the economic value of our hedging strategy described above helps to present our financial position and performance, it may be of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, the economic value of our investment strategy should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for interest expense and net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables below present a reconciliation of the adjustments to interest expense shown for each period relative to our derivative instruments, and the consolidated statements of operations line item, gains (losses) on derivative instruments, calculated in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each quarter during 2018 and 2017.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>

The management agreement has been renewed through February 2020 and provides for automatic one-year extension options. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will pay to us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the automatic renewal term.\nThe following table summarizes the advisory services revenue received from Orchid for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and each quarter during 2018 and 2017.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Advisory Services\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Orchid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Orchid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Management\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> MBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Allocation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,264,230\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 395,911\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,404\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,838\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,601,776\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 431,962\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,482\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,873\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,717,690\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 469,974\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,606\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,967\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,745,298\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 488,906\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,712\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,093\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,837,575\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 459,322\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,625\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,033\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,834,083\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 441,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,940\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,499,922\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 406,395\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,788\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,142,095\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 371,691\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,302\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,670\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,582,249\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 446,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,204\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,567\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,771\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,578,419\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 419,650\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,855\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,576\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,431\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio Segment\nNet Portfolio Interest Income\nWe define net portfolio interest income as interest income on MBS less interest expense on repurchase agreement funding. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $4.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $8.4 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $4.0 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $4.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $6.1 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $1.8 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. The $2.3 million increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a 31 basis point (\"bp\") increase in yields earned on the portfolio, combined with a $44.1 million increase in average MBS balances. The $2.2 million increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a combination of a $43.1 million increase in average repurchase liabilities and, more significantly, an 88 bp increase in cost of funds.\nOur economic interest expense on repurchase liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $4.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, resulting in $4.2 million and $3.7 million of economic net portfolio interest income, respectively.\nThe tables below provide information on our portfolio average balances, interest income, yield on assets, average repurchase agreement balances, interest expense, cost of funds, net interest income and net interest rate spread for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on

income was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $6.1 million for year ended December 31, 2017. Average MBS holdings were $203.2 million and $159.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $2.3 million increase in interest income was due to a 31 bp increase in yields, combined with a $44.1 million increase in average MBS holdings. Interest rates were generally higher in 2018 than in 2017. This pertains not only to yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, but also on Agency MBS as well.\nThe table below presents the average portfolio size, income and yields of our respective

$4.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our average cost of funds was 2.08% and 1.20% for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was an 88 bp increase in the average cost of funds and a $43.1 million increase in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur economic interest expense was $4.2 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was a 58 bp increase in the average economic cost of funds to 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 1.59% for the previous year. The $1.8 million increase in economic interest expense was due to the $43.1 million increase in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the favorable performance of our derivative agreements attributed to the current period.\nSince all of our repurchase agreements are short-term, changes in market rates directly affect our interest expense. Our average cost of funds calculated on a GAAP basis was 5 bps above average one-month LIBOR and 30 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Our average economic cost of funds was 21 bps below average one-month LIBOR and 56 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The average term to maturity of the outstanding repurchase agreements decreased from 38 days at December 31, 2017 to 31 days at December 31, 2018.\nThe tables below present the average outstanding balance under all repurchase agreements, interest expense and average economic cost of funds, and average one-month and six-month LIBOR rates for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended

Fluctuations in value of retained interests are primarily driven by projections of future interest rates (the forward LIBOR curve), the discount rate used to determine the present value of the residual cash flows and prepayment and loss estimates on the underlying mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded gains on retained interests of $1.1 million compared to gains of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company exercised its optional early termination rights and received net distributions of approximately $1.4 million. That distribution, along with the cash flow of approximately $0.4 million received prior to the exercise, resulted in a gain of $1.1 million for the year that was recorded in gains on retained interests in securitizations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our total operating expenses were approximately $6.4 million compared to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During 2018, Orchid's book value and monthly dividend decreased significantly, which caused decreases in management fee revenue and dividend income on Orchid stock. Because of this decrease in cash flows, management has revised its estimated utilization of NOL carryforwards in future periods, resulting in an increase in the deferred tax valuation asset allowance.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted, so accordingly, we recorded an income tax provision of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including a charge of $25.9 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the tax rate reduction.\nFinancial Condition:\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nAs of December 31, 2018, our MBS portfolio consisted of $212.4 million of agency or government MBS at fair value and had a weighted average coupon of 4.25%. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received principal repayments of $23.5 million compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average prepayment speeds for the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 6.6% and 8.8%, respectively.\nThe following table presents the 3-month constant prepayment rate ( CPR\u201d) experienced on our structured and PT MBS sub-portfolios, on an annualized basis, for the quarterly periods presented. CPR is a method of expressing the prepayment rate for a mortgage pool that assumes that a constant fraction of the remaining principal is prepaid each month or year. Specifically, the CPR in the chart below represents the three month prepayment rate of the securities in the respective asset category. Assets that were not owned for the entire quarter have been excluded from the calculation. The exclusion of certain assets during periods of high trading activity can create a very high, and often volatile, reliance on a small sample of underlying loans.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

We generally seek to acquire low duration assets that offer high levels of protection from mortgage prepayments provided they are reasonably priced by the market. Although the duration of an individual asset can change as a result of changes in interest rates, we strive to maintain a hedged PT MBS portfolio with an effective duration of less than 2.0. The stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of PT MBS generally ranges up to 30 years. However, the effect of prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans tends to shorten the resulting cash flows from our investments substantially. Prepayments occur for various reasons, including refinancing of underlying mortgages, loan payoffs in connection with home sales, and borrowers paying more than their scheduled loan payments, which accelerates the amortization of the loans.\nThe duration of our IO and IIO portfolio will vary greatly depending on the structural features of the securities. While prepayment activity will always affect the cash flows associated with the securities, the interest only nature of IO's may cause their durations to become extremely negative when prepayments are high, and less negative when prepayments are low. Prepayments affect the durations of IIO's similarly, but the floating rate nature of the coupon of IIOs (which is inversely related to the level of one month LIBOR) cause their price movements - and model duration - to be affected by changes in both prepayments and one month LIBOR - both current and anticipated levels. As a result, the duration of IIO securities will also vary greatly.\nPrepayments on the loans underlying our MBS can alter the timing of the cash flows received by us. As a result, we gauge the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by measuring their effective duration. While modified duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to movements in interest rates, effective duration captures both the movement in interest rates and the fact that cash flows to a mortgage related security are altered when interest rates move. Accordingly, when the contract interest rate on a mortgage loan is substantially above prevailing interest rates in the market, the effective duration of securities collateralized by such loans can be quite low because of expected prepayments.\nWe face the risk that the market value of our PT MBS assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our structured MBS or liabilities, including our hedging instruments. Accordingly, we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. We generally calculate duration and effective duration using various third party models or obtain these quotes from third parties. However, empirical results and various third-party models may produce different duration numbers for the same securities.\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedge positions as of December 31, 2018, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 bps, rise 100 bps and rise 200 bps, adjusted to reflect the impact of convexity, which is the measure of the sensitivity of our hedge positions and Agency MBS' effective duration to movements in interest rates.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td>

We believe these facilities provide borrowing capacity in excess of our needs. None of these lenders are affiliated with the Company. These borrowings are secured by our MBS and cash.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had obligations outstanding under the repurchase agreements of approximately $200.4 million with a net weighted average borrowing cost of 2.56%. The remaining maturity of our outstanding repurchase agreement obligations ranged from 9 to 50 days, with a weighted average maturity of 31 days. Securing the repurchase agreement obligation as of December 31, 2018 are MBS with an estimated fair value, including accrued interest, of $213.1 million and a weighted average maturity of 322 months, and cash posted as collateral of $230,000. Through March 20, 2019, we have been able to maintain our repurchase facilities with comparable terms to those that existed at December 31, 2018 with maturities through June 7, 2019.\nThe table below presents information about our period-end and average repurchase agreement obligations for each quarter in 2018 and 2017.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ending\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maximum\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Difference Between Ending\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Repurchase Agreements and\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Repurchase Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,396\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,746\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,673\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.83\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 203,742\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 204,988\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 189,582\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,160\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 175,422\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 193,753\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 184,621\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,199\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.98\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 193,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 204,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 197,001\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.61\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 200,183\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 201,291\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 193,778\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 187,374\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 187,505\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 161,003\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,371\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.38\n</td> <td> %(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 134,633\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 134,669\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 126,341\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,292\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,049\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 121,877\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 119,938\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,889\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.57\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The higher ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 reflects the growth of the portfolio. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company's investment in PT MBS increased $56.1 million. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is our ability to turn non-cash assets into cash, purchase additional investments, repay principal and interest on borrowings, fund overhead and fulfill margin calls. Our principal immediate sources of liquidity include cash balances, unencumbered assets, the availability to borrow under repurchase agreements, and fees and dividends received from Orchid. Our borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our interest earning assets varies. Our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on-going basis through payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio. As further described in Note 4 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company exercised its optional early termination rights and received net distributions of approximately $1.4 million. That distribution, along with the cash flow of approximately $0.4 million received prior to the exercise, resulted in a gain of $1.1 million for the year that was recorded in gains on retained interests in securitizations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Historically, the ongoing regular cash flows from these retained interest positions provided the Company with liquidity, however, the predictability of such cash flows diminished during 2018 which contributed to the decision to terminate and collect a one-time final distribution. Future cash flows from the remaining unterminated positions is expected to be negligible. Management believes that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for (a) the acquisition of additional investments consistent with the size and nature of our existing MBS portfolio, (b) the repayments on borrowings, (c) the payment of overhead and operating expenses, and the payment of other accrued obligations.\nOur strategy for hedging our funding costs typically involves taking short positions in Eurodollar futures, T-Note futures, swaptions or other instruments. Since inception we have primarily used short positions in Eurodollar futures. When the market causes these short positions to decline in value we are required to meet margin calls with cash. This can reduce our liquidity position to the extent other securities in our portfolio move in price in such a way that we do not receive enough cash through margin calls to offset the Eurodollar related margin calls. If this were to occur in sufficient magnitude, the loss of liquidity might force us to reduce the size of the levered portfolio, pledge additional structured securities to raise funds or risk operating the portfolio with less liquidity.\nOur master repurchase agreements have no stated expiration, but can be terminated at any time at our option or at the option of the counterparty. However, once a definitive repurchase agreement under a master repurchase agreement has been entered into, it generally may not be terminated by either party. A negotiated termination can occur, but may involve a fee to be paid by the party seeking to terminate the repurchase agreement transaction.\nUnder our repurchase agreement funding arrangements, we are required to post margin at the initiation of the borrowing. The margin posted represents the haircut, which is a percentage of the market value of the collateral pledged. To the extent the market value of the asset collateralizing the financing transaction declines, the market value of our posted margin will be insufficient and we will be required to post additional collateral. Conversely, if the market value of the asset pledged increases in value, we would be over collateralized and we would be entitled to have excess margin returned to us by the counterparty. Our lenders typically value our pledged securities daily to ensure the adequacy of our margin and make margin calls as needed, as do we. Typically, but not always, the parties agree to a minimum threshold amount for margin calls so as to avoid the need for nuisance margin calls on a daily basis. Our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis.\nAs discussed above, we invest a portion of our capital in structured MBS. We generally do not apply leverage to this portion of our portfolio. The leverage inherent in structured securities replaces the leverage obtained by acquiring PT securities and funding them in the repurchase market. This structured MBS strategy has been a core element of the Company's overall investment strategy since 2008. However, we have and may continue to pledge a portion of our structured MBS in order to raise our cash levels, but generally will not pledge these securities in order to acquire additional assets.\nIn future periods we expect to continue to finance our activities through repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 million. We generated cash flows of $31.8 million from principal and interest payments on our MBS portfolio and had average repurchase agreements outstanding of $193.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $7.8 million in management fees and expense reimbursements as manager of Orchid and approximately $1.6 million in dividends from our investment in Orchid common stock. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $1.4 million in connection with the termination of certain securitizations associated with our retained interests. We do not expect to generate cash in similar transactions in future periods.\nThe table below summarizes the effect that certain future contractual obligations existing as of December 31, 2018 will have on our liquidity and cash flows.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Obligations Maturing\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Within\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to Three\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to Five\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than Five\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,396\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,396\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on repurchase agreements(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,031\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,031\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on junior subordinated notes(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,726\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,320\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,194\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203,403\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,320\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 255,871\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Interest expense on repurchase agreements and junior subordinated notes are based on current interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and the remaining term of liabilities existing at that date. \n (2) The Company holds a common equity interest in Bimini Capital Trust II. The amount presented represents the net cash outlay of the Company. \nOutlook\nOrchid Island Capital Inc.\nTo the extent Orchid is able to increase its capital base over time, we will benefit via increased management fees. In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for direct expenses paid on its behalf and to pay to us Orchid's pro rata share of overhead as defined in the management agreement. As a stockholder of Orchid, we will also continue to share in distributions, if any, paid by Orchid to its stockholders. Our operating results are also impacted by changes in the market value of our holdings of Orchid common shares, although these market value changes do not impact our cash flows from Orchid.\nThe independent Board of Directors of Orchid has the ability to terminate the management agreement and thus end our ability to collect management fees and share overhead costs. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will pay us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the current automatic renewal term.\nInterest Rates and the MBS Market\nThe fourth quarter of 2018 was pivotal. The trajectory of the growth rate of the U.S. economy, the level of interest rates, and expectations for monetary policy on the part of the Federal Reserve (the Fed\u201d) changed dramatically during the quarter. In early October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the Dow\u201d) hit an all-time high level, West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) crude hit a multi-year high, the unemployment rate dropped to a 49-year low and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a multi-year high yield. The Fed appeared fully committed to extending its rate hike regime as Chairman Powell stated the Fed was a long way from neutral at this point,\u201d and that we may go past neutral.\u201d The market fully expected the Fed to continue its gradual rate hikes into 2019 at that point, although market pricing reflected two additional rate hikes in 2019 versus the three reflected in the Fed's Dot Plots.\u201d Over the course of the quarter, the outlook changed dramatically.\nOver the first two months of the fourth quarter conditions that had previously been supportive of this outlook changed. Growth rates in a few countries in Europe were slightly negative in Q3 of 2018. Industrial production, the primary engine of growth for key export-oriented countries in the European Union, turned negative on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Growth in China slowed over the course of the year as each successive quarter was lower than the last, finally hitting 6.4% for the fourth quarter of 2018. China's growth rate for the entire year was the lowest in 28 years. Earnings reports released by many large US corporations for the third quarter, released in October and November, contained generally down-beat forward guidance. Management teams frequently referenced both the effects of tariffs imposed on imports during 2018 and slowing growth in Europe, China and the balance of global markets. Domestic economic data - outside of labor market related data - softened, especially the ISM data released in early December (for the month of November), which showed one of the sharpest declines in many years. The final development that shook the markets was the partial government shutdown, which lasted a record 5 weeks. As the year came to a close all risk markets performed very badly. The equity markets in the US, as measured by the broad indices - the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq - erased essentially all of their year-to-date gains and entered bear-market territory. Commodity prices declined, with WTI crude oil decreasing by over 43% (peak to trough) during the quarter. Liquidity in risk markets - typically low over the course of the last two weeks of the year due to holiday absences - was acutely poor in late 2018. Funding levels over the turn of the year were abnormally high - and in extreme instances more than double levels seen earlier in the year. The yield on the 10-year US treasury note rallied by over 68 bps - peak to trough - during the quarter. By the end of the year market pricing - as reflected in Fed funds futures - was for a cut in rates from the current level at some point over 2019 and 2020.\nThe Fed took notice of the material change in market sentiment that occurred over the course of the quarter. The Fed did raise rates at its December meeting - the ninth increase for the current cycle which began in December of 2015. However, the tone of the Fed, as reflected in both its press release issued at the conclusion of the meeting and during Chairman Powell's press conference - seemed to have changed. The Chairman stated that the Fed now saw the current level of the overnight Fed funds rate as being at the bottom end of the range of what it considered neutral. The Chairman acknowledged the FOMC's awareness of ongoing market events. Finally, at its January 2019 meeting, the Fed stated its policy rate is now in the range of the FOMC's estimate of neutral. More importantly, the FOMC now viewed itself as data dependent and that market conditions would determine its next move, whether that be a rate hike or cut. This represented a dramatic shift in the Fed policy outlook and was perceived as quite dovish by the markets. Risk markets quickly rallied and have continued to do so in early 2019.\nAs we enter 2019, the outlook is far different than it was at the end of the third quarter. The risks to the economic outlook - at least in the eyes of the market - are now clearly to the downside. Risks include a potential hard Brexit\u201d for the United Kingdom from the European Union, very weak growth in Europe and China, the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, and the prospect that all of these factors will cause growth in the U.S. to slow materially. The market now sees at most one more Fed rate hike in 2019 and likely cuts by the end of 2020.\nThe Agency MBS market reacted to market developments during the fourth quarter of 2018 negatively before the market turmoil became severe during the last five weeks of the quarter. The current coupon, 30-year fixed rate Agency MBS traded at a spread of approximately 0.74% to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note on October 3, 2018, but then widened to spread just above 0.90% on November 23, 2018. As the market turmoil intensified and interest rates began a sharp rally in late November, the current coupon Agency MBS performed well and ended the quarter at a spread to the same U.S. Treasury benchmark of approximately 0.82% and eventually reached 0.75% by the end of January 2019. For the quarter, the Bloomberg Agency MBS index returned 2.08%, and 0.99% for the full year of 2018. However, the performance was very uneven among the various coupons and maturities of the index. Lower coupon securities performed much better than higher coupon securities owing to the worse convexity and increased prepayment expectations of higher coupon securities. As was the case at the end of the third quarter of 2018, recent production of Agency MBS has frequently had characteristics that negatively impact the anticipated total returns of the securities. In this case the spread between the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgage loans and the net rate received by the investor is quite high. This leads to higher prepayment activity for the given coupon versus more typical spreads. Also, average loan balances appear higher than what market participants are accustomed to and average FICO scores are higher as well. All three of these factors tend to increase prepayment expectations and negatively impact expected returns for the securities. This concern was heightened as the Mortgage Bankers Association's refi index, after declining during the fourth quarter from approximately 950 at the beginning of the quarter to below 750 at the end of the quarter, increased dramatically to near 1180 during January 2019. Going forward, with prevailing mortgage rates available to borrowers now below 4.5%, versus 4.94% for the week of November 8, 2018, combined with the fact seasonal refinancing activity is due to increase in the coming months, we believe that the prepayment characteristics of various securities will be the driver of relative performance.\nRecent Regulatory Developments\nIn September 2017, the FOMC announced that it would implement a balance sheet normalization policy by gradually decreasing the Fed's reinvestment of U.S. Treasuries and Agency MBS. More specifically, principal payments received by the Fed will be reinvested only to the extent they exceed gradually rising caps until the FOMC determines that the Fed is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. In October 2017, the FOMC commenced this balance sheet normalization program. In October 2018, the Fed reached its terminal cap of $20 billion per month. Going forward, the Fed will only purchase Agency MBS to the extent paydowns on the Fed's holdings exceed $20 billion in any given month. These steps have been referred to as the Fed's balance sheet normalization.\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made statements following the January 2019 meeting that the Fed is evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of the balance sheet normalization and will finalize its plan to do so at a later meeting. In its January 30, 2019 release, the Fed said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\nIn 2017, policymakers announced that LIBOR will be replaced by 2021. The directive was spurred by the fact that banks are uncomfortable contributing to the LIBOR panel given the shortage of underlying transactions on which to base levels and the liability associated with submitting an unfounded level. LIBOR will be replaced with a new SOFR, a rate based on U.S. repo trading. The new benchmark rate will be based on overnight Treasury General Collateral repo rates. The rate-setting process will be managed and published by the Fed and the Treasury's Office of Financial Research. Many banks believe that it may take four to five years to complete the transition to SOFR, despite the 2021 deadline. We will monitor the emergence of this new rate carefully as it will likely become the new benchmark for hedges and a range of interest rate investments.\nIn January 2019, the Trump administration made statements of its plans to work with Congress to overhaul Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and expectations to announce a framework for the development of a policy for comprehensive housing finance reform soon. At this time, however, no decisions have been made on any reform plan.\nThe scope and nature of the actions the U.S. government or the Fed will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve. Although the Trump administration has made statements of its intentions to reform housing finance and tax policy, many of these potential policy changes will require congressional action. In addition, the Fed has made statements regarding additional increases to the Federal Funds Rate in 2019 and beyond.\nEffect on Us\nRegulatory developments, movements in interest rates and prepayment rates affect us in many ways, including the following:\nEffects on our Assets\nA change in or elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may increase our costs (if, for example, guarantee fees increase) or require us to change our investment strategy altogether. For example, the elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may cause us to change our investment strategy to focus on non-Agency MBS, which in turn would require us to significantly increase our monitoring of the credit risks of our investments in addition to interest rate and prepayment risks.\nLower long-term interest rates can affect the value of our Agency MBS in a number of ways. If prepayment rates are relatively low (due, in part, to the refinancing problems described above), lower long-term interest rates can increase the value of higher-coupon Agency MBS. This is because investors typically place a premium on assets with yields that are higher than market yields. Although lower long-term interest rates may increase asset values in our portfolio, we may not be able to invest new funds in similarly-yielding assets.\nIf prepayment levels increase, the value of our Agency MBS affected by such prepayments may decline. This is because a principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency MBS, which would shorten the period during which an investor would receive above-market returns (assuming the yield on the prepaid asset is higher than market yields). Also, prepayment proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in similar-yielding assets. Agency MBS backed by mortgages with high interest rates are more susceptible to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are most likely to refinance to a lower rate. IOs and IIOs, however, may be the types of Agency MBS most sensitive to increased prepayment rates. Because the holder of an IO or IIO receives no principal payments, the values of IOs and IIOs are entirely dependent on the existence of a principal balance on the underlying mortgages. If the principal balance is eliminated due to prepayment, IOs and IIOs essentially become worthless. Although increased prepayment rates can negatively affect the value of our IOs and IIOs, they have the opposite effect on POs. Because POs act like zero-coupon bonds, meaning they are purchased at a discount to their par value and have an effective interest rate based on the discount and the term of the underlying loan, an increase in prepayment rates would reduce the effective term of our POs and accelerate the yields earned on those assets, which would increase our net income.\nHigher long-term rates can also affect the value of our Agency MBS. As long-term rates rise, rates available to borrowers also rise. This tends to cause prepayment activity to slow and extend the expected average life of mortgage cash flows. As the expected average life of the mortgage cash flows increases, coupled with higher discount rates, the value of Agency MBS declines. Some of the instruments the Company uses to hedge our Agency MBS assets, such as Euro Dollar futures, swaps, interest rate futures and swaptions, are stable average life instruments. This means that to the extent we use such instruments to hedge our Agency MBS assets, our hedges may not adequately protect us from price declines, and therefore may negatively impact our book value. It is for this reason we use interest only securities in our portfolio. As interest rates rise, the expected average life of these securities increases, causing generally positive price movements as the number and size of the cash flows increase the longer the underlying mortgages remain outstanding. This makes interest only securities desirable hedge instruments for pass-through Agency MBS.\nAs the economy has rebounded from the financial crisis, the Fed has taken steps to remove the considerable accommodation that was employed to combat the crisis. At the conclusion of its meeting in September 2017, the Fed announced it would implement caps on the amount of Agency MBS assets it would allow to run off, or not be re-invested, starting in October 2017. Previously the Fed would re-invest all of the principal repayments it received each month on the Agency MBS assets it had acquired during its quantitative easing programs. By capping the amount they would allow to run off each month, the Fed was effectively limiting the amount it would re-invest. Pursuant to the Fed's September 2017 announcement, the cap reached $20 billion per month in October 2018. At the time of the Fed's announcement in September 2017, its monthly re-investments were approximately $20 billion per month as well, so this implied the Fed would stop, or nearly stop, re-investing its monthly pay-downs beyond October 2018. The purchases each month by the Fed have been a significant source of demand in the Agency MBS market and as it is reduced slowly over the course of 2018 and essentially eliminated beyond October 2018, the removal of this source of demand could negatively impact Agency MBS prices. The extent this negatively impacts the Agency MBS market will be a function of the level of supply each month - as the supply/demand balance affects the price of any asset - and whether or not another source of demand emerges to replace the Fed. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made statements following the January 2019 meeting that the Fed is evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of the balance sheet normalization and will finalize its plan to do so at a later meeting. In its January 30, 2019 release, the Fed said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\u2003\nBecause we base our investment decisions on risk management principles rather than anticipated movements in interest rates, in a volatile interest rate environment we may allocate more capital to structured Agency MBS with shorter durations, such as short-term fixed and floating rate CMOs. We believe these securities have a lower sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates than other asset classes. We may attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates by investing in IOs and IIOs, which typically have different sensitivities to changes in long-term interest rates than PT MBS, particularly PT MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages.\nEffects on our borrowing costs\nWe leverage our PT MBS portfolio and a portion of our structured Agency MBS with principal balances through the use of short-term repurchase agreement transactions. The interest rates on our debt are determined by market levels of both the Federal Funds Rate and LIBOR. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR would increase our borrowing costs, which could affect our interest rate spread if there is no corresponding increase in the interest we earn on our assets. This would be most prevalent with respect to our Agency MBS backed by fixed rate mortgage loans because the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage loan does not change even though market rates may change.\nIn order to protect our net interest margin against increases in short-term interest rates, we may enter into interest rate swaps, which economically convert our floating-rate repurchase agreement debt to fixed-rate debt, or utilize other hedging instruments such as Eurodollar and T-Note futures contracts or interest rate swaptions.\nSummary\nThe U.S. economy appears to have fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008. Growth has accelerated, reaching 4% annualized in the second quarter of 2018 and 3.4% in the third quarter. The economic data has in many cases reached multi-year or, in some cases, multi-decade levels. The economy appeared to have considerable momentum as it entered the fourth quarter. The Fed raised rates for the ninth time at its December meeting and, up until then, seemed intent on continuing to do so into 2020. This trajectory abruptly changed during the fourth quarter due to a combination of factors. Growth in Europe and China slowed significantly throughout 2018 and hit a recent trough late in the year. Great Britain is faced with the potential for a hard Brexit\u201d from the European Union, the federal government had a five week partial shutdown around the turn of the year and domestic economic data, at least non-labor market related data, has softened. Financial markets in the U.S. and globally experienced significant turmoil during the fourth quarter with returns for the year generally erased entirely. Interest rates, after hitting multi-year highs early in the quarter, declined by over 60 bps in the case of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. The policy stance of the Fed has changed to a balanced outlook, with data dependency the driver of further rate decisions - whether up or down.\nThe Bloomberg Agency MBS index generated a return of 2.08% for the quarter, although this return number masks the fact the performance of the sector was very uneven, both in time and across the various securities that make up the index. The Agency MBS market performed poorly though the end of November, as the spread of the 30-year, current coupon Agency MBS widened in spread to the 10-year U.S. treasury note by over 0.15%. However, as the market turmoil became more severe and rates rallied close to 2.50% in the case of the 10-year note - versus above 3.20% at the beginning of the quarter - Agency MBS did very well (as an index). However, with the decline in rates prepayment fears and convexity concerns intensified, resulting in very uneven performance for the index. Longer duration, lower coupon securities performed very well, while higher coupon, shorter duration securities performed quite badly. Given the new rate environment and lack of concern surrounding future rate hikes, we believe that the mortgage market will be driven by prepayment characteristics going forward.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires our management to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments which could significantly affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management has identified its most critical accounting estimates:\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nOur investments in MBS are accounted for under the fair value option. We acquire our MBS for the purpose of generating long-term returns, and not for the short-term investment of idle capital. Changes in the fair value of securities accounted for under the fair value option are reflected as part of our net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations, as opposed to a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of stockholder's equity if they were instead reclassified as available-for-sale securities. We elected to account for all of our MBS under the fair value option in order to reflect changes in the fair value of our MBS in our consolidated statement of operations, which we believe more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period. GAAP requires the use of a three-level valuation hierarchy to disclose the classification of fair value measurements used for determining the fair value of our MBS. These levels include:\n \u00b7 Level 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume), \n \u00b7 Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market, and \n \u00b7 Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company- specific data. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. \nOur MBS are valued using Level 2 valuations, and such valuations currently are determined based on independent pricing sources and/or third party broker quotes when available. Because the price estimates may vary, management must make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use to calculate the fair values. Alternatively, the Company could opt to have the value of all of our positions in MBS determined by either an independent third-party or do so internally. In managing our portfolio, the Company employs the following four-step process at each valuation date to determine the fair value of our MBS.\n \u00b7 First, the Company obtains fair values from subscription-based independent pricing services. \n \u00b7 Second, the Company requests non-binding quotes from one to four broker-dealers for certain MBS in order to validate the values obtained by the pricing service. The Company requests these quotes from broker-dealers that actively trade and make markets in the respective asset class for which the quote is requested. \n \u00b7 Third, the Company reviews the values obtained by the pricing source and the broker-dealers for consistency across similar assets. \n \u00b7 Finally, if the data from the pricing services and broker-dealers is not homogenous or if the data obtained is inconsistent with management's market observations, the Company makes a judgment to determine which price appears the most consistent with observed prices from similar assets and selects that price. To the extent management believes that none of the prices are consistent with observed prices for similar assets, which is typically the case for only an immaterial portion of our portfolio each quarter, the Company may use a third price that is consistent with observed prices for identical or similar assets. In the case of assets that have quoted prices such as Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages, the Company generally uses the quoted or observed market price. For assets such as Agency MBS backed by ARMs or structured Agency MBS, the Company may determine the price based on the yield or spread that is identical to an observed transaction or a similar asset for which a dealer mark or subscription-based price has been obtained. \nManagement believes its pricing methodology to be consistent with the definition of fair value described in FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nInvestment in Orchid Island Capital, Inc. Common Stock\nThe Company has elected the fair value option for its investment in Orchid common shares. The change in the fair value of this investment and dividends received on this investment are reflected in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the fair value of our investment in Orchid on a market approach using Level 1\u201d inputs based on the quoted market price of Orchid's common stock on the NYSE. Electing the fair value option requires the Company to record changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations, which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period and is consistent with how the investment is managed.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nRetained interests in the subordinated tranches of securities created in securitization transactions were initially recorded at their fair value when issued by Royal Palm. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are reflected in earnings. Quoted market prices for these assets are generally not available, so the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management's best estimates of key assumptions, which include expected credit losses, prepayment speeds, weighted-average life, and discount rates commensurate with the inherent risks of the asset.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate asset/liability strategies and manage other exposures, and we may continue to do so in the future. The principal instruments that we have used to date are T-Note and Eurodollar futures contracts and interest rate swaptions, but we may enter into other derivatives in the future.\nWe have elected not to treat any of our derivative financial instruments as hedges in order to align the accounting treatment of our derivative instruments with the treatment of our portfolio assets under the fair value option election. FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging, requires that all derivative instruments be carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in earnings for each period.\nIncome Recognition\nAll of our MBS are either PT MBS or structured MBS, including CMOs, IOs, IIOs or POs. Income on PT MBS, POs and CMOs that contain principal balances is based on the stated interest rate of the security. As a result of accounting for our MBS under the fair value option, premium or discount present at the date of purchase is not amortized. For IOs, IIOs and CMOs that do not contain principal balances, income is accrued based on the carrying value and the effective yield. As cash is received it is first applied to accrued interest and then to reduce the carrying value of the security. At each reporting date, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively from the reporting period based on the new estimate of prepayments, current interest rates and current asset prices. The new effective yield is calculated based on the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, the new prepayment estimates and the contractual terms of the security. Changes in fair value of all of our MBS during the period are recorded in earnings and reported as unrealized gains or losses on mortgage-backed securities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For IIO securities, effective yield and income recognition calculations also take into account the index value applicable to the security.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The measurement of net deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance if, based on the Company's evaluation, it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. A majority of the Company's net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by the revenue forecasts of management fees, Orchid dividends and net interest income, and the subsequent reinvestment of those amounts into the MBS portfolio over the extended period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could lead management to reassess its valuation allowance conclusions.\nThe Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for years ended on or after December 31, 2015 remain open for examination. Although management believes its calculations for tax returns are correct and the positions taken thereon are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits could be materially different from the tax returns filed by the Company, and those differences could result in significant costs or benefits to the Company.\nThe Company measures, recognizes and presents its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under that guidance, the Company assesses the likelihood, based on their technical merit, that tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the facts, circumstances and information available at the end of each period. The measurement of uncertain tax positions is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that requires a change. The Company recognizes tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit and is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within the income tax provision.\nCapital Expenditures\nAt December 31, 2018, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nBimini Capital Management, Inc. (\"Bimini Capital\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company that was formed in September 2003. The Company's principal operating subsidiaries are Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and Royal Palm Capital, LLC. We operate in two business segments: the asset management segment, which includes the investment advisory services provided by Bimini Advisors to Orchid, and the investment portfolio segment, which includes the investment activities conducted by Bimini Capital and Royal Palm.\nBimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (a registered investment advisor), are collectively referred to as Bimini Advisors.\u201d Bimini Advisors serves as the external manager of the portfolio of Orchid Island Capital, Inc. (\"Orchid\"). From this arrangement, the Company receives management fees and expense reimbursements. As manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid's business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors provides Orchid with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of Orchid's board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to it. In addition, the Company receives dividends from its investment in Orchid common shares.\nRoyal Palm Capital, LLC (collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries referred to as Royal Palm\u201d) maintains an investment portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") issued and guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or agency (\"Agency MBS\"). Our investment strategy focuses on, and our portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency MBS (\"PT MBS\") and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"), interest only securities (\"IOs\"), inverse interest only securities (\"IIOs\") and principal only securities (\"POs\"), among other types of structured Agency MBS.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nOn March 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of Bimini Capital Management, Inc. (the Company\u201d) approved a Stock Repurchase Plan ( Repurchase Plan\u201d). Pursuant to Repurchase Plan, the Company may purchase up to 500,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock from time to time, subject to certain limitations imposed by Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. The Repurchase Plan was originally set to expire on November 15, 2018, but was extended by the Board of Directors until November 15, 2019. The authorization for the Share Repurchase Plan may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company's Board of Directors in its discretion at any time.\nThrough December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 69,690 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $165,000, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of $2.37 per share. Subsequent to that date, and through March 20, 2019, the Company has repurchased 714 shares for a net cost of approximately $1,500 and a weighted average price of $2.16 per share.\nFactors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nA variety of industry and economic factors may impact our results of operations and financial condition. These factors include:\n \u00b7 interest rate trends; \n \u00b7 the difference between Agency MBS yields and our funding and hedging costs; \n \u00b7 competition for investments in Agency MBS; \n \u00b7 actions taken by the U.S. government, including the presidential administration, the Federal Reserve (the Fed\u201d), the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC\u201d) and the U.S. Treasury; \n \u00b7 prepayment rates on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS, and credit trends insofar as they affect prepayment rates; \n \u00b7 the equity markets and the ability of Orchid to raise additional capital; and \n \u00b7 other market developments. \nIn addition, a variety of factors relating to our business may also impact our results of operations and financial condition. These factors include:\n \u00b7 our degree of leverage; \n \u00b7 our access to funding and borrowing capacity; \n \u00b7 our borrowing costs; \n \u00b7 our hedging activities; \n \u00b7 the market value of our investments; \n \u00b7 the requirements to qualify for a registration exemption under the Investment Company Act; \n \u00b7 our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income; \n \u00b7 the impact of possible future changes in tax laws; and \n \u00b7 our ability to manage the portfolio of Orchid and maintain our role as manager. \nResults of Operations\nDescribed below are the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Loss Summary\nConsolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $26.8 million, or $2.10 basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Common Stock, as compared to consolidated net loss of $16.5 million, or $1.30 basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Common Stock, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe components of net loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, along with the changes in those components are presented in the table below:\n\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nEconomic Interest Expense and Economic Net Interest Income\nWe use derivative instruments, specifically Eurodollar and Treasury Note ( T-Note\u201d) futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk on our repurchase agreements and junior subordinate notes in a rising rate environment.\nWe have not elected to designate our derivative holdings for hedge accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in fair value of these instruments are presented in a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations and not included in interest expense. As such, for financial reporting purposes, interest expense and cost of funds are not impacted by the fluctuation in value of the derivative instruments.\nFor the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures, GAAP interest expense has been adjusted to reflect the realized and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative instruments the Company uses that pertain to each period presented. We believe that adjusting our interest expense for the periods presented by the gains or losses on these derivative instruments would not accurately reflect our economic interest expense for these periods. The reason is that these derivative instruments may cover periods that extend into the future, not just the current period. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses on the instruments reflect the change in market value of the instrument caused by changes in underlying interest rates applicable to the term covered by the instrument, not just the current period.\nFor each period presented, we have combined the effects of the derivative financial instruments in place for the respective period with the actual interest expense incurred on our borrowings to reflect total economic interest expense for the applicable period. Interest expense, including the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic interest expense. Net interest income, when calculated to include the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic net interest income.\n\u2003\nWe believe that economic interest expense and economic net interest income provide meaningful information to consider, in addition to the respective amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures help management to evaluate our financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio or operations. The gains or losses on derivative instruments presented in our consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily representative of the total interest rate expense that we will ultimately realize. This is because as interest rates move up or down in the future, the gains or losses we ultimately realize, and which will affect our total interest rate expense in future periods, may differ from the unrealized gains or losses recognized as of the reporting date.\nOur presentation of the economic value of our hedging strategy has important limitations. First, other market participants may calculate economic interest expense and economic net interest income differently than the way we calculate them. Second, while the we believe that the calculation of the economic value of our hedging strategy described above helps to present our financial position and performance, it may be of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, the economic value of our investment strategy should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for interest expense and net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables below present a reconciliation of the adjustments to interest expense shown for each period relative to our derivative instruments, and the consolidated statements of operations line item, gains (losses) on derivative instruments, calculated in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each quarter during 2018 and 2017.\n\n\n\n (1) Reflects the effect of derivative instrument hedges for only the period presented. \n (2) Calculated by subtracting the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period presented from GAAP interest expense. \n (3) Calculated by adding the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period presented to GAAP net portfolio interest income. \n\n (1) Calculated by adding the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period presented to GAAP net portfolio interest income. \n (2) Reflects the effect of derivative instrument hedges for only the period presented. \n (3) Calculated by subtracting the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period presented from GAAP interest expense. \n (4) Calculated by adding the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period presented to GAAP net interest income. \nSegment Information\nWe have two operating segments. The asset management segment includes the investment advisory services provided by Bimini Advisors to Orchid and Royal Palm. The investment portfolio segment includes the investment activities conducted by Royal Palm. Segment information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\n\n (1) Includes advisory services revenue received by Bimini Advisors from Royal Palm. \n (2) Includes interest on junior subordinated note. \n (3) Includes gains (losses) on Eurodollar futures contracts entered into as a hedge on junior subordinated notes and fair value adjustments on retained interests in securitizations. \n (4) Corporate expenses are allocated based on each segment's proportional share of total revenues. \nAsset Management Segment\nAdvisory Services Revenue\nAdvisory services revenue consist of management fees and overhead reimbursements charged to Orchid for the management of its portfolio pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. We receive a monthly management fee in the amount of:\n \u00b7 One-twelfth of 1.5% of the first $250 million of the Orchid's equity, as defined in the management agreement, \n \u00b7 One-twelfth of 1.25% of the Orchid's equity that is greater than $250 million and less than or equal to $500 million, and \n \u00b7 One-twelfth of 1.00% of the Orchid's equity that is greater than $500 million. \nIn addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for any direct expenses incurred on its behalf and to pay to us an amount equal to Orchid's pro rata portion of certain overhead costs set forth in the management agreement. The management agreement has been renewed through February 2020 and provides for automatic one-year extension options. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will pay to us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the automatic renewal term.\nThe following table summarizes the advisory services revenue received from Orchid for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and each quarter during 2018 and 2017.\n\nInvestment Portfolio Segment\nNet Portfolio Interest Income\nWe define net portfolio interest income as interest income on MBS less interest expense on repurchase agreement funding. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $4.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $8.4 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $4.0 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $4.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $6.1 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $1.8 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. The $2.3 million increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a 31 basis point (\"bp\") increase in yields earned on the portfolio, combined with a $44.1 million increase in average MBS balances. The $2.2 million increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a combination of a $43.1 million increase in average repurchase liabilities and, more significantly, an 88 bp increase in cost of funds.\nOur economic interest expense on repurchase liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $4.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, resulting in $4.2 million and $3.7 million of economic net portfolio interest income, respectively.\nThe tables below provide information on our portfolio average balances, interest income, yield on assets, average repurchase agreement balances, interest expense, cost of funds, net interest income and net interest rate spread for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on both a GAAP and economic basis.\n\n\n (1) Portfolio yields and costs of borrowings presented in the tables above and the tables on pages 43 and 44 are calculated based on the average balances of the underlying investment portfolio/repurchase agreement balances and are annualized for the periods presented \n (2) Economic interest expense and economic net interest income presented in the tables above and the tables on page 44 include the effect of derivative instrument hedges for only the period presented. \n (3) Represents interest cost of our borrowings and the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period related to hedging activities divided by average MBS held. \n (4) Economic net interest spread is calculated by subtracting average economic cost of funds from yield on average MBS. \nInterest Income and Average Earning Asset Yield\nOur interest income was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $6.1 million for year ended December 31, 2017. Average MBS holdings were $203.2 million and $159.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $2.3 million increase in interest income was due to a 31 bp increase in yields, combined with a $44.1 million increase in average MBS holdings. Interest rates were generally higher in 2018 than in 2017. This pertains not only to yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, but also on Agency MBS as well.\nThe table below presents the average portfolio size, income and yields of our respective sub-portfolios, consisting of structured MBS and pass-through MBS ( PT MBS\u201d).\n\nInterest Expense on Repurchase Agreements and the Cost of Funds\nOur average outstanding repurchase agreements were $193.3 million and $150.3 million, generating interest expense of $4.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our average cost of funds was 2.08% and 1.20% for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was an 88 bp increase in the average cost of funds and a $43.1 million increase in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur economic interest expense was $4.2 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was a 58 bp increase in the average economic cost of funds to 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 1.59% for the previous year. The $1.8 million increase in economic interest expense was due to the $43.1 million increase in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the favorable performance of our derivative agreements attributed to the current period.\nSince all of our repurchase agreements are short-term, changes in market rates directly affect our interest expense. Our average cost of funds calculated on a GAAP basis was 5 bps above average one-month LIBOR and 30 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Our average economic cost of funds was 21 bps below average one-month LIBOR and 56 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The average term to maturity of the outstanding repurchase agreements decreased from 38 days at December 31, 2017 to 31 days at December 31, 2018.\nThe tables below present the average outstanding balance under all repurchase agreements, interest expense and average economic cost of funds, and average one-month and six-month LIBOR rates for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 on both a GAAP and economic basis.\n\n\nDividend Income\nAt both December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned 1,520,036 shares of Orchid common stock. Orchid paid total dividends of $1.07 per share during 2018 and $1.68 per share during 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we received dividends on this common stock investment of approximately $1.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nJunior Subordinated Notes\nInterest expense on our junior subordinated debt securities was approximately $1.5 million and $1.2 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average rate of interest paid for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 5.65% compared to 4.69% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The junior subordinated debt securities pay interest at a floating rate. The rate is adjusted quarterly and set at a spread of 3.50% over the prevailing three-month LIBOR rate on the determination date. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rate was 6.29%.\nGains or Losses and Other Income\nThe table below presents our gains or losses and other income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nWe invest in MBS with the intent to earn net income from the realized yield on those assets over their related funding and hedging costs, and not for the purpose of making short term gains from trading in these securities. However, we have sold, and may continue to sell, existing assets to acquire new assets, which our management believes might have higher risk-adjusted returns in light of current or anticipated interest rates, federal government programs or general economic conditions or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset/liability management strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds of $60.4 million from the sales of MBS compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe fair value of our MBS portfolio and derivative instruments, and the gains (losses) reported on those financial instruments, are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table below presents historical interest rate data as of each quarter end during 2018 and 2017.\n\n (1) Historical 5 Year and 10 Year Treasury Rates are obtained from quoted end of day prices on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. \n (2) Historical 30 Year and 15 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Rates are obtained from Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey. \n (3) Historical LIBOR are obtained from the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. \nThe retained interests in securitizations represent the residual net interest spread remaining after payments on the notes issued through the securitization. Fluctuations in value of retained interests are primarily driven by projections of future interest rates (the forward LIBOR curve), the discount rate used to determine the present value of the residual cash flows and prepayment and loss estimates on the underlying mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded gains on retained interests of $1.1 million compared to gains of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company exercised its optional early termination rights and received net distributions of approximately $1.4 million. That distribution, along with the cash flow of approximately $0.4 million received prior to the exercise, resulted in a gain of $1.1 million for the year that was recorded in gains on retained interests in securitizations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our total operating expenses were approximately $6.4 million compared to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The table below presents a breakdown of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nIn 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $21.1 million, including a $22.5 million increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of management's reassessment, as of December 31, 2018, of the Company's ability to realize tax net operating losses to offset future taxable income. During 2018, Orchid's book value and monthly dividend decreased significantly, which caused decreases in management fee revenue and dividend income on Orchid stock. Because of this decrease in cash flows, management has revised its estimated utilization of NOL carryforwards in future periods, resulting in an increase in the deferred tax valuation asset allowance.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted, so accordingly, we recorded an income tax provision of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including a charge of $25.9 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the tax rate reduction.\nFinancial Condition:\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nAs of December 31, 2018, our MBS portfolio consisted of $212.4 million of agency or government MBS at fair value and had a weighted average coupon of 4.25%. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received principal repayments of $23.5 million compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average prepayment speeds for the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 6.6% and 8.8%, respectively.\nThe following table presents the 3-month constant prepayment rate ( CPR\u201d) experienced on our structured and PT MBS sub-portfolios, on an annualized basis, for the quarterly periods presented. CPR is a method of expressing the prepayment rate for a mortgage pool that assumes that a constant fraction of the remaining principal is prepaid each month or year. Specifically, the CPR in the chart below represents the three month prepayment rate of the securities in the respective asset category. Assets that were not owned for the entire quarter have been excluded from the calculation. The exclusion of certain assets during periods of high trading activity can create a very high, and often volatile, reliance on a small sample of underlying loans.\n\nThe following tables summarize certain characteristics of our PT MBS and structured MBS as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n\n\n (1) Effective duration is the approximate percentage change in price for a 100 bp change in rates. An effective duration of 3.935 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 3.935% decrease in the value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2018. An effective duration of 3.832 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 3.832% decrease in the value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2017. These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio but do include the effect of our funding cost hedges. Effective duration quotes for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc. \nThe following table presents a summary of our portfolio assets acquired during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nOur portfolio of PT MBS is typically comprised of adjustable-rate MBS, fixed-rate MBS and hybrid adjustable-rate MBS. We generally seek to acquire low duration assets that offer high levels of protection from mortgage prepayments provided they are reasonably priced by the market. Although the duration of an individual asset can change as a result of changes in interest rates, we strive to maintain a hedged PT MBS portfolio with an effective duration of less than 2.0. The stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of PT MBS generally ranges up to 30 years. However, the effect of prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans tends to shorten the resulting cash flows from our investments substantially. Prepayments occur for various reasons, including refinancing of underlying mortgages, loan payoffs in connection with home sales, and borrowers paying more than their scheduled loan payments, which accelerates the amortization of the loans.\nThe duration of our IO and IIO portfolio will vary greatly depending on the structural features of the securities. While prepayment activity will always affect the cash flows associated with the securities, the interest only nature of IO's may cause their durations to become extremely negative when prepayments are high, and less negative when prepayments are low. Prepayments affect the durations of IIO's similarly, but the floating rate nature of the coupon of IIOs (which is inversely related to the level of one month LIBOR) cause their price movements - and model duration - to be affected by changes in both prepayments and one month LIBOR - both current and anticipated levels. As a result, the duration of IIO securities will also vary greatly.\nPrepayments on the loans underlying our MBS can alter the timing of the cash flows received by us. As a result, we gauge the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by measuring their effective duration. While modified duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to movements in interest rates, effective duration captures both the movement in interest rates and the fact that cash flows to a mortgage related security are altered when interest rates move. Accordingly, when the contract interest rate on a mortgage loan is substantially above prevailing interest rates in the market, the effective duration of securities collateralized by such loans can be quite low because of expected prepayments.\nWe face the risk that the market value of our PT MBS assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our structured MBS or liabilities, including our hedging instruments. Accordingly, we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. We generally calculate duration and effective duration using various third party models or obtain these quotes from third parties. However, empirical results and various third-party models may produce different duration numbers for the same securities.\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedge positions as of December 31, 2018, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 bps, rise 100 bps and rise 200 bps, adjusted to reflect the impact of convexity, which is the measure of the sensitivity of our hedge positions and Agency MBS' effective duration to movements in interest rates.\n\n\n (1) Represents the average contract/notional amount of Eurodollar futures contracts. \nIn addition to changes in interest rates, other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedging instruments, such as the shape of the yield curve, market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions. Accordingly, in the event of changes in actual interest rates, the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders.\nRepurchase Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had established borrowing facilities in the repurchase agreement market with a number of commercial banks and other financial institutions and had borrowings in place with six of these counterparties. We believe these facilities provide borrowing capacity in excess of our needs. None of these lenders are affiliated with the Company. These borrowings are secured by our MBS and cash.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had obligations outstanding under the repurchase agreements of approximately $200.4 million with a net weighted average borrowing cost of 2.56%. The remaining maturity of our outstanding repurchase agreement obligations ranged from 9 to 50 days, with a weighted average maturity of 31 days. Securing the repurchase agreement obligation as of December 31, 2018 are MBS with an estimated fair value, including accrued interest, of $213.1 million and a weighted average maturity of 322 months, and cash posted as collateral of $230,000. Through March 20, 2019, we have been able to maintain our repurchase facilities with comparable terms to those that existed at December 31, 2018 with maturities through June 7, 2019.\nThe table below presents information about our period-end and average repurchase agreement obligations for each quarter in 2018 and 2017.\n\n (1) The higher ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 reflects the growth of the portfolio. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company's investment in PT MBS increased $56.1 million. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is our ability to turn non-cash assets into cash, purchase additional investments, repay principal and interest on borrowings, fund overhead and fulfill margin calls. Our principal immediate sources of liquidity include cash balances, unencumbered assets, the availability to borrow under repurchase agreements, and fees and dividends received from Orchid. Our borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our interest earning assets varies. Our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on-going basis through payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio. As further described in Note 4 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company exercised its optional early termination rights and received net distributions of approximately $1.4 million. That distribution, along with the cash flow of approximately $0.4 million received prior to the exercise, resulted in a gain of $1.1 million for the year that was recorded in gains on retained interests in securitizations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Historically, the ongoing regular cash flows from these retained interest positions provided the Company with liquidity, however, the predictability of such cash flows diminished during 2018 which contributed to the decision to terminate and collect a one-time final distribution. Future cash flows from the remaining unterminated positions is expected to be negligible. Management believes that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for (a) the acquisition of additional investments consistent with the size and nature of our existing MBS portfolio, (b) the repayments on borrowings, (c) the payment of overhead and operating expenses, and the payment of other accrued obligations.\nOur strategy for hedging our funding costs typically involves taking short positions in Eurodollar futures, T-Note futures, swaptions or other instruments. Since inception we have primarily used short positions in Eurodollar futures. When the market causes these short positions to decline in value we are required to meet margin calls with cash. This can reduce our liquidity position to the extent other securities in our portfolio move in price in such a way that we do not receive enough cash through margin calls to offset the Eurodollar related margin calls. If this were to occur in sufficient magnitude, the loss of liquidity might force us to reduce the size of the levered portfolio, pledge additional structured securities to raise funds or risk operating the portfolio with less liquidity.\nOur master repurchase agreements have no stated expiration, but can be terminated at any time at our option or at the option of the counterparty. However, once a definitive repurchase agreement under a master repurchase agreement has been entered into, it generally may not be terminated by either party. A negotiated termination can occur, but may involve a fee to be paid by the party seeking to terminate the repurchase agreement transaction.\nUnder our repurchase agreement funding arrangements, we are required to post margin at the initiation of the borrowing. The margin posted represents the haircut, which is a percentage of the market value of the collateral pledged. To the extent the market value of the asset collateralizing the financing transaction declines, the market value of our posted margin will be insufficient and we will be required to post additional collateral. Conversely, if the market value of the asset pledged increases in value, we would be over collateralized and we would be entitled to have excess margin returned to us by the counterparty. Our lenders typically value our pledged securities daily to ensure the adequacy of our margin and make margin calls as needed, as do we. Typically, but not always, the parties agree to a minimum threshold amount for margin calls so as to avoid the need for nuisance margin calls on a daily basis. Our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis.\nAs discussed above, we invest a portion of our capital in structured MBS. We generally do not apply leverage to this portion of our portfolio. The leverage inherent in structured securities replaces the leverage obtained by acquiring PT securities and funding them in the repurchase market. This structured MBS strategy has been a core element of the Company's overall investment strategy since 2008. However, we have and may continue to pledge a portion of our structured MBS in order to raise our cash levels, but generally will not pledge these securities in order to acquire additional assets.\nIn future periods we expect to continue to finance our activities through repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 million. We generated cash flows of $31.8 million from principal and interest payments on our MBS portfolio and had average repurchase agreements outstanding of $193.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $7.8 million in management fees and expense reimbursements as manager of Orchid and approximately $1.6 million in dividends from our investment in Orchid common stock. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately $1.4 million in connection with the termination of certain securitizations associated with our retained interests. We do not expect to generate cash in similar transactions in future periods.\nThe table below summarizes the effect that certain future contractual obligations existing as of December 31, 2018 will have on our liquidity and cash flows.\n\n (1) Interest expense on repurchase agreements and junior subordinated notes are based on current interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and the remaining term of liabilities existing at that date. \n (2) The Company holds a common equity interest in Bimini Capital Trust II. The amount presented represents the net cash outlay of the Company. \nOutlook\nOrchid Island Capital Inc.\nTo the extent Orchid is able to increase its capital base over time, we will benefit via increased management fees. In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for direct expenses paid on its behalf and to pay to us Orchid's pro rata share of overhead as defined in the management agreement. As a stockholder of Orchid, we will also continue to share in distributions, if any, paid by Orchid to its stockholders. Our operating results are also impacted by changes in the market value of our holdings of Orchid common shares, although these market value changes do not impact our cash flows from Orchid.\nThe independent Board of Directors of Orchid has the ability to terminate the management agreement and thus end our ability to collect management fees and share overhead costs. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will pay us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the current automatic renewal term.\nInterest Rates and the MBS Market\nThe fourth quarter of 2018 was pivotal. The trajectory of the growth rate of the U.S. economy, the level of interest rates, and expectations for monetary policy on the part of the Federal Reserve (the Fed\u201d) changed dramatically during the quarter. In early October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the Dow\u201d) hit an all-time high level, West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) crude hit a multi-year high, the unemployment rate dropped to a 49-year low and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a multi-year high yield. The Fed appeared fully committed to extending its rate hike regime as Chairman Powell stated the Fed was a long way from neutral at this point,\u201d and that we may go past neutral.\u201d The market fully expected the Fed to continue its gradual rate hikes into 2019 at that point, although market pricing reflected two additional rate hikes in 2019 versus the three reflected in the Fed's Dot Plots.\u201d Over the course of the quarter, the outlook changed dramatically.\nOver the first two months of the fourth quarter conditions that had previously been supportive of this outlook changed. Growth rates in a few countries in Europe were slightly negative in Q3 of 2018. Industrial production, the primary engine of growth for key export-oriented countries in the European Union, turned negative on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Growth in China slowed over the course of the year as each successive quarter was lower than the last, finally hitting 6.4% for the fourth quarter of 2018. China's growth rate for the entire year was the lowest in 28 years. Earnings reports released by many large US corporations for the third quarter, released in October and November, contained generally down-beat forward guidance. Management teams frequently referenced both the effects of tariffs imposed on imports during 2018 and slowing growth in Europe, China and the balance of global markets. Domestic economic data - outside of labor market related data - softened, especially the ISM data released in early December (for the month of November), which showed one of the sharpest declines in many years. The final development that shook the markets was the partial government shutdown, which lasted a record 5 weeks. As the year came to a close all risk markets performed very badly. The equity markets in the US, as measured by the broad indices - the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq - erased essentially all of their year-to-date gains and entered bear-market territory. Commodity prices declined, with WTI crude oil decreasing by over 43% (peak to trough) during the quarter. Liquidity in risk markets - typically low over the course of the last two weeks of the year due to holiday absences - was acutely poor in late 2018. Funding levels over the turn of the year were abnormally high - and in extreme instances more than double levels seen earlier in the year. The yield on the 10-year US treasury note rallied by over 68 bps - peak to trough - during the quarter. By the end of the year market pricing - as reflected in Fed funds futures - was for a cut in rates from the current level at some point over 2019 and 2020.\nThe Fed took notice of the material change in market sentiment that occurred over the course of the quarter. The Fed did raise rates at its December meeting - the ninth increase for the current cycle which began in December of 2015. However, the tone of the Fed, as reflected in both its press release issued at the conclusion of the meeting and during Chairman Powell's press conference - seemed to have changed. The Chairman stated that the Fed now saw the current level of the overnight Fed funds rate as being at the bottom end of the range of what it considered neutral. The Chairman acknowledged the FOMC's awareness of ongoing market events. Finally, at its January 2019 meeting, the Fed stated its policy rate is now in the range of the FOMC's estimate of neutral. More importantly, the FOMC now viewed itself as data dependent and that market conditions would determine its next move, whether that be a rate hike or cut. This represented a dramatic shift in the Fed policy outlook and was perceived as quite dovish by the markets. Risk markets quickly rallied and have continued to do so in early 2019.\nAs we enter 2019, the outlook is far different than it was at the end of the third quarter. The risks to the economic outlook - at least in the eyes of the market - are now clearly to the downside. Risks include a potential hard Brexit\u201d for the United Kingdom from the European Union, very weak growth in Europe and China, the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, and the prospect that all of these factors will cause growth in the U.S. to slow materially. The market now sees at most one more Fed rate hike in 2019 and likely cuts by the end of 2020.\nThe Agency MBS market reacted to market developments during the fourth quarter of 2018 negatively before the market turmoil became severe during the last five weeks of the quarter. The current coupon, 30-year fixed rate Agency MBS traded at a spread of approximately 0.74% to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note on October 3, 2018, but then widened to spread just above 0.90% on November 23, 2018. As the market turmoil intensified and interest rates began a sharp rally in late November, the current coupon Agency MBS performed well and ended the quarter at a spread to the same U.S. Treasury benchmark of approximately 0.82% and eventually reached 0.75% by the end of January 2019. For the quarter, the Bloomberg Agency MBS index returned 2.08%, and 0.99% for the full year of 2018. However, the performance was very uneven among the various coupons and maturities of the index. Lower coupon securities performed much better than higher coupon securities owing to the worse convexity and increased prepayment expectations of higher coupon securities. As was the case at the end of the third quarter of 2018, recent production of Agency MBS has frequently had characteristics that negatively impact the anticipated total returns of the securities. In this case the spread between the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgage loans and the net rate received by the investor is quite high. This leads to higher prepayment activity for the given coupon versus more typical spreads. Also, average loan balances appear higher than what market participants are accustomed to and average FICO scores are higher as well. All three of these factors tend to increase prepayment expectations and negatively impact expected returns for the securities. This concern was heightened as the Mortgage Bankers Association's refi index, after declining during the fourth quarter from approximately 950 at the beginning of the quarter to below 750 at the end of the quarter, increased dramatically to near 1180 during January 2019. Going forward, with prevailing mortgage rates available to borrowers now below 4.5%, versus 4.94% for the week of November 8, 2018, combined with the fact seasonal refinancing activity is due to increase in the coming months, we believe that the prepayment characteristics of various securities will be the driver of relative performance.\nRecent Regulatory Developments\nIn September 2017, the FOMC announced that it would implement a balance sheet normalization policy by gradually decreasing the Fed's reinvestment of U.S. Treasuries and Agency MBS. More specifically, principal payments received by the Fed will be reinvested only to the extent they exceed gradually rising caps until the FOMC determines that the Fed is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. In October 2017, the FOMC commenced this balance sheet normalization program. In October 2018, the Fed reached its terminal cap of $20 billion per month. Going forward, the Fed will only purchase Agency MBS to the extent paydowns on the Fed's holdings exceed $20 billion in any given month. These steps have been referred to as the Fed's balance sheet normalization.\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made statements following the January 2019 meeting that the Fed is evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of the balance sheet normalization and will finalize its plan to do so at a later meeting. In its January 30, 2019 release, the Fed said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\nIn 2017, policymakers announced that LIBOR will be replaced by 2021. The directive was spurred by the fact that banks are uncomfortable contributing to the LIBOR panel given the shortage of underlying transactions on which to base levels and the liability associated with submitting an unfounded level. LIBOR will be replaced with a new SOFR, a rate based on U.S. repo trading. The new benchmark rate will be based on overnight Treasury General Collateral repo rates. The rate-setting process will be managed and published by the Fed and the Treasury's Office of Financial Research. Many banks believe that it may take four to five years to complete the transition to SOFR, despite the 2021 deadline. We will monitor the emergence of this new rate carefully as it will likely become the new benchmark for hedges and a range of interest rate investments.\nIn January 2019, the Trump administration made statements of its plans to work with Congress to overhaul Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and expectations to announce a framework for the development of a policy for comprehensive housing finance reform soon. At this time, however, no decisions have been made on any reform plan.\nThe scope and nature of the actions the U.S. government or the Fed will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve. Although the Trump administration has made statements of its intentions to reform housing finance and tax policy, many of these potential policy changes will require congressional action. In addition, the Fed has made statements regarding additional increases to the Federal Funds Rate in 2019 and beyond.\nEffect on Us\nRegulatory developments, movements in interest rates and prepayment rates affect us in many ways, including the following:\nEffects on our Assets\nA change in or elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may increase our costs (if, for example, guarantee fees increase) or require us to change our investment strategy altogether. For example, the elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may cause us to change our investment strategy to focus on non-Agency MBS, which in turn would require us to significantly increase our monitoring of the credit risks of our investments in addition to interest rate and prepayment risks.\nLower long-term interest rates can affect the value of our Agency MBS in a number of ways. If prepayment rates are relatively low (due, in part, to the refinancing problems described above), lower long-term interest rates can increase the value of higher-coupon Agency MBS. This is because investors typically place a premium on assets with yields that are higher than market yields. Although lower long-term interest rates may increase asset values in our portfolio, we may not be able to invest new funds in similarly-yielding assets.\nIf prepayment levels increase, the value of our Agency MBS affected by such prepayments may decline. This is because a principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency MBS, which would shorten the period during which an investor would receive above-market returns (assuming the yield on the prepaid asset is higher than market yields). Also, prepayment proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in similar-yielding assets. Agency MBS backed by mortgages with high interest rates are more susceptible to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are most likely to refinance to a lower rate. IOs and IIOs, however, may be the types of Agency MBS most sensitive to increased prepayment rates. Because the holder of an IO or IIO receives no principal payments, the values of IOs and IIOs are entirely dependent on the existence of a principal balance on the underlying mortgages. If the principal balance is eliminated due to prepayment, IOs and IIOs essentially become worthless. Although increased prepayment rates can negatively affect the value of our IOs and IIOs, they have the opposite effect on POs. Because POs act like zero-coupon bonds, meaning they are purchased at a discount to their par value and have an effective interest rate based on the discount and the term of the underlying loan, an increase in prepayment rates would reduce the effective term of our POs and accelerate the yields earned on those assets, which would increase our net income.\nHigher long-term rates can also affect the value of our Agency MBS. As long-term rates rise, rates available to borrowers also rise. This tends to cause prepayment activity to slow and extend the expected average life of mortgage cash flows. As the expected average life of the mortgage cash flows increases, coupled with higher discount rates, the value of Agency MBS declines. Some of the instruments the Company uses to hedge our Agency MBS assets, such as Euro Dollar futures, swaps, interest rate futures and swaptions, are stable average life instruments. This means that to the extent we use such instruments to hedge our Agency MBS assets, our hedges may not adequately protect us from price declines, and therefore may negatively impact our book value. It is for this reason we use interest only securities in our portfolio. As interest rates rise, the expected average life of these securities increases, causing generally positive price movements as the number and size of the cash flows increase the longer the underlying mortgages remain outstanding. This makes interest only securities desirable hedge instruments for pass-through Agency MBS.\nAs the economy has rebounded from the financial crisis, the Fed has taken steps to remove the considerable accommodation that was employed to combat the crisis. At the conclusion of its meeting in September 2017, the Fed announced it would implement caps on the amount of Agency MBS assets it would allow to run off, or not be re-invested, starting in October 2017. Previously the Fed would re-invest all of the principal repayments it received each month on the Agency MBS assets it had acquired during its quantitative easing programs. By capping the amount they would allow to run off each month, the Fed was effectively limiting the amount it would re-invest. Pursuant to the Fed's September 2017 announcement, the cap reached $20 billion per month in October 2018. At the time of the Fed's announcement in September 2017, its monthly re-investments were approximately $20 billion per month as well, so this implied the Fed would stop, or nearly stop, re-investing its monthly pay-downs beyond October 2018. The purchases each month by the Fed have been a significant source of demand in the Agency MBS market and as it is reduced slowly over the course of 2018 and essentially eliminated beyond October 2018, the removal of this source of demand could negatively impact Agency MBS prices. The extent this negatively impacts the Agency MBS market will be a function of the level of supply each month - as the supply/demand balance affects the price of any asset - and whether or not another source of demand emerges to replace the Fed. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made statements following the January 2019 meeting that the Fed is evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of the balance sheet normalization and will finalize its plan to do so at a later meeting. In its January 30, 2019 release, the Fed said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\u2003\nBecause we base our investment decisions on risk management principles rather than anticipated movements in interest rates, in a volatile interest rate environment we may allocate more capital to structured Agency MBS with shorter durations, such as short-term fixed and floating rate CMOs. We believe these securities have a lower sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates than other asset classes. We may attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates by investing in IOs and IIOs, which typically have different sensitivities to changes in long-term interest rates than PT MBS, particularly PT MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages.\nEffects on our borrowing costs\nWe leverage our PT MBS portfolio and a portion of our structured Agency MBS with principal balances through the use of short-term repurchase agreement transactions. The interest rates on our debt are determined by market levels of both the Federal Funds Rate and LIBOR. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR would increase our borrowing costs, which could affect our interest rate spread if there is no corresponding increase in the interest we earn on our assets. This would be most prevalent with respect to our Agency MBS backed by fixed rate mortgage loans because the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage loan does not change even though market rates may change.\nIn order to protect our net interest margin against increases in short-term interest rates, we may enter into interest rate swaps, which economically convert our floating-rate repurchase agreement debt to fixed-rate debt, or utilize other hedging instruments such as Eurodollar and T-Note futures contracts or interest rate swaptions.\nSummary\nThe U.S. economy appears to have fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008. Growth has accelerated, reaching 4% annualized in the second quarter of 2018 and 3.4% in the third quarter. The economic data has in many cases reached multi-year or, in some cases, multi-decade levels. The economy appeared to have considerable momentum as it entered the fourth quarter. The Fed raised rates for the ninth time at its December meeting and, up until then, seemed intent on continuing to do so into 2020. This trajectory abruptly changed during the fourth quarter due to a combination of factors. Growth in Europe and China slowed significantly throughout 2018 and hit a recent trough late in the year. Great Britain is faced with the potential for a hard Brexit\u201d from the European Union, the federal government had a five week partial shutdown around the turn of the year and domestic economic data, at least non-labor market related data, has softened. Financial markets in the U.S. and globally experienced significant turmoil during the fourth quarter with returns for the year generally erased entirely. Interest rates, after hitting multi-year highs early in the quarter, declined by over 60 bps in the case of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. The policy stance of the Fed has changed to a balanced outlook, with data dependency the driver of further rate decisions - whether up or down.\nThe Bloomberg Agency MBS index generated a return of 2.08% for the quarter, although this return number masks the fact the performance of the sector was very uneven, both in time and across the various securities that make up the index. The Agency MBS market performed poorly though the end of November, as the spread of the 30-year, current coupon Agency MBS widened in spread to the 10-year U.S. treasury note by over 0.15%. However, as the market turmoil became more severe and rates rallied close to 2.50% in the case of the 10-year note - versus above 3.20% at the beginning of the quarter - Agency MBS did very well (as an index). However, with the decline in rates prepayment fears and convexity concerns intensified, resulting in very uneven performance for the index. Longer duration, lower coupon securities performed very well, while higher coupon, shorter duration securities performed quite badly. Given the new rate environment and lack of concern surrounding future rate hikes, we believe that the mortgage market will be driven by prepayment characteristics going forward.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires our management to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments which could significantly affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management has identified its most critical accounting estimates:\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nOur investments in MBS are accounted for under the fair value option. We acquire our MBS for the purpose of generating long-term returns, and not for the short-term investment of idle capital. Changes in the fair value of securities accounted for under the fair value option are reflected as part of our net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations, as opposed to a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of stockholder's equity if they were instead reclassified as available-for-sale securities. We elected to account for all of our MBS under the fair value option in order to reflect changes in the fair value of our MBS in our consolidated statement of operations, which we believe more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period. GAAP requires the use of a three-level valuation hierarchy to disclose the classification of fair value measurements used for determining the fair value of our MBS. These levels include:\n \u00b7 Level 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume), \n \u00b7 Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market, and \n \u00b7 Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company- specific data. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. \nOur MBS are valued using Level 2 valuations, and such valuations currently are determined based on independent pricing sources and/or third party broker quotes when available. Because the price estimates may vary, management must make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use to calculate the fair values. Alternatively, the Company could opt to have the value of all of our positions in MBS determined by either an independent third-party or do so internally. In managing our portfolio, the Company employs the following four-step process at each valuation date to determine the fair value of our MBS.\n \u00b7 First, the Company obtains fair values from subscription-based independent pricing services. \n \u00b7 Second, the Company requests non-binding quotes from one to four broker-dealers for certain MBS in order to validate the values obtained by the pricing service. The Company requests these quotes from broker-dealers that actively trade and make markets in the respective asset class for which the quote is requested. \n \u00b7 Third, the Company reviews the values obtained by the pricing source and the broker-dealers for consistency across similar assets. \n \u00b7 Finally, if the data from the pricing services and broker-dealers is not homogenous or if the data obtained is inconsistent with management's market observations, the Company makes a judgment to determine which price appears the most consistent with observed prices from similar assets and selects that price. To the extent management believes that none of the prices are consistent with observed prices for similar assets, which is typically the case for only an immaterial portion of our portfolio each quarter, the Company may use a third price that is consistent with observed prices for identical or similar assets. In the case of assets that have quoted prices such as Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages, the Company generally uses the quoted or observed market price. For assets such as Agency MBS backed by ARMs or structured Agency MBS, the Company may determine the price based on the yield or spread that is identical to an observed transaction or a similar asset for which a dealer mark or subscription-based price has been obtained. \nManagement believes its pricing methodology to be consistent with the definition of fair value described in FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nInvestment in Orchid Island Capital, Inc. Common Stock\nThe Company has elected the fair value option for its investment in Orchid common shares. The change in the fair value of this investment and dividends received on this investment are reflected in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the fair value of our investment in Orchid on a market approach using Level 1\u201d inputs based on the quoted market price of Orchid's common stock on the NYSE. Electing the fair value option requires the Company to record changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations, which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period and is consistent with how the investment is managed.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nRetained interests in the subordinated tranches of securities created in securitization transactions were initially recorded at their fair value when issued by Royal Palm. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are reflected in earnings. Quoted market prices for these assets are generally not available, so the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management's best estimates of key assumptions, which include expected credit losses, prepayment speeds, weighted-average life, and discount rates commensurate with the inherent risks of the asset.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate asset/liability strategies and manage other exposures, and we may continue to do so in the future. The principal instruments that we have used to date are T-Note and Eurodollar futures contracts and interest rate swaptions, but we may enter into other derivatives in the future.\nWe have elected not to treat any of our derivative financial instruments as hedges in order to align the accounting treatment of our derivative instruments with the treatment of our portfolio assets under the fair value option election. FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging, requires that all derivative instruments be carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in earnings for each period.\nIncome Recognition\nAll of our MBS are either PT MBS or structured MBS, including CMOs, IOs, IIOs or POs. Income on PT MBS, POs and CMOs that contain principal balances is based on the stated interest rate of the security. As a result of accounting for our MBS under the fair value option, premium or discount present at the date of purchase is not amortized. For IOs, IIOs and CMOs that do not contain principal balances, income is accrued based on the carrying value and the effective yield. As cash is received it is first applied to accrued interest and then to reduce the carrying value of the security. At each reporting date, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively from the reporting period based on the new estimate of prepayments, current interest rates and current asset prices. The new effective yield is calculated based on the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, the new prepayment estimates and the contractual terms of the security. Changes in fair value of all of our MBS during the period are recorded in earnings and reported as unrealized gains or losses on mortgage-backed securities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For IIO securities, effective yield and income recognition calculations also take into account the index value applicable to the security.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The measurement of net deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance if, based on the Company's evaluation, it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. A majority of the Company's net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by the revenue forecasts of management fees, Orchid dividends and net interest income, and the subsequent reinvestment of those amounts into the MBS portfolio over the extended period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could lead management to reassess its valuation allowance conclusions.\nThe Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for years ended on or after December 31, 2015 remain open for examination. Although management believes its calculations for tax returns are correct and the positions taken thereon are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits could be materially different from the tax returns filed by the Company, and those differences could result in significant costs or benefits to the Company.\nThe Company measures, recognizes and presents its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under that guidance, the Company assesses the likelihood, based on their technical merit, that tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the facts, circumstances and information available at the end of each period. The measurement of uncertain tax positions is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that requires a change. The Company recognizes tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit and is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within the income tax provision.\nCapital Expenditures\nAt December 31, 2018, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.", "item_7_tables": "Table 90: <table> <tr> <td> (in
