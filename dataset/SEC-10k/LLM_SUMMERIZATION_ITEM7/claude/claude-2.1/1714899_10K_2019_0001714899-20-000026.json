MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the section titled Selected Financial and Other Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our intentions, plans, objectives, expectations, forecasts and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nOur goal is to discover and develop therapeutics to defeat degeneration.\nOur strategy is guided by three overarching principles that we believe will significantly increase the probability of success and will accelerate the timing to bring effective therapeutics to patients with neurodegenerative diseases:\n\u2022Genetic Pathway Potential: We select our therapeutic targets and disease pathways based on genes that, when mutated, cause, or are major risk factors for, neurodegenerative diseases. We refer to these genes as degenogenes;\n\u2022Engineering Brain Delivery: We engineer our product candidates to cross the blood-brain barrier and act directly in the brain; and\n\u2022Biomarker-Driven Development: We discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to select the right patient population and demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and impact on disease progression of our product candidates.\nWe are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our programs are at different stages of clinical and preclinical development, including five programs in clinical studies.\nWe have also developed a proprietary blood-brain barrier (\"BBB\") platform technology, our transport vehicle (\"TV\"), which enables multiple modality-based platforms to deliver a wide range of large-molecule therapeutics across the BBB, including enzymes, antibodies, proteins and oligonucleotides. This technology is designed to engage specific BBB transport receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed in brain capillaries and facilitate transport of proteins into the brain. We are currently optimizing and broadening this platform technology.\nOur five clinical programs are:\n\u2022our leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (\"LRRK2\") inhibitor program to address Parkinson's disease;\n\u2022our receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (\"RIPK1\") inhibitor program, partnered with Sanofi, to address neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"ALS\");\n\u2022a second RIPK1 inhibitor that our partner Sanofi is developing to address peripheral inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis;\n\u2022our EIF2B activator program to address diseases such as ALS and FTD; and\n\u2022our ETV:IDS program, our most advanced program enabled by our TV technology, which is designed to restore iduronate 2-sulfatase (\"IDS\"), and reduce glycosaminoglycans (\"GAGs\"), both peripherally and in the brain, in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II (\"MPS II\", or \"Hunter syndrome\").\nThe following table summarizes key information about our clinical stage programs:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Program </td> <td> </td> <td>Product Candidate(s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Clinical Phase </td> <td> </td> <td>Indication(s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Operational Control </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LRRK2 </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL201 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1b (complete) </td> <td> </td> <td>Parkinson's disease </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL151 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 and Ph 1b </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIPK1 (CNS) </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL747 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1b </td> <td> </td> <td>Alzheimer's disease </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1b </td> <td> </td> <td>ALS </td> <td> </td> <td>Sanofi </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIPK1 (Peripheral) </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL758 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Systemic inflammatory diseases </td> <td> </td> <td>Sanofi </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EIF2B </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL343 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>ALS and FTD </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ETV:IDS </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL310 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 (study startup) </td> <td> </td> <td>Hunter syndrome </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo complement our internal capabilities, we have entered into arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, patient-focused data companies, numerous leading academic institutions and foundations to gain access to new product candidates, enable and accelerate the development of our existing programs and deepen our scientific understanding of certain areas of biology. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We currently do not need commercial manufacturing capacity.\nSince we commenced operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to discovering, acquiring and developing product candidates, building our BBB platform technology and assembling our core capabilities in understanding key neurodegenerative disease pathways.\nKey operational and financing milestones for the year ended December 31, 2019 and in 2020 to date include:\n\u2022In February 2019, we received a payment of $5.0 million related to a preclinical milestone earned in December 2018 under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement;\n\u2022In January 2019, we announced, in collaboration with our partner Sanofi, the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL747 in ALS patients, and in February 2019, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL747 in Alzheimer's disease patients;\n\u2022In February 2019, DNL310 (ETV:IDS) was granted orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA;\n\u2022In April 2019, we completed our move to our new headquarters location;\n\u2022In July 2019, our partner Sanofi commenced dosing of our partnered small molecule RIPK1 inhibitor, DNL758, in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers. This triggered a milestone payment of $10.0 million, which was received in August 2019;\n\u2022In September 2019, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL151 in patients with Parkinson's disease, and the launch of our Engage Parkinson's website;\n\u2022In October 2019, we enrolled the first patient in a biomarker study for our ETV:IDS program in Hunter Syndrome. This non-interventional study is expected to yield critical biomarker and clinical data in patients to inform future clinical studies with DNL310 (ETV:IDS) and facilitate patient recruitment into these studies;\n\u2022In November 2019, we announced progress of our DNL747 Phase 1b trials in Alzheimer's disease and ALS, commencement of enrollment of an ALS open label extension in the Netherlands and expansion of sites for the Phase 1b ALS study into the United States. We intend, together with our partner Sanofi, to evaluate the full data set from the ongoing clinical and preclinical studies to inform decisions on further clinical testing for our RIPK1 program. The timing of such decisions is mid-2020;\n\u2022In January 2020, the IND for DNL310 (ETV:IDS) was accepted. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 study for DNL310 in Hunter syndrome patients in the first half of 2020.\n\u2022In January 2020, we announced positive results from our LRRK2 program. Phase 1b results with DNL201 in patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated high levels of target and pathway engagement and improvement of lysosomal biomarkers. Phase 1 results with DNL151 in more than 150 healthy volunteers also met all safety and biomarker goals. We plan to select one of these two molecules for Phase 2/3 studies in patients with and without the LRRK2 mutation in mid-2020.\n\u2022In January 2020, we sold 9.0 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $23.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $194.1 million.\n\u2022In February 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for DNL343 in healthy volunteers.\nWe do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product revenue since our inception. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, the proceeds from our IPO and our follow on offering, and payments received from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $197.6 million, $36.2 million and $88.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $425.6 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we advance our current clinical stage programs through healthy volunteer and patient trials; broaden and improve our BBB platform technology; acquire, discover, validate and develop additional product candidates; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel.\nLicense and Collaboration Agreements\nTakeda\nIn January 2018, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Takeda ( Takeda Collaboration Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option with respect to three of our programs to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, certain biologic products that are enabled by our BBB delivery technology and intended for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The three programs were Denali's ATV:BACE1/Tau, ATV:TREM2 and PTV:PGRN programs. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018 when the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\"HSR\") were satisfied. In February 2019, we amended the Takeda Collaboration Agreement to replace the ATV:BACE1/Tau program with the ATV:Tau program.\nUnder the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Takeda paid us a $40.0 million upfront payment, and is obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $25.0 million with respect to each program under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement directed to a target and based upon the achievement of certain preclinical milestone events, up to $75.0 million in total, of which we have earned and received $15.0 million to date. Takeda is also obligated to pay us a $5.0 million option fee for each target for which Takeda exercises its option, up to $15.0 million in total.\nPursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Takeda in January 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Takeda agreed to purchase, 4,214,559 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $110.0 million. We closed the sale of the 4,214,559 shares of our common stock to Takeda on February 23, 2018.\nAfter Takeda exercises its option for a particular target, we and Takeda will share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, the profits, for each collaboration program. However, for each collaboration program, we may elect not to continue sharing development and commercialization costs, or Takeda may elect to terminate our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations if, following notice from Takeda and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost sharing obligations with respect to the relevant collaboration program. After such an election by us or termination by Takeda becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the relevant collaboration program, and we will not share in any profits from that collaboration program. Instead we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties. The royalty rates will be in the low- to mid-teen percentages on net sales, or low- to high-teen percentages on net sales if we have met a certain co-funding threshold at the time of our election to opt out of co-development or Takeda's termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations, and, in each case, these royalty rates will be subject to certain reductions specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Takeda will pay these royalties to us for each biologic product included in the relevant collaboration program, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant biologic product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that biologic product, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that biologic product in the applicable country, unless biosimilar competition in excess of a significant level specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement occurs earlier, in which case Takeda's royalty obligations in the applicable country would terminate.\nIn addition, if Takeda exercises its option for all three collaboration programs, Takeda may be obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $407.5 million upon achievement of certain clinical milestone events and up to an aggregate of $300.0 million in regulatory milestone events relating to receipt of regulatory approval in the United States, certain European countries and Japan. Takeda may also be obligated to pay us up to $75.0 million per biologic product upon achievement of a certain sales-based milestone, or an aggregate of $225.0 million if one biologic product from each program achieves this milestone.\nWe have recognized collaboration revenue of $5.9 million and $5.7 million associated with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recorded a receivable from Takeda of $5.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We did not have a receivable from Takeda as of December 31, 2019. Through December 31, 2019, we have received $15.0 million in preclinical milestone payments from Takeda and have not recorded any product sales under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.\nSanofi\nIn October 2018, we entered into the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which certain small molecule CNS and peripheral RIPK1 inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and by Denali will be developed and commercialized. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018 when the HSR requirements were satisfied. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi paid us a $125.0 million upfront payment. Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $215.0 million in clinical milestone payments and $385.0 million in regulatory milestone payments for CNS Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") and in Japan for three indications, including Alzheimer's disease. These milestones also include $120.0 million in clinical milestone payments, $175.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and $200.0 million in commercial milestone payments for Peripheral Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the EMA and in Japan for three indications. Through December 31, 2019, we have received milestone payments of $10.0 million under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nDenali will share profits and losses equally with Sanofi for CNS Products sold in the United States and China, and receive royalties on net sales for CNS Products outside of the United States and China and for Peripheral Products sold worldwide, each as further described below. RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and developed and commercialized under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement will be subject to lower milestone and royalty payments to us compared to RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by us. We will also retain responsibility for certain payment obligations under our agreement with an academic institution which licensed certain intellectual property to us that we are sublicensing to Sanofi under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nDenali and Sanofi will jointly develop CNS Products pursuant to a global development plan. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the conduct of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products for Alzheimer's disease and any activities required to support such clinical trials and specific for Alzheimer's disease. We will also conduct, at Sanofi's cost, a Phase 1b trial for DNL747 for ALS. Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for all other Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products, including for multiple sclerosis. Sanofi will lead the conduct of all Phase 3 and later stage development trials for CNS Products, with Sanofi funding 70% of such costs and Denali funding 30% of such costs. We have the ability to opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as further described below.\nSanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for CNS Products. We may elect to conduct certain co-commercialization activities outside of MS with respect to each CNS Product in the United States and/or China, provided that the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for the relevant CNS Product are still in effect, as further described below.\nWe may opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for CNS Products in the United States and China on a CNS Product-by-CNS Product and country-by-country basis. Sanofi may also terminate our cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if, following notice from Sanofi and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost-sharing obligations. After such an opt out by us or termination by Sanofi, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the applicable CNS Products and we will not share in the applicable profits from such CNS Products. Instead, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable CNS Products in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates will be a percentage in the low double digits to mid-teens, but may increase to the mid-teens to low-twenties percentages for all countries in which Sanofi is paying royalties on the applicable CNS products, if we have met certain co-funding thresholds at the time of our election or Sanofi's termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations.\nSanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for conducting activities relating to the development and commercialization of all Peripheral Products. Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for Peripheral Products. We will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid- teen percentages on net sales of Peripheral Products.\nWe have recognized collaboration revenue of $20.8 million and $123.5 million associated with the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recorded a receivable from Sanofi of $1.2 million and $2.3 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Through December 31, 2019, we have received milestone payments of $10.0 million and have not recorded any product sales under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nF-star\nIn August 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (\"F-star Collaboration Agreement\") with F-star Gamma Limited ( F-star Gamma\u201d), F-star Biotechnologische Forschungs-Und Entwicklungsges m.b.H (\"F-star GmbH\") and F-star Biotechnology Limited (\"F-star Ltd\") (collectively, F-star\u201d). The goal of the collaboration is the development of Fcabs to enhance delivery of therapeutics across the BBB into the brain. The collaboration leverages F-star's modular antibody technology and our expertise in the development of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In connection with the entry into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we also purchased an option for an upfront option fee of $0.5 million, or the buy-out option, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma pursuant to a pre-negotiated buy-out option agreement (\"Option Agreement\").\nIn May 2018, we exercised such buy-out option and entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the shareholders of F-star Gamma and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma (the Acquisition\u201d).\nAs a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the entity's name was changed to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, we became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Ltd by way of our assumption of F-star Gamma's license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016, (the F-star Gamma License\u201d). We made initial exercise payments of $18.0 million in aggregate under the Purchase Agreement and the F-star Gamma License, less the net liabilities of F-star Gamma, which were approximately $0.2 million. In addition, we are required to make future contingent payments, to F-star Ltd and the former shareholders of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. These include up to $27.0 million in preclinical contingent payments, $50.0 million in clinical contingent payments, $120.0 million in regulatory contingent payments and $250.0 million in commercial contingent payments. The amount of the contingent payments will vary based on whether F-star delivers an Fcab (constant Fc-domains with antigen-binding activity) that meets pre-defined criteria and whether the Fcab has been identified solely by us or solely by F-star Ltd. or jointly by us and F-star Ltd. In June 2019, we made a payment of $1.5 million to F-star Ltd upon the achievement of a specified preclinical milestone in our ETV:IDS program.\nUnder the terms of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, we could nominate up to three Fcab targets ( Accepted Fcab Targets\u201d) within the first three years of the date of the F-star Collaboration Agreement. Upon entering into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we selected transferrin receptor ( TfR\u201d) as the first Accepted Fcab Target and paid F-star Gamma an upfront fee of $5.5 million, which included selection of the first Accepted Fcab Target. In May 2018, we exercised its right to nominate two additional Fcab Targets and identified a second Accepted Fcab Target. We are obligated to make a one-time payment for the two additional Accepted Fcab Targets of $6.0 million in the aggregate and have extended the time period for our selection of the third Accepted Fcab Target until approximately the fourth anniversary of the date of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, or August 2020.\nWe recognized $1.5 million and $18.3 million of contingent consideration as research and development expense in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A further $6.0 million for the nomination of two additional Accepted Fcab Targets under the F-star Collaboration Agreement was recognized as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, along with the upfront option fee of $0.5 million previously included within other non-current assets. We recognized an additional $1.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million of research and development expense related to the funding of F-star research costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGenentech\nIn June 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Genentech. The agreement gives us access to Genentech's LRRK2 inhibitor program. As consideration to date, we have paid Genentech $12.5 million in the aggregate, including an upfront fee, a technology transfer fee and a clinical milestone payment, all of which was recorded as research and development expense as incurred. No amounts were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. The first clinical milestone payment of $2.5 million was recorded as research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe may owe Genentech milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, up to a maximum of $315.0 million in the aggregate. These milestones include up to $37.5 million in clinical milestone payments, $102.5 million in regulatory milestone payments and $175.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, we may owe royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages, with the exact royalty rate dependent on various factors, including (i) whether the compound incorporated in the relevant licensed product is a Genentech-provided compound or a compound acquired or developed by us, (ii) the date a compound was first discovered, derived or optimized by us, (iii) the existence of patent rights covering the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, (iv) the existence of orphan drug exclusivity covering a licensed product that is a Genentech-provided compound and (v) the level of annual net sales of the relevant licensed product. We also have the right to credit a certain amount of third-party royalty and milestone payments against royalty and milestone payments owed to Genentech, up to a maximum reduction of fifty percent.\nUnless earlier terminated, the agreement with Genentech will continue in effect until all of our royalty and milestone payment obligations to Genentech expire. Following expiration of the agreement, we will retain the licenses under the intellectual property Genentech licensed to us on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis.\nComponents of Operating Results\nCollaboration Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. All revenue recognized to date has been collaboration revenue from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi.\nIn the future, we will continue to recognize revenue from the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement and may generate revenue from product sales or milestones, royalties and cost reimbursement from other collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We expect that our revenue will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, milestones, reimbursement of costs incurred and other payments and product sales, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We record research and development expenses as incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and BBB platform technology include:\n\u2022 external research and development expenses, including:\n\u2022expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), preclinical testing organizations, contract development and manufacturing organizations (\"CDMOs\"), academic and non-profit institutions and consultants;\n\u2022expenses to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use;\n\u2022fees related to our license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.\nA portion of our research and development expenses are direct external expenses, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced late-stage IND-enabling studies.\nProgram expenses include expenses associated with our most advanced product candidates and the discovery and development of backup or next-generation molecules. We also track external expenses associated with our BBB platform technology. These expenses include those incurred by us relating to our Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. All external costs associated with earlier stage programs, or that benefit the entire portfolio, are tracked as a group. We do not track personnel or other operating expenses incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, facility expenses including rent and depreciation, and lab consumables.\nIt is challenging to predict the nature, timing and estimated long-range costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022our ability to add and retain key research and development personnel;\n\u2022our ability to establish an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;\n\u2022our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates;\n\u2022our successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations;\n\u2022our ability to discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and the impact on disease progression of our molecules;\n\u2022our ability to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;\n\u2022the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates if and when approved;\n\u2022our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022the continued acceptable safety profiles of the product candidates following approval.\nA change in any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We expect our research and development expenses to increase at least over the next several years as we continue to implement our business strategy, advance our current programs, expand our research and development efforts, seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, access and develop additional product candidates and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include personnel-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, expenses for outside professional services and allocated expenses. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent, depreciation and other expenses related to our office and research and development facility not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe expect to continue to incur certain expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase our administrative headcount as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, which will also increase our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and investment income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, gains and losses on foreign currency hedges, and sublease income.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(102,482) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79) </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>193,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>46,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>239,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(213,184) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,370) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166,812) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income, net </td> <td>15,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(197,965) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(161,725) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(197,614) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(161,374) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>445 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration revenue. Collaboration revenue was $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $129.2 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $102.5 million was primarily due to a decrease of $102.7 million of revenue recognized under our Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in 2019.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program and category (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LRRK2 program external expenses\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIPK1 program external expenses\n</td> <td>12,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EIF2B program external expenses </td> <td>5,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ETV:IDS program external expenses </td> <td>14,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other BBB program external expenses </td> <td>14,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB platform external expenses\n</td> <td>1,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,043) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other external research and development expenses\n</td> <td>17,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related expenses(1)\n</td> <td>62,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unallocated research and development expenses\n</td> <td>32,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________________\n(1)Personnel-related expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $19.3 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting an increase of $9.2 million.\nThere was an increase in total research and development expenses of $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This reflects increases in external expenses related to progression of our portfolio, including the following: (i) an increase of $19.3 million in the LRRK2 program; (ii) an increase of $9.7 million in the ETV:IDS program; (iii) an increase of $8.9 million in other BBB delivery platform programs; (iv) an increase of $2.9 million in the EIF2B program; and (v) an increase of $8.8 million in other external research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in RIPK1 program external expenses. Further, there was a $20.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, consisting of a $11.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses attributable to an increase in our research and development headcount, and a $9.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily attributable to additional equity award grants and certain performance and market-based awards. There was also a $9.1 million increase in other unallocated research and development expenses, which was primarily due to an increase in facilities-related expenses of $5.4 million resulting from increased rent expense associated with the new headquarters lease, a $2.5 million increase in lab consumable expenses, and a $1.2 million increase in other general costs, such as travel and IT related expenses attributable to our research and development departments. These increases were partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in BBB platform external expense, the majority of which related to expenses incurred in 2018 associated with the acquisition of F-star Gamma Limited, and the nomination of two additional Fcab targets under the F-star Collaboration Agreement, both of which occurred in May 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $14.1 million was primarily attributable to the $12.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, driven by higher general and administrative headcount and stock-based compensation expense associated with additional equity award grants and certain performance and market-based awards. Additionally, there was a $1.0 million increase in facilities related expenses, including increased rent expense associated with the new headquarters lease and a $1.3 million increase in other general costs, such as travel, insurance, taxes and IT related expenses attributable to our general and administrative departments. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in legal and other professional service expenses.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $5.1 million reflects higher interest income due to a higher average cash balance in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Further, we received $2.6 million of sublease income in the year ended December 31, 2019 but no sublease income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit. Income tax benefit was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the tax benefit associated with an unrealized gain on marketable securities in other comprehensive income. There was no income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations\u201d in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, proceeds from our IPO, our follow on offering, and payments received from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi. On December 7, 2017, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued 15,972,221 shares of our common stock, including 2,083,333 shares sold pursuant the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $18.00 per share. We received $264.3 million from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses incurred by us.\nPursuant to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we have received $55.0 million related to upfront and milestone payments through December 31, 2019. Further, under the associated Purchase Agreement we received $110.0 million in February 2018 for the sale and issuance of 4,214,559 shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $125.0 million in November 2018, and a milestone payment of $10.0 million in August 2019, which was triggered by the commencement of a DNL758 Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. We have received further payments of $11.6 million for performance of Retained Activities through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amount of $455.2 million.\nIn January 2020, we sold 9.0 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $23.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately$194.1 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we expand our research and development activities and continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. Further, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur additional costs associated with supporting our growing operations. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates or from our existing collaboration agreements, or future agreements with other third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Additionally, any future collaborations we enter into with third parties may provide capital in the near term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of $425.6 million through December 31, 2019. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we conduct and expand our research and development activities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u2022the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\u2022the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we have entered into license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new research and development, license or collaboration arrangements;\n\u2022our ability and success in securing manufacturing relationships with third parties or, in the future, in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility;\n\u2022the costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;\n\u2022the cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022our efforts to enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022the costs and ongoing investments to in-license and/or acquire additional technologies.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(151,576) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(76,635) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>147,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(287,422) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,166) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>6,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>296,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(140,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $151.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $197.6 million, adjusted by non-cash items primarily related to stock-based compensation, depreciation, and non-cash rent expenses, partially offset by net amortization of discounts on marketable securities. Cash used in operating activities was also driven by changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $147.7 million, which consisted of $535.3 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities, partially offset by $369.7 million of purchases of marketable securities and $17.9 million of capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 million, which consisted entirely of proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock and issuance of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") shares.\nYears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma, our F-star Collaboration Agreement represented a variable interest in a variable interest entity, or VIE, F-star Gamma. However, we did not consolidate F-star Gamma in our consolidated financial statements because we had determined that we were not considered to be its primary beneficiary.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations under license and other contractual agreements (2)\n</td> <td>12,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________________\n(1)Represents future minimum lease payments under our headquarters lease. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes.\n(2)Represents non-cancellable fees due in connection with license and other contractual agreements, including those under the Lonza DMSA.\n(3)We enter into contracts in the normal course of business, primarily with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials, or for other services or supplies related to research and development activities. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and no arrangements include material stipulated commitment payments.\nIn May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our operating lease for our former corporate headquarters in South San Francisco (the \"Headquarters Lease Amendment\") to relocate and expand our headquarters to 148,020 rentable square feet in a building in South San Francisco, California (the \"New Premises\"). The Headquarters Lease Amendment has a contractual term of ten years from the legal commencement date, which was April 1, 2019 when the building was ready for occupancy. For accounting purposes, the lease commencement date was determined to be August 1, 2018, which was the date at which we were deemed to have obtained control over the property. We have an option to extend the lease term for a period of ten years by giving the landlord written notice of the election to exercise the option at least nine months, but not more than twelve months, prior to the expiration of the Headquarters Lease Amendment lease term. We determined that this renewal was not reasonably certain at lease inception.\nThe Headquarters Lease Amendment provides for monthly base rent amounts escalating over the term of the lease. In addition, the Headquarters Lease Amendment provided a tenant improvement allowance (\"TIA\") of up to $25.9 million, which was fully utilized, of which $4.4 million will be repaid to the landlord in the form of additional monthly rent. This is recorded as leasehold improvement assets and an offset to the lease ROU asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. We are also required to pay the operating expenses for the New Premises, such as taxes and insurance, which are treated as variable lease payments.\nEffective September 2017, we entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement as amended (\"DMSA\") with Lonza Sales AG (\"Lonza\") for the development and manufacture of biologic products. Under the DMSA, we will execute purchase orders based on project plans authorizing Lonza to provide development and manufacturing services with respect to certain of our antibody and enzyme products, and will pay for the services provided and batches delivered in accordance with the DMSA and project plan. Unless earlier terminated, the DMSA will expire on September 6, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had open non-cancellable purchase orders for biological product development and manufacturing costs totaling $21.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively. The activities under these purchase orders are expected to be completed by November 2024. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total non-refundable purchase commitments of $11.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, under the DMSA.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred costs of $12.7 million and $3.9 million, and made payments of $12.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA. We had not incurred any costs or made any payments for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPursuant to certain license agreements, including our agreement with Genentech, we have obligations to make future milestone and royalty payments to other parties. Additionally, we have certain contingent payments to F-star and former shareholders of F-star Gamma related to the acquisition of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate. However, we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones and, therefore, any related payments are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nLicense and Collaboration Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), using a full retrospective application. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09 as we had not recognized any revenue through December 31, 2017. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as collaboration arrangements and leases.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, within the scope of Topic 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. The accounting treatment pursuant to Topic 606 is outlined below.\nThe terms of licensing and collaboration agreements entered into typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply and research and development services; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments results in license, collaboration and other revenue, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenue. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.\nWe record amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the related performance obligation is expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months this will be classified in current liabilities. Amounts recognized as revenue prior to the Company having an unconditional right (other than a right that is conditioned only on the passage of time) to receipt are recorded as contract assets in our consolidated balance sheets. If we expect to have an unconditional right to receive the consideration in the next twelve months, this will be classified in current assets. A net contract asset or liability is presented for each contract with a customer.\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and identify those distinct goods and services that represent a performance obligation. A promised good or service may not be identified as a performance obligation if it is immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer, if it is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (either because it is not capable of being separated or because it is not separable in the context of the contract), or if the performance obligation does not provide the customer with a material right.\nWe consider the terms of the contract to determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. Variable consideration will only be included in the transaction price when it is not considered constrained, which is when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nIf it is determined that multiple performance obligations exist, the transaction price is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling prices (\"SSP\"). The relative SSP for each deliverable is estimated using external sourced evidence if it is available. If external sourced evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the SSP for the deliverable.\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset, which for a service is considered to be as the services are received and used. We recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward our complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\nAfter contract inception, the transaction price is reassessed at every period end and updated for changes such as resolution of uncertain events. Any change in the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations on the same basis as at contract inception.\nWe may be required to exercise considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized. Judgment is required in identifying performance obligations, estimating the transaction price, estimating the SSP of identified performance obligations, which may include forecasted revenue, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success, and estimating the progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe record research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and the development of our BBB platform technology and include: employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash stock-based compensation expense; external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, preclinical testing organizations, CDMOs, academic and non-profit institutions and consultants; costs to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use; license fees; and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.\nAs part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses. A portion of our research and development expenses are external costs, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced a late-stage IND-enabling study. We record the estimated expenses of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers based upon the estimated amount of services provided within research and development expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These services include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, contract manufacturing activities and consulting services. If the costs have been prepaid, this expense reduces the prepaid expenses in the balance sheet, and if not yet invoiced, the costs are included in accrued liabilities in the balance sheet. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We record amortization of prepaid expenses or accrued expenses for these costs based on the estimated amount of work completed and in accordance with agreements established with these third parties.\nCosts for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from external clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. To date, we have not experienced material differences between our accrued expenses and actual expenses. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and shares issued under its employee stock purchase plan to our employees, certain non-employee consultants and certain members of our board of directors. We measure stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options granted to our employees and directors on the date of grant. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2018-07, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting on September 30, 2018, future stock-based compensation expense for non-employee stock-based awards is measured based on the fair value on the date of adoption. We recognize the corresponding compensation expense of awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, and we adjust for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to our employees and directors and rights to acquire stock granted under our ESPP, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We use the fair value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\n\u2022Expected Term. Our expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term), as we do not have sufficient historical data to use any other method to estimate expected term.\n\u2022Expected Volatility. As we have very limited trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock option grants.\n\u2022Expected Dividend. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nDetermination of the estimated fair value of our common stock on grant dates prior to our IPO\nAs there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.\nWe periodically determined the estimated fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (\"Practice Aid\"). In accordance with the Practice Aid, our board of directors considered the Current Value Method, the Option-Pricing Method, and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method in estimating the fair value of our common stock.\nOur board of directors and management developed best estimates based on application of these approaches and the assumptions underlying these valuations, giving careful consideration to the advice from our third-party valuation expert. Such estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation could be materially different.\nDetermination of the fair value of our common stock on grant dates following our IPO\nThe fair value of each share of underlying common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nIn the past, we granted stock options that vest in conjunction with certain performance and market conditions to certain key employees. These awards have two separate market triggers for vesting based upon either (i) the successful achievement of stepped target closing prices on a national securities exchange for 90 consecutive trading days later than 180 days after the Company's initial public offering for its common stock, or (ii) stepped target prices for a change in control transaction. In the event that neither of these market triggers are achieved by the specified timelines, such awards will terminate with respect to that portion of the shares. Expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method and is recognized over the derived service period. We used a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation to value these performance and market contingent stock-based option awards. This valuation methodology utilized the estimated fair value of our common stock on grant date and several key assumptions, including expected volatility of our stock price based on comparable public companies, risk-free rates of return and expected dividend yield.\nStock-based compensation expense was $38.4 million, $18.8 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had $76.2 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nWe have not recognized, and we do not expect to recognize in the near future, any tax benefit related to employee stock-based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 842, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d), applying the optional transition method such that we are not required to adjust prior period presentations. ASU 2016-02 has impacted our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have certain operating lease arrangements for which we are the lessee and one operating lease arrangement for which we are the lessor. We have no financing leases. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. The impact of adoption of the standard is that as of January 1, 2019 we recognized a ROU asset of $46.1 million and operating lease liability of $71.3 million. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statements of Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit), or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe make a determination as to whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We recognize a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) asset and operating lease liability for identified operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments due over the lease term, with the ROU assets adjusted for lease incentives received. When determining the present value of lease payments, we use our incremental borrowing rate ( IBR\u201d) on the date of lease commencement, or the rate implicit in the lease, if known. We do not assume renewals or early terminations in our determination of the lease term unless it is reasonably certain at lease inception to exercise these options.\nWe do not include leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet, unless they include an option to purchase the underlying asset which is reasonably certain of exercise. We recognize lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have leases with lease and non-lease components, which we have elected to account for as a single lease component.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the section titled Selected Financial and Other Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our intentions, plans, objectives, expectations, forecasts and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nOur goal is to discover and develop therapeutics to defeat degeneration.\nOur strategy is guided by three overarching principles that we believe will significantly increase the probability of success and will accelerate the timing to bring effective therapeutics to patients with neurodegenerative diseases:\n\u2022Genetic Pathway Potential: We select our therapeutic targets and disease pathways based on genes that, when mutated, cause, or are major risk factors for, neurodegenerative diseases. We refer to these genes as degenogenes;\n\u2022Engineering Brain Delivery: We engineer our product candidates to cross the blood-brain barrier and act directly in the brain; and\n\u2022Biomarker-Driven Development: We discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to select the right patient population and demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and impact on disease progression of our product candidates.\nWe are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our programs are at different stages of clinical and preclinical development, including five programs in clinical studies.\nWe have also developed a proprietary blood-brain barrier (\"BBB\") platform technology, our transport vehicle (\"TV\"), which enables multiple modality-based platforms to deliver a wide range of large-molecule therapeutics across the BBB, including enzymes, antibodies, proteins and oligonucleotides. This technology is designed to engage specific BBB transport receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed in brain capillaries and facilitate transport of proteins into the brain. We are currently optimizing and broadening this platform technology.\nOur five clinical programs are:\n\u2022our leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (\"LRRK2\") inhibitor program to address Parkinson's disease;\n\u2022our receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (\"RIPK1\") inhibitor program, partnered with Sanofi, to address neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"ALS\");\n\u2022a second RIPK1 inhibitor that our partner Sanofi is developing to address peripheral inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis;\n\u2022our EIF2B activator program to address diseases such as ALS and FTD; and\n\u2022our ETV:IDS program, our most advanced program enabled by our TV technology, which is designed to restore iduronate 2-sulfatase (\"IDS\"), and reduce glycosaminoglycans (\"GAGs\"), both peripherally and in the brain, in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II (\"MPS II\", or \"Hunter syndrome\").\nThe following table summarizes key information about our clinical stage programs:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Program </td> <td> </td> <td>Product Candidate(s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Clinical Phase </td> <td> </td> <td>Indication(s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Operational Control </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LRRK2 </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL201 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1b (complete) </td> <td> </td> <td>Parkinson's disease </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL151 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 and Ph 1b </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIPK1 (CNS) </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL747 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1b </td> <td> </td> <td>Alzheimer's disease </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1b </td> <td> </td> <td>ALS </td> <td> </td> <td>Sanofi </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIPK1 (Peripheral) </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL758 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Systemic inflammatory diseases </td> <td> </td> <td>Sanofi </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EIF2B </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL343 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>ALS and FTD </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ETV:IDS </td> <td> </td> <td>DNL310 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ph 1 (study startup) </td> <td> </td> <td>Hunter syndrome </td> <td> </td> <td>Denali </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo complement our internal capabilities, we have entered into arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, patient-focused data companies, numerous leading academic institutions and foundations to gain access to new product candidates, enable and accelerate the development of our existing programs and deepen our scientific understanding of certain areas of biology. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We currently do not need commercial manufacturing capacity.\nSince we commenced operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to discovering, acquiring and developing product candidates, building our BBB platform technology and assembling our core capabilities in understanding key neurodegenerative disease pathways.\nKey operational and financing milestones for the year ended December 31, 2019 and in 2020 to date include:\n\u2022In February 2019, we received a payment of $5.0 million related to a preclinical milestone earned in December 2018 under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement;\n\u2022In January 2019, we announced, in collaboration with our partner Sanofi, the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL747 in ALS patients, and in February 2019, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL747 in Alzheimer's disease patients;\n\u2022In February 2019, DNL310 (ETV:IDS) was granted orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA;\n\u2022In April 2019, we completed our move to our new headquarters location;\n\u2022In July 2019, our partner Sanofi commenced dosing of our partnered small molecule RIPK1 inhibitor, DNL758, in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers. This triggered a milestone payment of $10.0 million, which was received in August 2019;\n\u2022In September 2019, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL151 in patients with Parkinson's disease, and the launch of our Engage Parkinson's website;\n\u2022In October 2019, we enrolled the first patient in a biomarker study for our ETV:IDS program in Hunter Syndrome. This non-interventional study is expected to yield critical biomarker and clinical data in patients to inform future clinical studies with DNL310 (ETV:IDS) and facilitate patient recruitment into these studies;\n\u2022In November 2019, we announced progress of our DNL747 Phase 1b trials in Alzheimer's disease and ALS, commencement of enrollment of an ALS open label extension in the Netherlands and expansion of sites for the Phase 1b ALS study into the United States. We intend, together with our partner Sanofi, to evaluate the full data set from the ongoing clinical and preclinical studies to inform decisions on further clinical testing for our RIPK1 program. The timing of such decisions is mid-2020;\n\u2022In January 2020, the IND for DNL310 (ETV:IDS) was accepted. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 study for DNL310 in Hunter syndrome patients in the first half of 2020.\n\u2022In January 2020, we announced positive results from our LRRK2 program. Phase 1b results with DNL201 in patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated high levels of target and pathway engagement and improvement of lysosomal biomarkers. Phase 1 results with DNL151 in more than 150 healthy volunteers also met all safety and biomarker goals. We plan to select one of these two molecules for Phase 2/3 studies in patients with and without the LRRK2 mutation in mid-2020.\n\u2022In January 2020, we sold 9.0 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $23.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $194.1 million.\n\u2022In February 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for DNL343 in healthy volunteers.\nWe do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product revenue since our inception. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, the proceeds from our IPO and our follow on offering, and payments received from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $197.6 million, $36.2 million and $88.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $425.6 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we advance our current clinical stage programs through healthy volunteer and patient trials; broaden and improve our BBB platform technology; acquire, discover, validate and develop additional product candidates; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel.\nLicense and Collaboration Agreements\nTakeda\nIn January 2018, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Takeda ( Takeda Collaboration Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option with respect to three of our programs to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, certain biologic products that are enabled by our BBB delivery technology and intended for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The three programs were Denali's ATV:BACE1/Tau, ATV:TREM2 and PTV:PGRN programs. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018 when the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\"HSR\") were satisfied. In February 2019, we amended the Takeda Collaboration Agreement to replace the ATV:BACE1/Tau program with the ATV:Tau program.\nUnder the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Takeda paid us a $40.0 million upfront payment, and is obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $25.0 million with respect to each program under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement directed to a target and based upon the achievement of certain preclinical milestone events, up to $75.0 million in total, of which we have earned and received $15.0 million to date. Takeda is also obligated to pay us a $5.0 million option fee for each target for which Takeda exercises its option, up to $15.0 million in total.\nPursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Takeda in January 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Takeda agreed to purchase, 4,214,559 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $110.0 million. We closed the sale of the 4,214,559 shares of our common stock to Takeda on February 23, 2018.\nAfter Takeda exercises its option for a particular target, we and Takeda will share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, the profits, for each collaboration program. However, for each collaboration program, we may elect not to continue sharing development and commercialization costs, or Takeda may elect to terminate our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations if, following notice from Takeda and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost sharing obligations with respect to the relevant collaboration program. After such an election by us or termination by Takeda becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the relevant collaboration program, and we will not share in any profits from that collaboration program. Instead we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties. The royalty rates will be in the low- to mid-teen percentages on net sales, or low- to high-teen percentages on net sales if we have met a certain co-funding threshold at the time of our election to opt out of co-development or Takeda's termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations, and, in each case, these royalty rates will be subject to certain reductions specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Takeda will pay these royalties to us for each biologic product included in the relevant collaboration program, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant biologic product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that biologic product, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that biologic product in the applicable country, unless biosimilar competition in excess of a significant level specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement occurs earlier, in which case Takeda's royalty obligations in the applicable country would terminate.\nIn addition, if Takeda exercises its option for all three collaboration programs, Takeda may be obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $407.5 million upon achievement of certain clinical milestone events and up to an aggregate of $300.0 million in regulatory milestone events relating to receipt of regulatory approval in the United States, certain European countries and Japan. Takeda may also be obligated to pay us up to $75.0 million per biologic product upon achievement of a certain sales-based milestone, or an aggregate of $225.0 million if one biologic product from each program achieves this milestone.\nWe have recognized collaboration revenue of $5.9 million and $5.7 million associated with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recorded a receivable from Takeda of $5.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We did not have a receivable from Takeda as of December 31, 2019. Through December 31, 2019, we have received $15.0 million in preclinical milestone payments from Takeda and have not recorded any product sales under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.\nSanofi\nIn October 2018, we entered into the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which certain small molecule CNS and peripheral RIPK1 inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and by Denali will be developed and commercialized. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018 when the HSR requirements were satisfied. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi paid us a $125.0 million upfront payment. Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $215.0 million in clinical milestone payments and $385.0 million in regulatory milestone payments for CNS Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") and in Japan for three indications, including Alzheimer's disease. These milestones also include $120.0 million in clinical milestone payments, $175.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and $200.0 million in commercial milestone payments for Peripheral Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the EMA and in Japan for three indications. Through December 31, 2019, we have received milestone payments of $10.0 million under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nDenali will share profits and losses equally with Sanofi for CNS Products sold in the United States and China, and receive royalties on net sales for CNS Products outside of the United States and China and for Peripheral Products sold worldwide, each as further described below. RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and developed and commercialized under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement will be subject to lower milestone and royalty payments to us compared to RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by us. We will also retain responsibility for certain payment obligations under our agreement with an academic institution which licensed certain intellectual property to us that we are sublicensing to Sanofi under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nDenali and Sanofi will jointly develop CNS Products pursuant to a global development plan. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the conduct of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products for Alzheimer's disease and any activities required to support such clinical trials and specific for Alzheimer's disease. We will also conduct, at Sanofi's cost, a Phase 1b trial for DNL747 for ALS. Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for all other Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products, including for multiple sclerosis. Sanofi will lead the conduct of all Phase 3 and later stage development trials for CNS Products, with Sanofi funding 70% of such costs and Denali funding 30% of such costs. We have the ability to opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as further described below.\nSanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for CNS Products. We may elect to conduct certain co-commercialization activities outside of MS with respect to each CNS Product in the United States and/or China, provided that the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for the relevant CNS Product are still in effect, as further described below.\nWe may opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for CNS Products in the United States and China on a CNS Product-by-CNS Product and country-by-country basis. Sanofi may also terminate our cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if, following notice from Sanofi and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost-sharing obligations. After such an opt out by us or termination by Sanofi, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the applicable CNS Products and we will not share in the applicable profits from such CNS Products. Instead, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable CNS Products in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates will be a percentage in the low double digits to mid-teens, but may increase to the mid-teens to low-twenties percentages for all countries in which Sanofi is paying royalties on the applicable CNS products, if we have met certain co-funding thresholds at the time of our election or Sanofi's termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations.\nSanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for conducting activities relating to the development and commercialization of all Peripheral Products. Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for Peripheral Products. We will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid- teen percentages on net sales of Peripheral Products.\nWe have recognized collaboration revenue of $20.8 million and $123.5 million associated with the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recorded a receivable from Sanofi of $1.2 million and $2.3 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Through December 31, 2019, we have received milestone payments of $10.0 million and have not recorded any product sales under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nF-star\nIn August 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (\"F-star Collaboration Agreement\") with F-star Gamma Limited ( F-star Gamma\u201d), F-star Biotechnologische Forschungs-Und Entwicklungsges m.b.H (\"F-star GmbH\") and F-star Biotechnology Limited (\"F-star Ltd\") (collectively, F-star\u201d). The goal of the collaboration is the development of Fcabs to enhance delivery of therapeutics across the BBB into the brain. The collaboration leverages F-star's modular antibody technology and our expertise in the development of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In connection with the entry into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we also purchased an option for an upfront option fee of $0.5 million, or the buy-out option, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma pursuant to a pre-negotiated buy-out option agreement (\"Option Agreement\").\nIn May 2018, we exercised such buy-out option and entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the shareholders of F-star Gamma and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma (the Acquisition\u201d).\nAs a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the entity's name was changed to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, we became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Ltd by way of our assumption of F-star Gamma's license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016, (the F-star Gamma License\u201d). We made initial exercise payments of $18.0 million in aggregate under the Purchase Agreement and the F-star Gamma License, less the net liabilities of F-star Gamma, which were approximately $0.2 million. In addition, we are required to make future contingent payments, to F-star Ltd and the former shareholders of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. These include up to $27.0 million in preclinical contingent payments, $50.0 million in clinical contingent payments, $120.0 million in regulatory contingent payments and $250.0 million in commercial contingent payments. The amount of the contingent payments will vary based on whether F-star delivers an Fcab (constant Fc-domains with antigen-binding activity) that meets pre-defined criteria and whether the Fcab has been identified solely by us or solely by F-star Ltd. or jointly by us and F-star Ltd. In June 2019, we made a payment of $1.5 million to F-star Ltd upon the achievement of a specified preclinical milestone in our ETV:IDS program.\nUnder the terms of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, we could nominate up to three Fcab targets ( Accepted Fcab Targets\u201d) within the first three years of the date of the F-star Collaboration Agreement. Upon entering into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we selected transferrin receptor ( TfR\u201d) as the first Accepted Fcab Target and paid F-star Gamma an upfront fee of $5.5 million, which included selection of the first Accepted Fcab Target. In May 2018, we exercised its right to nominate two additional Fcab Targets and identified a second Accepted Fcab Target. We are obligated to make a one-time payment for the two additional Accepted Fcab Targets of $6.0 million in the aggregate and have extended the time period for our selection of the third Accepted Fcab Target until approximately the fourth anniversary of the date of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, or August 2020.\nWe recognized $1.5 million and $18.3 million of contingent consideration as research and development expense in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A further $6.0 million for the nomination of two additional Accepted Fcab Targets under the F-star Collaboration Agreement was recognized as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, along with the upfront option fee of $0.5 million previously included within other non-current assets. We recognized an additional $1.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million of research and development expense related to the funding of F-star research costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGenentech\nIn June 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Genentech. The agreement gives us access to Genentech's LRRK2 inhibitor program. As consideration to date, we have paid Genentech $12.5 million in the aggregate, including an upfront fee, a technology transfer fee and a clinical milestone payment, all of which was recorded as research and development expense as incurred. No amounts were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. The first clinical milestone payment of $2.5 million was recorded as research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe may owe Genentech milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, up to a maximum of $315.0 million in the aggregate. These milestones include up to $37.5 million in clinical milestone payments, $102.5 million in regulatory milestone payments and $175.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, we may owe royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages, with the exact royalty rate dependent on various factors, including (i) whether the compound incorporated in the relevant licensed product is a Genentech-provided compound or a compound acquired or developed by us, (ii) the date a compound was first discovered, derived or optimized by us, (iii) the existence of patent rights covering the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, (iv) the existence of orphan drug exclusivity covering a licensed product that is a Genentech-provided compound and (v) the level of annual net sales of the relevant licensed product. We also have the right to credit a certain amount of third-party royalty and milestone payments against royalty and milestone payments owed to Genentech, up to a maximum reduction of fifty percent.\nUnless earlier terminated, the agreement with Genentech will continue in effect until all of our royalty and milestone payment obligations to Genentech expire. Following expiration of the agreement, we will retain the licenses under the intellectual property Genentech licensed to us on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis.\nComponents of Operating Results\nCollaboration Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. All revenue recognized to date has been collaboration revenue from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi.\nIn the future, we will continue to recognize revenue from the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement and may generate revenue from product sales or milestones, royalties and cost reimbursement from other collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We expect that our revenue will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, milestones, reimbursement of costs incurred and other payments and product sales, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We record research and development expenses as incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and BBB platform technology include:\n\u2022 external research and development expenses, including:\n\u2022expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), preclinical testing organizations, contract development and manufacturing organizations (\"CDMOs\"), academic and non-profit institutions and consultants;\n\u2022expenses to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use;\n\u2022fees related to our license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.\nA portion of our research and development expenses are direct external expenses, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced late-stage IND-enabling studies.\nProgram expenses include expenses associated with our most advanced product candidates and the discovery and development of backup or next-generation molecules. We also track external expenses associated with our BBB platform technology. These expenses include those incurred by us relating to our Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. All external costs associated with earlier stage programs, or that benefit the entire portfolio, are tracked as a group. We do not track personnel or other operating expenses incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, facility expenses including rent and depreciation, and lab consumables.\nIt is challenging to predict the nature, timing and estimated long-range costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022our ability to add and retain key research and development personnel;\n\u2022our ability to establish an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;\n\u2022our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates;\n\u2022our successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations;\n\u2022our ability to discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and the impact on disease progression of our molecules;\n\u2022our ability to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;\n\u2022the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates if and when approved;\n\u2022our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022the continued acceptable safety profiles of the product candidates following approval.\nA change in any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We expect our research and development expenses to increase at least over the next several years as we continue to implement our business strategy, advance our current programs, expand our research and development efforts, seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, access and develop additional product candidates and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include personnel-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, expenses for outside professional services and allocated expenses. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent, depreciation and other expenses related to our office and research and development facility not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe expect to continue to incur certain expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase our administrative headcount as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, which will also increase our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and investment income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, gains and losses on foreign currency hedges, and sublease income.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(102,482) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79) </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>193,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>46,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>239,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(213,184) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,370) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166,812) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income, net </td> <td>15,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(197,965) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(161,725) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(197,614) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(161,374) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>445 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration revenue. Collaboration revenue was $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $129.2 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $102.5 million was primarily due to a decrease of $102.7 million of revenue recognized under our Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in 2019.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program and category (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LRRK2 program external expenses\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIPK1 program external expenses\n</td> <td>12,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EIF2B program external expenses </td> <td>5,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ETV:IDS program external expenses </td> <td>14,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other BBB program external expenses </td> <td>14,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB platform external expenses\n</td> <td>1,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,043) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other external research and development expenses\n</td> <td>17,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related expenses(1)\n</td> <td>62,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unallocated research and development expenses\n</td> <td>32,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________________\n(1)Personnel-related expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $19.3 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting an increase of $9.2 million.\nThere was an increase in total research and development expenses of $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This reflects increases in external expenses related to progression of our portfolio, including the following: (i) an increase of $19.3 million in the LRRK2 program; (ii) an increase of $9.7 million in the ETV:IDS program; (iii) an increase of $8.9 million in other BBB delivery platform programs; (iv) an increase of $2.9 million in the EIF2B program; and (v) an increase of $8.8 million in other external research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in RIPK1 program external expenses. Further, there was a $20.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, consisting of a $11.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses attributable to an increase in our research and development headcount, and a $9.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily attributable to additional equity award grants and certain performance and market-based awards. There was also a $9.1 million increase in other unallocated research and development expenses, which was primarily due to an increase in facilities-related expenses of $5.4 million resulting from increased rent expense associated with the new headquarters lease, a $2.5 million increase in lab consumable expenses, and a $1.2 million increase in other general costs, such as travel and IT related expenses attributable to our research and development departments. These increases were partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in BBB platform external expense, the majority of which related to expenses incurred in 2018 associated with the acquisition of F-star Gamma Limited, and the nomination of two additional Fcab targets under the F-star Collaboration Agreement, both of which occurred in May 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $14.1 million was primarily attributable to the $12.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, driven by higher general and administrative headcount and stock-based compensation expense associated with additional equity award grants and certain performance and market-based awards. Additionally, there was a $1.0 million increase in facilities related expenses, including increased rent expense associated with the new headquarters lease and a $1.3 million increase in other general costs, such as travel, insurance, taxes and IT related expenses attributable to our general and administrative departments. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in legal and other professional service expenses.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $5.1 million reflects higher interest income due to a higher average cash balance in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Further, we received $2.6 million of sublease income in the year ended December 31, 2019 but no sublease income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit. Income tax benefit was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the tax benefit associated with an unrealized gain on marketable securities in other comprehensive income. There was no income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations\u201d in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, proceeds from our IPO, our follow on offering, and payments received from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi. On December 7, 2017, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued 15,972,221 shares of our common stock, including 2,083,333 shares sold pursuant the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $18.00 per share. We received $264.3 million from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses incurred by us.\nPursuant to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we have received $55.0 million related to upfront and milestone payments through December 31, 2019. Further, under the associated Purchase Agreement we received $110.0 million in February 2018 for the sale and issuance of 4,214,559 shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $125.0 million in November 2018, and a milestone payment of $10.0 million in August 2019, which was triggered by the commencement of a DNL758 Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. We have received further payments of $11.6 million for performance of Retained Activities through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amount of $455.2 million.\nIn January 2020, we sold 9.0 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $23.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately$194.1 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we expand our research and development activities and continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. Further, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur additional costs associated with supporting our growing operations. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates or from our existing collaboration agreements, or future agreements with other third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Additionally, any future collaborations we enter into with third parties may provide capital in the near term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of $425.6 million through December 31, 2019. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we conduct and expand our research and development activities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u2022the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\u2022the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we have entered into license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new research and development, license or collaboration arrangements;\n\u2022our ability and success in securing manufacturing relationships with third parties or, in the future, in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility;\n\u2022the costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;\n\u2022the cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022our efforts to enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022the costs and ongoing investments to in-license and/or acquire additional technologies.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(151,576) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(76,635) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>147,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(287,422) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,166) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>6,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>296,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(140,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $151.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $197.6 million, adjusted by non-cash items primarily related to stock-based compensation, depreciation, and non-cash rent expenses, partially offset by net amortization of discounts on marketable securities. Cash used in operating activities was also driven by changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $147.7 million, which consisted of $535.3 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities, partially offset by $369.7 million of purchases of marketable securities and $17.9 million of capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 million, which consisted entirely of proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock and issuance of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") shares.\nYears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma, our F-star Collaboration Agreement represented a variable interest in a variable interest entity, or VIE, F-star Gamma. However, we did not consolidate F-star Gamma in our consolidated financial statements because we had determined that we were not considered to be its primary beneficiary.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations under license and other contractual agreements (2)\n</td> <td>12,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________________\n(1)Represents future minimum lease payments under our headquarters lease. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes.\n(2)Represents non-cancellable fees due in connection with license and other contractual agreements, including those under the Lonza DMSA.\n(3)We enter into contracts in the normal course of business, primarily with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials, or for other services or supplies related to research and development activities. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and no arrangements include material stipulated commitment payments.\nIn May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our operating lease for our former corporate headquarters in South San Francisco (the \"Headquarters Lease Amendment\") to relocate and expand our headquarters to 148,020 rentable square feet in a building in South San Francisco, California (the \"New Premises\"). The Headquarters Lease Amendment has a contractual term of ten years from the legal commencement date, which was April 1, 2019 when the building was ready for occupancy. For accounting purposes, the lease commencement date was determined to be August 1, 2018, which was the date at which we were deemed to have obtained control over the property. We have an option to extend the lease term for a period of ten years by giving the landlord written notice of the election to exercise the option at least nine months, but not more than twelve months, prior to the expiration of the Headquarters Lease Amendment lease term. We determined that this renewal was not reasonably certain at lease inception.\nThe Headquarters Lease Amendment provides for monthly base rent amounts escalating over the term of the lease. In addition, the Headquarters Lease Amendment provided a tenant improvement allowance (\"TIA\") of up to $25.9 million, which was fully utilized, of which $4.4 million will be repaid to the landlord in the form of additional monthly rent. This is recorded as leasehold improvement assets and an offset to the lease ROU asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. We are also required to pay the operating expenses for the New Premises, such as taxes and insurance, which are treated as variable lease payments.\nEffective September 2017, we entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement as amended (\"DMSA\") with Lonza Sales AG (\"Lonza\") for the development and manufacture of biologic products. Under the DMSA, we will execute purchase orders based on project plans authorizing Lonza to provide development and manufacturing services with respect to certain of our antibody and enzyme products, and will pay for the services provided and batches delivered in accordance with the DMSA and project plan. Unless earlier terminated, the DMSA will expire on September 6, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had open non-cancellable purchase orders for biological product development and manufacturing costs totaling $21.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively. The activities under these purchase orders are expected to be completed by November 2024. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total non-refundable purchase commitments of $11.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, under the DMSA.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred costs of $12.7 million and $3.9 million, and made payments of $12.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA. We had not incurred any costs or made any payments for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPursuant to certain license agreements, including our agreement with Genentech, we have obligations to make future milestone and royalty payments to other parties. Additionally, we have certain contingent payments to F-star and former shareholders of F-star Gamma related to the acquisition of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate. However, we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones and, therefore, any related payments are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nLicense and Collaboration Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), using a full retrospective application. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09 as we had not recognized any revenue through December 31, 2017. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as collaboration arrangements and leases.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, within the scope of Topic 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. The accounting treatment pursuant to Topic 606 is outlined below.\nThe terms of licensing and collaboration agreements entered into typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply and research and development services; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments results in license, collaboration and other revenue, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenue. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.\nWe record amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the related performance obligation is expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months this will be classified in current liabilities. Amounts recognized as revenue prior to the Company having an unconditional right (other than a right that is conditioned only on the passage of time) to receipt are recorded as contract assets in our consolidated balance sheets. If we expect to have an unconditional right to receive the consideration in the next twelve months, this will be classified in current assets. A net contract asset or liability is presented for each contract with a customer.\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and identify those distinct goods and services that represent a performance obligation. A promised good or service may not be identified as a performance obligation if it is immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer, if it is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (either because it is not capable of being separated or because it is not separable in the context of the contract), or if the performance obligation does not provide the customer with a material right.\nWe consider the terms of the contract to determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. Variable consideration will only be included in the transaction price when it is not considered constrained, which is when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nIf it is determined that multiple performance obligations exist, the transaction price is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling prices (\"SSP\"). The relative SSP for each deliverable is estimated using external sourced evidence if it is available. If external sourced evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the SSP for the deliverable.\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset, which for a service is considered to be as the services are received and used. We recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward our complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\nAfter contract inception, the transaction price is reassessed at every period end and updated for changes such as resolution of uncertain events. Any change in the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations on the same basis as at contract inception.\nWe may be required to exercise considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized. Judgment is required in identifying performance obligations, estimating the transaction price, estimating the SSP of identified performance obligations, which may include forecasted revenue, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success, and estimating the progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe record research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and the development of our BBB platform technology and include: employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash stock-based compensation expense; external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, preclinical testing organizations, CDMOs, academic and non-profit institutions and consultants; costs to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use; license fees; and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.\nAs part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses. A portion of our research and development expenses are external costs, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced a late-stage IND-enabling study. We record the estimated expenses of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers based upon the estimated amount of services provided within research and development expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These services include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, contract manufacturing activities and consulting services. If the costs have been prepaid, this expense reduces the prepaid expenses in the balance sheet, and if not yet invoiced, the costs are included in accrued liabilities in the balance sheet. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We record amortization of prepaid expenses or accrued expenses for these costs based on the estimated amount of work completed and in accordance with agreements established with these third parties.\nCosts for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from external clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. To date, we have not experienced material differences between our accrued expenses and actual expenses. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and shares issued under its employee stock purchase plan to our employees, certain non-employee consultants and certain members of our board of directors. We measure stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options granted to our employees and directors on the date of grant. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2018-07, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting on September 30, 2018, future stock-based compensation expense for non-employee stock-based awards is measured based on the fair value on the date of adoption. We recognize the corresponding compensation expense of awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, and we adjust for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to our employees and directors and rights to acquire stock granted under our ESPP, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We use the fair value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\n\u2022Expected Term. Our expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term), as we do not have sufficient historical data to use any other method to estimate expected term.\n\u2022Expected Volatility. As we have very limited trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock option grants.\n\u2022Expected Dividend. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nDetermination of the estimated fair value of our common stock on grant dates prior to our IPO\nAs there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.\nWe periodically determined the estimated fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (\"Practice Aid\"). In accordance with the Practice Aid, our board of directors considered the Current Value Method, the Option-Pricing Method, and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method in estimating the fair value of our common stock.\nOur board of directors and management developed best estimates based on application of these approaches and the assumptions underlying these valuations, giving careful consideration to the advice from our third-party valuation expert. Such estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation could be materially different.\nDetermination of the fair value of our common stock on grant dates following our IPO\nThe fair value of each share of underlying common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nIn the past, we granted stock options that vest in conjunction with certain performance and market conditions to certain key employees. These awards have two separate market triggers for vesting based upon either (i) the successful achievement of stepped target closing prices on a national securities exchange for 90 consecutive trading days later than 180 days after the Company's initial public offering for its common stock, or (ii) stepped target prices for a change in control transaction. In the event that neither of these market triggers are achieved by the specified timelines, such awards will terminate with respect to that portion of the shares. Expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method and is recognized over the derived service period. We used a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation to value these performance and market contingent stock-based option awards. This valuation methodology utilized the estimated fair value of our common stock on grant date and several key assumptions, including expected volatility of our stock price based on comparable public companies, risk-free rates of return and expected dividend yield.\nStock-based compensation expense was $38.4 million, $18.8 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had $76.2 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nWe have not recognized, and we do not expect to recognize in the near future, any tax benefit related to employee stock-based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 842, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d), applying the optional transition method such that we are not required to adjust prior period presentations. ASU 2016-02 has impacted our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have certain operating lease arrangements for which we are the lessee and one operating lease arrangement for which we are the lessor. We have no financing leases. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. The impact of adoption of the standard is that as of January 1, 2019 we recognized a ROU asset of $46.1 million and operating lease liability of $71.3 million. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statements of Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit), or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe make a determination as to whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We recognize a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) asset and operating lease liability for identified operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments due over the lease term, with the ROU assets adjusted for lease incentives received. When determining the present value of lease payments, we use our incremental borrowing rate ( IBR\u201d) on the date of lease commencement, or the rate implicit in the lease, if known. We do not assume renewals or early terminations in our determination of the lease term unless it is reasonably certain at lease inception to exercise these options.\nWe do not include leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet, unless they include an option to purchase the underlying asset which is reasonably certain of exercise. We recognize lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have leases with lease and non-lease components, which we have elected to account for as a single lease component.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the section titled Selected Financial and Other Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our intentions, plans, objectives, expectations, forecasts and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nOur goal is to discover and develop therapeutics to defeat degeneration.\nOur strategy is guided by three overarching principles that we believe will significantly increase the probability of success and will accelerate the timing to bring effective therapeutics to patients with neurodegenerative diseases:\n\u2022Genetic Pathway Potential: We select our therapeutic targets and disease pathways based on genes that, when mutated, cause, or are major risk factors for, neurodegenerative diseases. We refer to these genes as degenogenes;\n\u2022Engineering Brain Delivery: We engineer our product candidates to cross the blood-brain barrier and act directly in the brain; and\n\u2022Biomarker-Driven Development: We discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to select the right patient population and demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and impact on disease progression of our product candidates.\nWe are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our programs are at different stages of clinical and preclinical development, including five programs in clinical studies.\nWe have also developed a proprietary blood-brain barrier (\"BBB\") platform technology, our transport vehicle (\"TV\"), which enables multiple modality-based platforms to deliver a wide range of large-molecule therapeutics across the BBB, including enzymes, antibodies, proteins and oligonucleotides. This technology is designed to engage specific BBB transport receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed in brain capillaries and facilitate transport of proteins into the brain. We are currently optimizing and broadening this platform technology.\nOur five clinical programs are:\n\u2022our leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (\"LRRK2\") inhibitor program to address Parkinson's disease;\n\u2022our receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (\"RIPK1\") inhibitor program, partnered with Sanofi, to address neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"ALS\");\n\u2022a second RIPK1 inhibitor that our partner Sanofi is developing to address peripheral inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis;\n\u2022our EIF2B activator program to address diseases such as ALS and FTD; and\n\u2022our ETV:IDS program, our most advanced program enabled by our TV technology, which is designed to restore iduronate 2-sulfatase (\"IDS\"), and reduce glycosaminoglycans (\"GAGs\"), both peripherally and in the brain, in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II (\"MPS II\", or \"Hunter syndrome\").\nThe following table summarizes key information about our clinical stage programs:\n\nTo complement our internal capabilities, we have entered into arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, patient-focused data companies, numerous leading academic institutions and foundations to gain access to new product candidates, enable and accelerate the development of our existing programs and deepen our scientific understanding of certain areas of biology. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We currently do not need commercial manufacturing capacity.\nSince we commenced operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to discovering, acquiring and developing product candidates, building our BBB platform technology and assembling our core capabilities in understanding key neurodegenerative disease pathways.\nKey operational and financing milestones for the year ended December 31, 2019 and in 2020 to date include:\n\u2022In February 2019, we received a payment of $5.0 million related to a preclinical milestone earned in December 2018 under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement;\n\u2022In January 2019, we announced, in collaboration with our partner Sanofi, the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL747 in ALS patients, and in February 2019, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL747 in Alzheimer's disease patients;\n\u2022In February 2019, DNL310 (ETV:IDS) was granted orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA;\n\u2022In April 2019, we completed our move to our new headquarters location;\n\u2022In July 2019, our partner Sanofi commenced dosing of our partnered small molecule RIPK1 inhibitor, DNL758, in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers. This triggered a milestone payment of $10.0 million, which was received in August 2019;\n\u2022In September 2019, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 1b study of DNL151 in patients with Parkinson's disease, and the launch of our Engage Parkinson's website;\n\u2022In October 2019, we enrolled the first patient in a biomarker study for our ETV:IDS program in Hunter Syndrome. This non-interventional study is expected to yield critical biomarker and clinical data in patients to inform future clinical studies with DNL310 (ETV:IDS) and facilitate patient recruitment into these studies;\n\u2022In November 2019, we announced progress of our DNL747 Phase 1b trials in Alzheimer's disease and ALS, commencement of enrollment of an ALS open label extension in the Netherlands and expansion of sites for the Phase 1b ALS study into the United States. We intend, together with our partner Sanofi, to evaluate the full data set from the ongoing clinical and preclinical studies to inform decisions on further clinical testing for our RIPK1 program. The timing of such decisions is mid-2020;\n\u2022In January 2020, the IND for DNL310 (ETV:IDS) was accepted. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 study for DNL310 in Hunter syndrome patients in the first half of 2020.\n\u2022In January 2020, we announced positive results from our LRRK2 program. Phase 1b results with DNL201 in patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated high levels of target and pathway engagement and improvement of lysosomal biomarkers. Phase 1 results with DNL151 in more than 150 healthy volunteers also met all safety and biomarker goals. We plan to select one of these two molecules for Phase 2/3 studies in patients with and without the LRRK2 mutation in mid-2020.\n\u2022In January 2020, we sold 9.0 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $23.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $194.1 million.\n\u2022In February 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for DNL343 in healthy volunteers.\nWe do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product revenue since our inception. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, the proceeds from our IPO and our follow on offering, and payments received from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $197.6 million, $36.2 million and $88.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $425.6 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we advance our current clinical stage programs through healthy volunteer and patient trials; broaden and improve our BBB platform technology; acquire, discover, validate and develop additional product candidates; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel.\nLicense and Collaboration Agreements\nTakeda\nIn January 2018, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Takeda ( Takeda Collaboration Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option with respect to three of our programs to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, certain biologic products that are enabled by our BBB delivery technology and intended for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The three programs were Denali's ATV:BACE1/Tau, ATV:TREM2 and PTV:PGRN programs. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018 when the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\"HSR\") were satisfied. In February 2019, we amended the Takeda Collaboration Agreement to replace the ATV:BACE1/Tau program with the ATV:Tau program.\nUnder the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Takeda paid us a $40.0 million upfront payment, and is obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $25.0 million with respect to each program under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement directed to a target and based upon the achievement of certain preclinical milestone events, up to $75.0 million in total, of which we have earned and received $15.0 million to date. Takeda is also obligated to pay us a $5.0 million option fee for each target for which Takeda exercises its option, up to $15.0 million in total.\nPursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Takeda in January 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Takeda agreed to purchase, 4,214,559 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $110.0 million. We closed the sale of the 4,214,559 shares of our common stock to Takeda on February 23, 2018.\nAfter Takeda exercises its option for a particular target, we and Takeda will share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, the profits, for each collaboration program. However, for each collaboration program, we may elect not to continue sharing development and commercialization costs, or Takeda may elect to terminate our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations if, following notice from Takeda and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost sharing obligations with respect to the relevant collaboration program. After such an election by us or termination by Takeda becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the relevant collaboration program, and we will not share in any profits from that collaboration program. Instead we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties. The royalty rates will be in the low- to mid-teen percentages on net sales, or low- to high-teen percentages on net sales if we have met a certain co-funding threshold at the time of our election to opt out of co-development or Takeda's termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations, and, in each case, these royalty rates will be subject to certain reductions specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Takeda will pay these royalties to us for each biologic product included in the relevant collaboration program, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant biologic product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that biologic product, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that biologic product in the applicable country, unless biosimilar competition in excess of a significant level specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement occurs earlier, in which case Takeda's royalty obligations in the applicable country would terminate.\nIn addition, if Takeda exercises its option for all three collaboration programs, Takeda may be obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $407.5 million upon achievement of certain clinical milestone events and up to an aggregate of $300.0 million in regulatory milestone events relating to receipt of regulatory approval in the United States, certain European countries and Japan. Takeda may also be obligated to pay us up to $75.0 million per biologic product upon achievement of a certain sales-based milestone, or an aggregate of $225.0 million if one biologic product from each program achieves this milestone.\nWe have recognized collaboration revenue of $5.9 million and $5.7 million associated with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recorded a receivable from Takeda of $5.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We did not have a receivable from Takeda as of December 31, 2019. Through December 31, 2019, we have received $15.0 million in preclinical milestone payments from Takeda and have not recorded any product sales under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.\nSanofi\nIn October 2018, we entered into the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which certain small molecule CNS and peripheral RIPK1 inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and by Denali will be developed and commercialized. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018 when the HSR requirements were satisfied. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi paid us a $125.0 million upfront payment. Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $215.0 million in clinical milestone payments and $385.0 million in regulatory milestone payments for CNS Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") and in Japan for three indications, including Alzheimer's disease. These milestones also include $120.0 million in clinical milestone payments, $175.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and $200.0 million in commercial milestone payments for Peripheral Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the EMA and in Japan for three indications. Through December 31, 2019, we have received milestone payments of $10.0 million under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nDenali will share profits and losses equally with Sanofi for CNS Products sold in the United States and China, and receive royalties on net sales for CNS Products outside of the United States and China and for Peripheral Products sold worldwide, each as further described below. RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and developed and commercialized under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement will be subject to lower milestone and royalty payments to us compared to RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by us. We will also retain responsibility for certain payment obligations under our agreement with an academic institution which licensed certain intellectual property to us that we are sublicensing to Sanofi under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nDenali and Sanofi will jointly develop CNS Products pursuant to a global development plan. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the conduct of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products for Alzheimer's disease and any activities required to support such clinical trials and specific for Alzheimer's disease. We will also conduct, at Sanofi's cost, a Phase 1b trial for DNL747 for ALS. Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for all other Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products, including for multiple sclerosis. Sanofi will lead the conduct of all Phase 3 and later stage development trials for CNS Products, with Sanofi funding 70% of such costs and Denali funding 30% of such costs. We have the ability to opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as further described below.\nSanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for CNS Products. We may elect to conduct certain co-commercialization activities outside of MS with respect to each CNS Product in the United States and/or China, provided that the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for the relevant CNS Product are still in effect, as further described below.\nWe may opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for CNS Products in the United States and China on a CNS Product-by-CNS Product and country-by-country basis. Sanofi may also terminate our cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if, following notice from Sanofi and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost-sharing obligations. After such an opt out by us or termination by Sanofi, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the applicable CNS Products and we will not share in the applicable profits from such CNS Products. Instead, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable CNS Products in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates will be a percentage in the low double digits to mid-teens, but may increase to the mid-teens to low-twenties percentages for all countries in which Sanofi is paying royalties on the applicable CNS products, if we have met certain co-funding thresholds at the time of our election or Sanofi's termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations.\nSanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for conducting activities relating to the development and commercialization of all Peripheral Products. Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for Peripheral Products. We will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid- teen percentages on net sales of Peripheral Products.\nWe have recognized collaboration revenue of $20.8 million and $123.5 million associated with the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recorded a receivable from Sanofi of $1.2 million and $2.3 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Through December 31, 2019, we have received milestone payments of $10.0 million and have not recorded any product sales under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.\nF-star\nIn August 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (\"F-star Collaboration Agreement\") with F-star Gamma Limited ( F-star Gamma\u201d), F-star Biotechnologische Forschungs-Und Entwicklungsges m.b.H (\"F-star GmbH\") and F-star Biotechnology Limited (\"F-star Ltd\") (collectively, F-star\u201d). The goal of the collaboration is the development of Fcabs to enhance delivery of therapeutics across the BBB into the brain. The collaboration leverages F-star's modular antibody technology and our expertise in the development of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In connection with the entry into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we also purchased an option for an upfront option fee of $0.5 million, or the buy-out option, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma pursuant to a pre-negotiated buy-out option agreement (\"Option Agreement\").\nIn May 2018, we exercised such buy-out option and entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the shareholders of F-star Gamma and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma (the Acquisition\u201d).\nAs a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the entity's name was changed to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, we became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Ltd by way of our assumption of F-star Gamma's license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016, (the F-star Gamma License\u201d). We made initial exercise payments of $18.0 million in aggregate under the Purchase Agreement and the F-star Gamma License, less the net liabilities of F-star Gamma, which were approximately $0.2 million. In addition, we are required to make future contingent payments, to F-star Ltd and the former shareholders of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. These include up to $27.0 million in preclinical contingent payments, $50.0 million in clinical contingent payments, $120.0 million in regulatory contingent payments and $250.0 million in commercial contingent payments. The amount of the contingent payments will vary based on whether F-star delivers an Fcab (constant Fc-domains with antigen-binding activity) that meets pre-defined criteria and whether the Fcab has been identified solely by us or solely by F-star Ltd. or jointly by us and F-star Ltd. In June 2019, we made a payment of $1.5 million to F-star Ltd upon the achievement of a specified preclinical milestone in our ETV:IDS program.\nUnder the terms of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, we could nominate up to three Fcab targets ( Accepted Fcab Targets\u201d) within the first three years of the date of the F-star Collaboration Agreement. Upon entering into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we selected transferrin receptor ( TfR\u201d) as the first Accepted Fcab Target and paid F-star Gamma an upfront fee of $5.5 million, which included selection of the first Accepted Fcab Target. In May 2018, we exercised its right to nominate two additional Fcab Targets and identified a second Accepted Fcab Target. We are obligated to make a one-time payment for the two additional Accepted Fcab Targets of $6.0 million in the aggregate and have extended the time period for our selection of the third Accepted Fcab Target until approximately the fourth anniversary of the date of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, or August 2020.\nWe recognized $1.5 million and $18.3 million of contingent consideration as research and development expense in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A further $6.0 million for the nomination of two additional Accepted Fcab Targets under the F-star Collaboration Agreement was recognized as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, along with the upfront option fee of $0.5 million previously included within other non-current assets. We recognized an additional $1.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million of research and development expense related to the funding of F-star research costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGenentech\nIn June 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Genentech. The agreement gives us access to Genentech's LRRK2 inhibitor program. As consideration to date, we have paid Genentech $12.5 million in the aggregate, including an upfront fee, a technology transfer fee and a clinical milestone payment, all of which was recorded as research and development expense as incurred. No amounts were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. The first clinical milestone payment of $2.5 million was recorded as research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe may owe Genentech milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, up to a maximum of $315.0 million in the aggregate. These milestones include up to $37.5 million in clinical milestone payments, $102.5 million in regulatory milestone payments and $175.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, we may owe royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages, with the exact royalty rate dependent on various factors, including (i) whether the compound incorporated in the relevant licensed product is a Genentech-provided compound or a compound acquired or developed by us, (ii) the date a compound was first discovered, derived or optimized by us, (iii) the existence of patent rights covering the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, (iv) the existence of orphan drug exclusivity covering a licensed product that is a Genentech-provided compound and (v) the level of annual net sales of the relevant licensed product. We also have the right to credit a certain amount of third-party royalty and milestone payments against royalty and milestone payments owed to Genentech, up to a maximum reduction of fifty percent.\nUnless earlier terminated, the agreement with Genentech will continue in effect until all of our royalty and milestone payment obligations to Genentech expire. Following expiration of the agreement, we will retain the licenses under the intellectual property Genentech licensed to us on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis.\nComponents of Operating Results\nCollaboration Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. All revenue recognized to date has been collaboration revenue from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi.\nIn the future, we will continue to recognize revenue from the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement and may generate revenue from product sales or milestones, royalties and cost reimbursement from other collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We expect that our revenue will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, milestones, reimbursement of costs incurred and other payments and product sales, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We record research and development expenses as incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and BBB platform technology include:\n\u2022 external research and development expenses, including:\n\u2022expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), preclinical testing organizations, contract development and manufacturing organizations (\"CDMOs\"), academic and non-profit institutions and consultants;\n\u2022expenses to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use;\n\u2022fees related to our license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.\nA portion of our research and development expenses are direct external expenses, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced late-stage IND-enabling studies.\nProgram expenses include expenses associated with our most advanced product candidates and the discovery and development of backup or next-generation molecules. We also track external expenses associated with our BBB platform technology. These expenses include those incurred by us relating to our Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. All external costs associated with earlier stage programs, or that benefit the entire portfolio, are tracked as a group. We do not track personnel or other operating expenses incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, facility expenses including rent and depreciation, and lab consumables.\nIt is challenging to predict the nature, timing and estimated long-range costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022our ability to add and retain key research and development personnel;\n\u2022our ability to establish an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;\n\u2022our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates;\n\u2022our successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations;\n\u2022our ability to discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and the impact on disease progression of our molecules;\n\u2022our ability to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;\n\u2022the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates if and when approved;\n\u2022our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022the continued acceptable safety profiles of the product candidates following approval.\nA change in any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We expect our research and development expenses to increase at least over the next several years as we continue to implement our business strategy, advance our current programs, expand our research and development efforts, seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, access and develop additional product candidates and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include personnel-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, expenses for outside professional services and allocated expenses. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent, depreciation and other expenses related to our office and research and development facility not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe expect to continue to incur certain expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase our administrative headcount as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, which will also increase our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and investment income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, gains and losses on foreign currency hedges, and sublease income.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations (in thousands):\n\nCollaboration revenue. Collaboration revenue was $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $129.2 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $102.5 million was primarily due to a decrease of $102.7 million of revenue recognized under our Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in 2019.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $143.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program and category (in thousands):\n\n__________________________________________________\n(1)Personnel-related expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $19.3 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting an increase of $9.2 million.\nThere was an increase in total research and development expenses of $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This reflects increases in external expenses related to progression of our portfolio, including the following: (i) an increase of $19.3 million in the LRRK2 program; (ii) an increase of $9.7 million in the ETV:IDS program; (iii) an increase of $8.9 million in other BBB delivery platform programs; (iv) an increase of $2.9 million in the EIF2B program; and (v) an increase of $8.8 million in other external research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in RIPK1 program external expenses. Further, there was a $20.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, consisting of a $11.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses attributable to an increase in our research and development headcount, and a $9.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily attributable to additional equity award grants and certain performance and market-based awards. There was also a $9.1 million increase in other unallocated research and development expenses, which was primarily due to an increase in facilities-related expenses of $5.4 million resulting from increased rent expense associated with the new headquarters lease, a $2.5 million increase in lab consumable expenses, and a $1.2 million increase in other general costs, such as travel and IT related expenses attributable to our research and development departments. These increases were partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in BBB platform external expense, the majority of which related to expenses incurred in 2018 associated with the acquisition of F-star Gamma Limited, and the nomination of two additional Fcab targets under the F-star Collaboration Agreement, both of which occurred in May 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $14.1 million was primarily attributable to the $12.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, driven by higher general and administrative headcount and stock-based compensation expense associated with additional equity award grants and certain performance and market-based awards. Additionally, there was a $1.0 million increase in facilities related expenses, including increased rent expense associated with the new headquarters lease and a $1.3 million increase in other general costs, such as travel, insurance, taxes and IT related expenses attributable to our general and administrative departments. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in legal and other professional service expenses.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $5.1 million reflects higher interest income due to a higher average cash balance in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Further, we received $2.6 million of sublease income in the year ended December 31, 2019 but no sublease income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome tax benefit. Income tax benefit was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the tax benefit associated with an unrealized gain on marketable securities in other comprehensive income. There was no income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations\u201d in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, proceeds from our IPO, our follow on offering, and payments received from our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Sanofi. On December 7, 2017, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued 15,972,221 shares of our common stock, including 2,083,333 shares sold pursuant the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $18.00 per share. We received $264.3 million from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses incurred by us.\nPursuant to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we have received $55.0 million related to upfront and milestone payments through December 31, 2019. Further, under the associated Purchase Agreement we received $110.0 million in February 2018 for the sale and issuance of 4,214,559 shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $125.0 million in November 2018, and a milestone payment of $10.0 million in August 2019, which was triggered by the commencement of a DNL758 Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. We have received further payments of $11.6 million for performance of Retained Activities through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amount of $455.2 million.\nIn January 2020, we sold 9.0 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $23.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately$194.1 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we expand our research and development activities and continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. Further, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur additional costs associated with supporting our growing operations. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates or from our existing collaboration agreements, or future agreements with other third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Additionally, any future collaborations we enter into with third parties may provide capital in the near term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of $425.6 million through December 31, 2019. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we conduct and expand our research and development activities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u2022the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\u2022the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we have entered into license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new research and development, license or collaboration arrangements;\n\u2022our ability and success in securing manufacturing relationships with third parties or, in the future, in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility;\n\u2022the costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;\n\u2022the cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022our efforts to enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022the costs and ongoing investments to in-license and/or acquire additional technologies.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):\n\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $151.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $197.6 million, adjusted by non-cash items primarily related to stock-based compensation, depreciation, and non-cash rent expenses, partially offset by net amortization of discounts on marketable securities. Cash used in operating activities was also driven by changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $147.7 million, which consisted of $535.3 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities, partially offset by $369.7 million of purchases of marketable securities and $17.9 million of capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 million, which consisted entirely of proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock and issuance of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") shares.\nYears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma, our F-star Collaboration Agreement represented a variable interest in a variable interest entity, or VIE, F-star Gamma. However, we did not consolidate F-star Gamma in our consolidated financial statements because we had determined that we were not considered to be its primary beneficiary.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\n__________________________________________________\n(1)Represents future minimum lease payments under our headquarters lease. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes.\n(2)Represents non-cancellable fees due in connection with license and other contractual agreements, including those under the Lonza DMSA.\n(3)We enter into contracts in the normal course of business, primarily with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials, or for other services or supplies related to research and development activities. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and no arrangements include material stipulated commitment payments.\nIn May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our operating lease for our former corporate headquarters in South San Francisco (the \"Headquarters Lease Amendment\") to relocate and expand our headquarters to 148,020 rentable square feet in a building in South San Francisco, California (the \"New Premises\"). The Headquarters Lease Amendment has a contractual term of ten years from the legal commencement date, which was April 1, 2019 when the building was ready for occupancy. For accounting purposes, the lease commencement date was determined to be August 1, 2018, which was the date at which we were deemed to have obtained control over the property. We have an option to extend the lease term for a period of ten years by giving the landlord written notice of the election to exercise the option at least nine months, but not more than twelve months, prior to the expiration of the Headquarters Lease Amendment lease term. We determined that this renewal was not reasonably certain at lease inception.\nThe Headquarters Lease Amendment provides for monthly base rent amounts escalating over the term of the lease. In addition, the Headquarters Lease Amendment provided a tenant improvement allowance (\"TIA\") of up to $25.9 million, which was fully utilized, of which $4.4 million will be repaid to the landlord in the form of additional monthly rent. This is recorded as leasehold improvement assets and an offset to the lease ROU asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. We are also required to pay the operating expenses for the New Premises, such as taxes and insurance, which are treated as variable lease payments.\nEffective September 2017, we entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement as amended (\"DMSA\") with Lonza Sales AG (\"Lonza\") for the development and manufacture of biologic products. Under the DMSA, we will execute purchase orders based on project plans authorizing Lonza to provide development and manufacturing services with respect to certain of our antibody and enzyme products, and will pay for the services provided and batches delivered in accordance with the DMSA and project plan. Unless earlier terminated, the DMSA will expire on September 6, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had open non-cancellable purchase orders for biological product development and manufacturing costs totaling $21.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively. The activities under these purchase orders are expected to be completed by November 2024. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total non-refundable purchase commitments of $11.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, under the DMSA.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred costs of $12.7 million and $3.9 million, and made payments of $12.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA. We had not incurred any costs or made any payments for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPursuant to certain license agreements, including our agreement with Genentech, we have obligations to make future milestone and royalty payments to other parties. Additionally, we have certain contingent payments to F-star and former shareholders of F-star Gamma related to the acquisition of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate. However, we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones and, therefore, any related payments are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nLicense and Collaboration Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), using a full retrospective application. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09 as we had not recognized any revenue through December 31, 2017. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as collaboration arrangements and leases.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, within the scope of Topic 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. The accounting treatment pursuant to Topic 606 is outlined below.\nThe terms of licensing and collaboration agreements entered into typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply and research and development services; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments results in license, collaboration and other revenue, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenue. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.\nWe record amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the related performance obligation is expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months this will be classified in current liabilities. Amounts recognized as revenue prior to the Company having an unconditional right (other than a right that is conditioned only on the passage of time) to receipt are recorded as contract assets in our consolidated balance sheets. If we expect to have an unconditional right to receive the consideration in the next twelve months, this will be classified in current assets. A net contract asset or liability is presented for each contract with a customer.\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and identify those distinct goods and services that represent a performance obligation. A promised good or service may not be identified as a performance obligation if it is immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer, if it is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (either because it is not capable of being separated or because it is not separable in the context of the contract), or if the performance obligation does not provide the customer with a material right.\nWe consider the terms of the contract to determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. Variable consideration will only be included in the transaction price when it is not considered constrained, which is when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nIf it is determined that multiple performance obligations exist, the transaction price is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling prices (\"SSP\"). The relative SSP for each deliverable is estimated using external sourced evidence if it is available. If external sourced evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of the SSP for the deliverable.\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset, which for a service is considered to be as the services are received and used. We recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward our complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\nAfter contract inception, the transaction price is reassessed at every period end and updated for changes such as resolution of uncertain events. Any change in the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations on the same basis as at contract inception.\nWe may be required to exercise considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized. Judgment is required in identifying performance obligations, estimating the transaction price, estimating the SSP of identified performance obligations, which may include forecasted revenue, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success, and estimating the progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe record research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and the development of our BBB platform technology and include: employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash stock-based compensation expense; external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, preclinical testing organizations, CDMOs, academic and non-profit institutions and consultants; costs to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use; license fees; and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.\nAs part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses. A portion of our research and development expenses are external costs, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced a late-stage IND-enabling study. We record the estimated expenses of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers based upon the estimated amount of services provided within research and development expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These services include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, contract manufacturing activities and consulting services. If the costs have been prepaid, this expense reduces the prepaid expenses in the balance sheet, and if not yet invoiced, the costs are included in accrued liabilities in the balance sheet. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We record amortization of prepaid expenses or accrued expenses for these costs based on the estimated amount of work completed and in accordance with agreements established with these third parties.\nCosts for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from external clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. To date, we have not experienced material differences between our accrued expenses and actual expenses. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and shares issued under its employee stock purchase plan to our employees, certain non-employee consultants and certain members of our board of directors. We measure stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options granted to our employees and directors on the date of grant. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2018-07, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting on September 30, 2018, future stock-based compensation expense for non-employee stock-based awards is measured based on the fair value on the date of adoption. We recognize the corresponding compensation expense of awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, and we adjust for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to our employees and directors and rights to acquire stock granted under our ESPP, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We use the fair value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\n\u2022Expected Term. Our expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term), as we do not have sufficient historical data to use any other method to estimate expected term.\n\u2022Expected Volatility. As we have very limited trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock option grants.\n\u2022Expected Dividend. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nDetermination of the estimated fair value of our common stock on grant dates prior to our IPO\nAs there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.\nWe periodically determined the estimated fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (\"Practice Aid\"). In accordance with the Practice Aid, our board of directors considered the Current Value Method, the Option-Pricing Method, and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method in estimating the fair value of our common stock.\nOur board of directors and management developed best estimates based on application of these approaches and the assumptions underlying these valuations, giving careful consideration to the advice from our third-party valuation expert. Such estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation could be materially different.\nDetermination of the fair value of our common stock on grant dates following our IPO\nThe fair value of each share of underlying common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nIn the past, we granted stock options that vest in conjunction with certain performance and market conditions to certain key employees. These awards have two separate market triggers for vesting based upon either (i) the successful achievement of stepped target closing prices on a national securities exchange for 90 consecutive trading days later than 180 days after the Company's initial public offering for its common stock, or (ii) stepped target prices for a change in control transaction. In the event that neither of these market triggers are achieved by the specified timelines, such awards will terminate with respect to that portion of the shares. Expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method and is recognized over the derived service period. We used a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation to value these performance and market contingent stock-based option awards. This valuation methodology utilized the estimated fair value of our common stock on grant date and several key assumptions, including expected volatility of our stock price based on comparable public companies, risk-free rates of return and expected dividend yield.\nStock-based compensation expense was $38.4 million, $18.8 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had $76.2 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nWe have not recognized, and we do not expect to recognize in the near future, any tax benefit related to employee stock-based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 842, Leases ( Topic 842\u201d), applying the optional transition method such that we are not required to adjust prior period presentations. ASU 2016-02 has impacted our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have certain operating lease arrangements for which we are the lessee and one operating lease arrangement for which we are the lessor. We have no financing leases. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. The impact of adoption of the standard is that as of January 1, 2019 we recognized a ROU asset of $46.1 million and operating lease liability of $71.3 million. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statements of Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit), or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe make a determination as to whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We recognize a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) asset and operating lease liability for identified operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments due over the lease term, with the ROU assets adjusted for lease incentives received. When determining the present value of lease payments, we use our incremental borrowing rate ( IBR\u201d) on the date of lease commencement, or the rate implicit in the lease, if known. We do not assume renewals or early terminations in our determination of the lease term unless it is reasonably certain at lease inception to exercise these options.\nWe do not include leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet, unless they include an option to purchase the underlying asset which is reasonably certain of exercise. We recognize lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have leases with lease and non-lease components, which we have elected to account for as a single lease component.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial

is a summary of the key points in this MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Denali Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. \n- Key strategies include: targeting genes linked to neurodegeneration, engineering drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier, and utilizing biomarkers to demonstrate target/pathway engagement.\n- Has 5 clinical programs across various indications like Parkinson's, ALS, and Hunter syndrome. Also has a proprietary platform (TV technology) to transport large molecule therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n- No product revenue to date. Has funded operations via preferred stock issuances, IPO/follow-on proceeds, and collaboration agreements.\n- Reported collaboration revenue of $26.7M in 2019, down from $129.2M in 2018, largely due to less revenue recognized from the Sanofi collaboration.  \n- R&D expenses were $193.4M in 2019, increased 35% from 2018, driven by increased spending on clinical programs. G&A expenses grew 44% to $46.5M.  \n- Net loss was $197.6M in 2019 compared to $36.2M in 2018. Loss widened significantly due to decline in collaboration revenue.\n- Ended 2019 with $455.2M in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Raised additional $194.1M in a public offering in January 2020.\n\nIn summary, Denali is advancing its pipeline but its net loss has increased substantially as collaboration revenue declined. It maintains a strong cash position to support ongoing R&D activities."}
