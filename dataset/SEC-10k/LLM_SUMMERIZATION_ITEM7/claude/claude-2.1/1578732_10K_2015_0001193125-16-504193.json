MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2015, we had over 1,600 investment sales and financing professionals operating in 79 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed 8,715 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion, an increase from 7,667 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $33.1 billion in 2014.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale and fees upon the financing of commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 6% from financing fees and 2% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions is affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and those that need financing as well as the general trends in the economy and real estate industry, including:\nEconomic and commercial real estate market conditions\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions and the demand for commercial real estate and related services in the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Fluctuations in acquisition and disposition activity, as well as general commercial real estate investment activity, can impact commissions for arranging such transactions, as well as impacting fees for arranging financing for acquirers and property owners that are seeking to recapitalize their existing properties. Despite stock market and commodity price volatility, an attractive investment backdrop continued in the commercial real estate market during 2015. We saw the market grow in both transactions and sales volume over 2014. Driving this activity is the current strength of the general economy and commercial real estate fundamentals as compared to other asset classes. We saw steady improvement in property fundamentals across all property types and construction balanced with strong demand for space.\nCredit and liquidity in the financial markets\nBecause real estate purchases are often financed with debt, credit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on flow of capital to the commercial real estate markets and as a result impact transaction activity and prices. We continue to see disciplined underwriting from lenders as well as ample liquidity in the market. However, we have seen transactions taking longer to close in late 2015. We believe, the additional diligence results in a more stable environment for investors with capital continuing to be available for properties with good fundamentals.\nFluctuations in interest rates\nChanges in interest rates as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction (increases or decreases) could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as the demand from investors for commercial real estate investments. In particular, increased interest rates may cause prices to decrease due to the increased costs of obtaining financing and could lead to decreases in purchase and sale activities, thereby reducing the amounts of investment sales and loan originations. In contrast, decreased interest rates will generally decrease the costs of obtaining financing, which could lead to increases in purchase and sales activities. In 2015, long-term interest rates remained fairly stable despite the recent Federal Reserve increase in short-term interest rates. As a result, financing costs for commercial real estate investments, generally, have not significantly increased and we believe continue to support an active real estate market.\nDemand for investment in commercial real estate\nThe willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate is affected by factors beyond our control, including the performance of real estate assets when compared with the performance of other investments. Currently, commercial real estate yields remain compelling for investors in all market segments. The strong economic fundamentals of commercial real estate coupled with the current interest rate environment continues to support an asset class with compelling yields compared to other investment assets, such as stocks or bonds. Investors looking to reap the gains of the current cycle and those seeking diversified investment options continue to support market demand and therefore demand for our brokerage and financing service offerings.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal, and combined with other factors can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, to name a few. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually in which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) or decision making group, to perform resource allocations and performance assessments. The CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review financial information presented on an office-by-office basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Based on the evaluation of our financial information, management believes that the Company's offices represent individual operating segments with similar economic characteristics that meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Our financing operations may represent an individual operating segment; however, it does not meet the thresholds to be presented as a separate reportable segment.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nOur business is transaction oriented and, as such, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by the seasonality factors discussed above, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and institutional market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of transactions closed in the middle and institutional market segments as compared to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenues different from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn ancillary fees associated with financing activities.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization and in 2013, stock-based and other compensation in connection with our IPO. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is commission expense. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees and, as such, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at the Company's election and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where the Company is the principal service provider. Cost of services can therefore vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general & administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for non-IPO related stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2013 Plan\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets or over the lesser of the asset estimated useful lives or the related lease term for leasehold improvements.\nStock-based and other compensation in connection with IPO\nIn 2013, stock-based and other compensation in connection with the IPO consists of non-cash stock based compensation and other compensation charges incurred in conjunction with our IPO. These changes related to the accelerated vesting, modifications to the restricted stock and SARs awards, grants of replacement awards in the form of DSUs to MMREIS's managing directors, a DSU grant to William A. Millichap, grants of other stock-based compensation awards pursuant to the 2013 Plan and other compensation charges incurred in connection with IPO.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, interest income and realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the SARs liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes excludes the windfall benefit from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2013 ESPP Plan\u201d). Prior to the IPO in 2013, our provision for income taxes was based on a tax-sharing agreement between us and MMC. As specified by the tax-sharing agreement, our effective tax rate was 43.5% for the pre-IPO period.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we closed more than 8,700, 7,600 and 6,600 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion, $33.1 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities are as follows:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $107.6 million, which contributed 92.1% of the total increase. An increase in financing fees of $8.7 million and to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues of $0.6 million, contributed the remaining increase in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $632.6 million in 2015 from $525.0 million in 2014, an increase of $107.6 million or 20.5%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (13.3%) and an increase in average commission rates (7.4%). The rise in average commission rates is due to an increase in the proportion of our $1-$10 million private client market segment transactions as compared to larger transactions in the middle and institutional market segments. Transactions in the private client market segment generally earn higher commission rates than the middle and institutional market segments.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $42.6 million in 2015 from $33.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 25.6%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (20.2%) due to an increase in the number of financing professionals combined with an increase in their productivity levels and an increase in average transaction size (7.6%). Average commission rates decreased slightly primarily due to the increase in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to $13.9 million in 2015 from $13.4 million in 2014, an increase of $0.6 million or 4.2%.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $574.4 million in 2015 compared to $487.6 million in 2014, an increase of $86.8 million, or 17.8%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities, but declined as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2015 increased $73.3 million, or 20.9% to $423.4 million from $350.1 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by the related increased revenues noted above. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained consistent at 61.4% in 2015 compared to 61.2% in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 increased $13.4 million, or 10.0%, to $147.7 million from $134.3 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $4.4 million increase in management performance related compensation driven by our improved operating results; (ii) a $4.1 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of higher headcount in corporate and office support in connection with our growth; (iii) a $4.0 million increase in sales and promotional expenses driven by an increase in our annual sales recognition event and marketing expenses to support increased sales activity; (iv) a $2.1 million, net increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases resulting from incremental share-based awards granted since the fourth quarter of 2014 and immediate vesting of certain RSU awards under the provisions of the RSU agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's stock price as RSU grants to the Company's independent contractors are required to be measured at fair value; (v) a $2.0 million increase in facilities expenses due to office expansion; and (vi) a $1.8 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth. The increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in legal costs due to the settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased to $0.4 million in 2015 from $28,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily from interest income and realized gains on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale. The increase was partially offset by foreign currency losses related to our Canadian operations and a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d, Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d and Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $47.0 million for 2015 as compared to $33.5 million in 2014, an increase of $13.6 million or 40.6%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 41.5%, compared with 40.3% in 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes and the valuation allowance related to our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe provisions for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $6.2 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 were recorded as credits to additional paid-in capital.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the results for the year

Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $131.7 million, which contributed 96.7% of the total increase and an increase in financing fees of $8.0 million, offset by a decrease in other revenues of $3.4 million.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $525.0 million in 2014 from $393.2 million in 2013, an increase of $131.7 million or 33.5%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (20.6%) and an increase in the average commission size (10.7%), partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates during 2014 as compared to\n2013. The average commission rate was impacted by certain large transactions during 2014 for which the commission rates were lower than our typical transactions as larger transactions generally earn a lower commission rate.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $33.9 million in 2014 from $25.9 million in 2013, an increase of $8.0 million or 30.7%. The increase during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (14.3%) primarily due to an increase in the number of financing professionals and an increase in average loan fees (14.3%), partially offset by a decrease in average financing fee rates due in part to an increase in the proportion of fees from larger loan transactions, which generally earn a lower fee percentage.\nOther revenues. Other revenues decreased to $13.4 million in 2014 from $16.8 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.4 million or 20.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in referral fees generated from other real estate brokers and a decrease in consulting and advisory services fees during 2014 as compared to 2013.\nTotal operating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $487.6 million in 2014 compared to $414.6 million in 2013, an increase of $73.0 million, or 17.6%. Operating expenses increased due to $85.5 million increase in cost of services and $18.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by a $31.3 million of non-cash stock-based and other compensation charges in connection with the IPO during 2013 with no such similar costs in 2014.\nCost of services. Cost of services, which are primarily commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs in connection with our financing activities in 2014 increased approximately $85.5 million, or 32.3% to $350.1 million from $264.6 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by the related increased revenues noted above and an increase in the proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals who are compensated generally at higher commission rates.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2014 increased $18.6 million, or 16.1%, to $134.3 million from $115.7 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to (i) an $8.6 million increase in management performance compensation driven by the increase in operating results during 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, (ii) a $3.4 million increase in staff salaries, wages and related benefits expenses driven by an increase in our average headcount in areas of salesforce support and corporate in connection with our growth and with being a public company, (iii) a $2.7 million increase in sales and marketing expenses incurred to support increased sales activity, (iv) a $1.0 million increase in third party service fees primarily driven by operating as a public company, (v) a $0.4 million increase in legal costs, and (vi) a $2.5 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nStock-based and other compensation in connection with IPO. Stock-based compensation charges in connection with IPO in 2013 were $30.9 million and related to the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and SARs, modifications to remove the formula settlement value of the restricted stock and SARs awards, grants of replacement awards in the form of DSUs to MMREIS's managing directors, a DSU grant to William A. Millichap and grants of other stock-based compensation awards pursuant to the 2013 Plan. Additionally, there were other compensation expenses of $0.4 million pertaining to the IPO. There were no similar costs for 2014. Stock-based compensation expense for periods subsequent to the IPO is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther (expense) income, net decreased to $28,000 in 2014 from $0.8 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease was primarily impacted by the net change in the carrying value of the investment assets held in the rabbi trust, offset by foreign currency losses and other non-operating items.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased to $1.7 million in 2014 from $0.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase was related to interest expense associated with the SARs liability and commitment and other fees related to our credit facility in 2014 with no such interest expense in 2013. Interest expense for notes payable to former stockholders also increased. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d, Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d and Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $33.5 million for 2014 as compared to $13.7 million in 2013, an increase of $19.7 million or 143.6%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 40.3%, compared with 62.6% in 2013. The decrease was attributable to no longer being subject to a tax-sharing agreement with MMC, which was terminated effective October 31, 2013, as well as due to unfavorable permanent differences associated with a portion of IPO related stock-based compensation in 2013.\nPrior to the IPO in 2013, our provision for income tax was based on a tax-sharing agreement between us and MMC. As specified by the agreement, our effective tax rate was 43.5% for the pre-IPO period in 2013. In 2014, our provision for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $5.2 million, were recorded as credits in additional paid-in capital.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income/expense, (ii) net realized gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale, (iii) income tax expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We find Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2011 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,450 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,373 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(153 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,355 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Other for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of $132 of net realized gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale.

In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale or availability under our credit agreement.\nCash held in our Canadian operations aggregated $763,000 and $318,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $53.0 million to $96.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $149.2 million at December 31, 2014.

Under the arrangement, our cash\nwas swept daily into an MMC money market account. We received interest on the balances held in the sweep accounts. See Note 7 - \u201cRelated-Party Transactions\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOperating Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $72.1 million in 2015 compared to $71.4 million in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $0.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in our business along with differences in timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Net Cash provided by operating activities was $71.4 million in 2014 compared to $96.9 million in 2013. The decrease from 2013 was due principally to a reduction in amounts due from affiliates of $60.4 million which resulted from the return of cash related to the termination of the cash sweep arrangement with MMC during 2013 and a decrease of $28.8 million in stock-based compensation expense (2013 includes stock-based compensation in connection with our IPO of $30.9 million). The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of $41.3 million and differences due to the timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\nInvesting Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were $126.9 million in 2015 compared to $17.2 million in 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $119.9 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2014.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Cash flows used in investing activities were $17.2 million in 2014 compared to $4.0 million in 2013. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to a total of $14.7 million in purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale in 2014 with no such purchases in 2013, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in cash paid for investment in information technology, computer hardware and software and furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.8 million in 2015 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $6.0 million in 2014. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Cash flows used in financing activities were $6.0 million in 2014, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $4.9 million in 2013. The change in cash flows used for financing activities in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to (i) a $42.5 million in proceeds received from our IPO, net of issuance costs and dividend payments to MMC of $37.7 million in 2013 with no such comparable proceeds and payments in 2014 and (ii) $6.0 million of withholding taxes paid in 2014 related to shares withheld from equity awards to employees. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale and borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from, among other factors, to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs liability have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 18, 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cBank\u201d), dated as of June 1, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement is intended to provide for future liquidity needs, if needed. The Credit Agreement provides for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), which would have originally matured on June 1, 2017. On August 21, 2015, we extended the Credit Agreement, which now matures on June 1, 2018. There were no other changes to the original terms. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility must be repaid in full. We must pay a commitment fee of up to 0.1% per annum, payable quarterly, based on the amount of unutilized commitments under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $533,000 was utilized at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the (i) Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Bank's prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.5% and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.5%), or (ii) at a variable rate between 0.875% and 1.125% above LIBOR, based upon the total funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including financial covenants (which require us, on a combined basis with our guarantors, to maintain (i) an EBITDAR Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25:1.0 as of each quarter end on a rolling 4-quarter basis and (ii) total funded debt to EBITDA not greater than 2.0:1.0), reporting requirements and events of default. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including pledges of 100% of the stock or other equity interest of each subsidiary except to the extent such property constitutes the capital stock of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), in which case no such pledge is required.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SARs liability (principal and interest) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable (principal and interest) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred commissions payable (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred compensation liability (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Forecasted principal payments are based on each participants estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 4.273% on January 1, 2016 and do not reflect changes that may result from Mr. Kerin's retirement.

However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change negatively or positively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical\nto aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for real estate owners or investors seeking to buy or sell commercial properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees from securing financing on purchase transactions as well as fees earned from refinancing its clients' existing mortgage debt and other financing activities are recognized in principally all cases on the close of escrow or when the loan closes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe initially value restricted stock units and restricted stock awards based on the grant date closing price of our common stock and recognize the related expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, subject to periodic adjustments to ensure that the cumulative amount of expense recognized through the end of any reporting period is at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that has vested through that date. Awards made to our independent contractors, who are primarily our investment sales professionals, are accounted for as liability awards and require remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Compensation expense is adjusted for estimated forfeitures and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We may be required to use judgment in determining the service period for awards granted based on contract terms. Forfeiture assumptions for all stock-based awards are based on historical forfeitures for different classes of service providers. Assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary.\nWe estimate the grant-date fair value for issuances under the 2013 ESPP Plan using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determined that the plan was a compensatory plan and the Company is required to expense the fair value of the awards over each six-month offering period. We use judgments and assumptions in determining the value of the awards. We calculate the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock and the risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, both consistent with the term of the offering period. We incorporate no forfeiture rate and include no expected dividend yield as the Company has not paid, and currently does not intend to pay, a regular dividend.\nStock-Based Compensation Prior to the IPO\nPrior to the IPO, we had a different stock-based compensation program. MMREIS issued stock options and stock appreciation rights, or SARs, to key employees through a book value, stock-based compensation award program. For additional information see Note 2 - \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (1) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (2) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize into income the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, we use estimates to determine state tax apportionment, foreign and local taxes, recognized and unrecognized tax positions, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items, all which impact our effective tax rate. Changes in these estimates are as a result of changes in the mix of our activity in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the nature and extent of other estimates.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nPrior to the IPO, we were part of a consolidated federal income tax return and various combined and consolidated state tax returns that were filed by our previous parent. We had a tax-sharing agreement whereby we provided for income taxes in our consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income using an effective tax rate of 43.5%.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities, including U.S. government and agency debt securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and money market funds. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase. Interest, along with accretion and amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, which are recorded over the remaining weighted average life of the security, are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income.\nWe regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other items, the time frame and extent to which the fair market value of a security is less than its amortized cost and our intent and ability to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The assumptions and judgments may change based on changes in our operations or future plans.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to various legal proceeding and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount. Most of these litigation matters are covered by insurance which contain deductibles, exclusions, claim limits and aggregate policy limits. While the ultimate liability for these legal proceeding cannot be determined, we use judgment in the evaluation claims and the need for accrual for loss contingencies quarterly. We record an accrual for litigation related losses where we determine the likelihood of loss is both probable and estimable. We accrue legal fees for litigation as the legal services are provided.\nLeases\nWe lease all of our facilities under operating lease agreements. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent or contain predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent. We recognize the minimum lease payments as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable term of the lease. We\nrecord the difference between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent obligation. We typically lease general purpose built-out office space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for improvements, net of incentives received, are recorded as prepaid rent. Prepaid rent is amortized using the straight-line method over the expected lease term as a charge to rent expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2015, we had over 1,600 investment sales and financing professionals operating in 79 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed 8,715 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion, an increase from 7,667 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $33.1 billion in 2014.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale and fees upon the financing of commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 6% from financing fees and 2% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions is affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and those that need financing as well as the general trends in the economy and real estate industry, including:\nEconomic and commercial real estate market conditions\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions and the demand for commercial real estate and related services in the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Fluctuations in acquisition and disposition activity, as well as general commercial real estate investment activity, can impact commissions for arranging such transactions, as well as impacting fees for arranging financing for acquirers and property owners that are seeking to recapitalize their existing properties. Despite stock market and commodity price volatility, an attractive investment backdrop continued in the commercial real estate market during 2015. We saw the market grow in both transactions and sales volume over 2014. Driving this activity is the current strength of the general economy and commercial real estate fundamentals as compared to other asset classes. We saw steady improvement in property fundamentals across all property types and construction balanced with strong demand for space.\nCredit and liquidity in the financial markets\nBecause real estate purchases are often financed with debt, credit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on flow of capital to the commercial real estate markets and as a result impact transaction activity and prices. We continue to see disciplined underwriting from lenders as well as ample liquidity in the market. However, we have seen transactions taking longer to close in late 2015. We believe, the additional diligence results in a more stable environment for investors with capital continuing to be available for properties with good fundamentals.\nFluctuations in interest rates\nChanges in interest rates as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction (increases or decreases) could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as the demand from investors for commercial real estate investments. In particular, increased interest rates may cause prices to decrease due to the increased costs of obtaining financing and could lead to decreases in purchase and sale activities, thereby reducing the amounts of investment sales and loan originations. In contrast, decreased interest rates will generally decrease the costs of obtaining financing, which could lead to increases in purchase and sales activities. In 2015, long-term interest rates remained fairly stable despite the recent Federal Reserve increase in short-term interest rates. As a result, financing costs for commercial real estate investments, generally, have not significantly increased and we believe continue to support an active real estate market.\nDemand for investment in commercial real estate\nThe willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate is affected by factors beyond our control, including the performance of real estate assets when compared with the performance of other investments. Currently, commercial real estate yields remain compelling for investors in all market segments. The strong economic fundamentals of commercial real estate coupled with the current interest rate environment continues to support an asset class with compelling yields compared to other investment assets, such as stocks or bonds. Investors looking to reap the gains of the current cycle and those seeking diversified investment options continue to support market demand and therefore demand for our brokerage and financing service offerings.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal, and combined with other factors can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, to name a few. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually in which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) or decision making group, to perform resource allocations and performance assessments. The CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review financial information presented on an office-by-office basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Based on the evaluation of our financial information, management believes that the Company's offices represent individual operating segments with similar economic characteristics that meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Our financing operations may represent an individual operating segment; however, it does not meet the thresholds to be presented as a separate reportable segment.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nOur business is transaction oriented and, as such, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by the seasonality factors discussed above, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and institutional market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of transactions closed in the middle and institutional market segments as compared to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenues different from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn ancillary fees associated with financing activities.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization and in 2013, stock-based and other compensation in connection with our IPO. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is commission expense. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees and, as such, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at the Company's election and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where the Company is the principal service provider. Cost of services can therefore vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general & administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for non-IPO related stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2013 Plan\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets or over the lesser of the asset estimated useful lives or the related lease term for leasehold improvements.\nStock-based and other compensation in connection with IPO\nIn 2013, stock-based and other compensation in connection with the IPO consists of non-cash stock based compensation and other compensation charges incurred in conjunction with our IPO. These changes related to the accelerated vesting, modifications to the restricted stock and SARs awards, grants of replacement awards in the form of DSUs to MMREIS's managing directors, a DSU grant to William A. Millichap, grants of other stock-based compensation awards pursuant to the 2013 Plan and other compensation charges incurred in connection with IPO.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, interest income and realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the SARs liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes excludes the windfall benefit from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2013 ESPP Plan\u201d). Prior to the IPO in 2013, our provision for income taxes was based on a tax-sharing agreement between us and MMC. As specified by the tax-sharing agreement, our effective tax rate was 43.5% for the pre-IPO period.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we closed more than 8,700, 7,600 and 6,600 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion, $33.1 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities are as follows:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $689.1 million in 2015 compared to $572.2 million in 2014, an increase of $116.9 million, or 20.4%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $107.6 million, which contributed 92.1% of the total increase. An increase in financing fees of $8.7 million and to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues of $0.6 million, contributed the remaining increase in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $632.6 million in 2015 from $525.0 million in 2014, an increase of $107.6 million or 20.5%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (13.3%) and an increase in average commission rates (7.4%). The rise in average commission rates is due to an increase in the proportion of our $1-$10 million private client market segment transactions as compared to larger transactions in the middle and institutional market segments. Transactions in the private client market segment generally earn higher commission rates than the middle and institutional market segments.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $42.6 million in 2015 from $33.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 25.6%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (20.2%) due to an increase in the number of financing professionals combined with an increase in their productivity levels and an increase in average transaction size (7.6%). Average commission rates decreased slightly primarily due to the increase in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to $13.9 million in 2015 from $13.4 million in 2014, an increase of $0.6 million or 4.2%.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $574.4 million in 2015 compared to $487.6 million in 2014, an increase of $86.8 million, or 17.8%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities, but declined as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2015 increased $73.3 million, or 20.9% to $423.4 million from $350.1 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by the related increased revenues noted above. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained consistent at 61.4% in 2015 compared to 61.2% in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 increased $13.4 million, or 10.0%, to $147.7 million from $134.3 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $4.4 million increase in management performance related compensation driven by our improved operating results; (ii) a $4.1 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of higher headcount in corporate and office support in connection with our growth; (iii) a $4.0 million increase in sales and promotional expenses driven by an increase in our annual sales recognition event and marketing expenses to support increased sales activity; (iv) a $2.1 million, net increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases resulting from incremental share-based awards granted since the fourth quarter of 2014 and immediate vesting of certain RSU awards under the provisions of the RSU agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's stock price as RSU grants to the Company's independent contractors are required to be measured at fair value; (v) a $2.0 million increase in facilities expenses due to office expansion; and (vi) a $1.8 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth. The increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in legal costs due to the settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased to $0.4 million in 2015 from $28,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily from interest income and realized gains on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale. The increase was partially offset by foreign currency losses related to our Canadian operations and a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d, Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d and Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $47.0 million for 2015 as compared to $33.5 million in 2014, an increase of $13.6 million or 40.6%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 41.5%, compared with 40.3% in 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes and the valuation allowance related to our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe provisions for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $6.2 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 were recorded as credits to additional paid-in capital.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the results for the year

Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $131.7 million, which contributed 96.7% of the total increase and an increase in financing fees of $8.0 million, offset by a decrease in other revenues of $3.4 million.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $525.0 million in 2014 from $393.2 million in 2013, an increase of $131.7 million or 33.5%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (20.6%) and an increase in the average commission size (10.7%), partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates during 2014 as compared to\n2013. The average commission rate was impacted by certain large transactions during 2014 for which the commission rates were lower than our typical transactions as larger transactions generally earn a lower commission rate.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $33.9 million in 2014 from $25.9 million in 2013, an increase of $8.0 million or 30.7%. The increase during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (14.3%) primarily due to an increase in the number of financing professionals and an increase in average loan fees (14.3%), partially offset by a decrease in average financing fee rates due in part to an increase in the proportion of fees from larger loan transactions, which generally earn a lower fee percentage.\nOther revenues. Other revenues decreased to $13.4 million in 2014 from $16.8 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.4 million or 20.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in referral fees generated from other real estate brokers and a decrease in consulting and advisory services fees during 2014 as compared to 2013.\nTotal operating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $487.6 million in 2014 compared to $414.6 million in 2013, an increase of $73.0 million, or 17.6%. Operating expenses increased due to $85.5 million increase in cost of services and $18.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by a $31.3 million of non-cash stock-based and other compensation charges in connection with the IPO during 2013 with no such similar costs in 2014.\nCost of services. Cost of services, which are primarily commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs in connection with our financing activities in 2014 increased approximately $85.5 million, or 32.3% to $350.1 million from $264.6 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by the related increased revenues noted above and an increase in the proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals who are compensated generally at higher commission rates.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2014 increased $18.6 million, or 16.1%, to $134.3 million from $115.7 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to (i) an $8.6 million increase in management performance compensation driven by the increase in operating results during 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, (ii) a $3.4 million increase in staff salaries, wages and related benefits expenses driven by an increase in our average headcount in areas of salesforce support and corporate in connection with our growth and with being a public company, (iii) a $2.7 million increase in sales and marketing expenses incurred to support increased sales activity, (iv) a $1.0 million increase in third party service fees primarily driven by operating as a public company, (v) a $0.4 million increase in legal costs, and (vi) a $2.5 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nStock-based and other compensation in connection with IPO. Stock-based compensation charges in connection with IPO in 2013 were $30.9 million and related to the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and SARs, modifications to remove the formula settlement value of the restricted stock and SARs awards, grants of replacement awards in the form of DSUs to MMREIS's managing directors, a DSU grant to William A. Millichap and grants of other stock-based compensation awards pursuant to the 2013 Plan. Additionally, there were other compensation expenses of $0.4 million pertaining to the IPO. There were no similar costs for 2014. Stock-based compensation expense for periods subsequent to the IPO is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther (expense) income, net decreased to $28,000 in 2014 from $0.8 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease was primarily impacted by the net change in the carrying value of the investment assets held in the rabbi trust, offset by foreign currency losses and other non-operating items.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased to $1.7 million in 2014 from $0.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase was related to interest expense associated with the SARs liability and commitment and other fees related to our credit facility in 2014 with no such interest expense in 2013. Interest expense for notes payable to former stockholders also increased. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d, Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d and Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $33.5 million for 2014 as compared to $13.7 million in 2013, an increase of $19.7 million or 143.6%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 40.3%, compared with 62.6% in 2013. The decrease was attributable to no longer being subject to a tax-sharing agreement with MMC, which was terminated effective October 31, 2013, as well as due to unfavorable permanent differences associated with a portion of IPO related stock-based compensation in 2013.\nPrior to the IPO in 2013, our provision for income tax was based on a tax-sharing agreement between us and MMC. As specified by the agreement, our effective tax rate was 43.5% for the pre-IPO period in 2013. In 2014, our provision for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $5.2 million, were recorded as credits in additional paid-in capital.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income/expense, (ii) net realized gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale, (iii) income tax expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We find Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2011 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,450 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,373 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(153 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,355 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Other for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of $132 of net realized gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale. The year ended December 31, 2013 includes employer taxes related to DSUs and restricted stock in connection with IPO. \n (2) The year ended December 31, 2013 includes non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $30.9 million in connection with the IPO. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale and, if necessary borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale or availability under our credit agreement.\nCash held in our Canadian operations aggregated $763,000 and $318,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $53.0 million to $96.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $149.2 million at December 31, 2014. The following table sets forth our summary cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126,929 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,225 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,024 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,005 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,925 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,974 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Prior to its termination on June 30, 2013, we were subject to a cash sweep arrangement with MMC and the change in our cash held by MMC was considered to be an operating activity. Under the arrangement, our cash\nwas swept daily into an MMC money market account. We received interest on the balances held in the sweep accounts. See Note 7 - \u201cRelated-Party Transactions\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOperating Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $72.1 million in 2015 compared to $71.4 million in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $0.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in our business along with differences in timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Net Cash provided by operating activities was $71.4 million in 2014 compared to $96.9 million in 2013. The decrease from 2013 was due principally to a reduction in amounts due from affiliates of $60.4 million which resulted from the return of cash related to the termination of the cash sweep arrangement with MMC during 2013 and a decrease of $28.8 million in stock-based compensation expense (2013 includes stock-based compensation in connection with our IPO of $30.9 million). The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of $41.3 million and differences due to the timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\nInvesting Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were $126.9 million in 2015 compared to $17.2 million in 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $119.9 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2014.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Cash flows used in investing activities were $17.2 million in 2014 compared to $4.0 million in 2013. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to a total of $14.7 million in purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale in 2014 with no such purchases in 2013, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in cash paid for investment in information technology, computer hardware and software and furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.8 million in 2015 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $6.0 million in 2014. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Cash flows used in financing activities were $6.0 million in 2014, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $4.9 million in 2013. The change in cash flows used for financing activities in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to (i) a $42.5 million in proceeds received from our IPO, net of issuance costs and dividend payments to MMC of $37.7 million in 2013 with no such comparable proceeds and payments in 2014 and (ii) $6.0 million of withholding taxes paid in 2014 related to shares withheld from equity awards to employees. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale and borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from, among other factors, to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs liability have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 18, 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cBank\u201d), dated as of June 1, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement is intended to provide for future liquidity needs, if needed. The Credit Agreement provides for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), which would have originally matured on June 1, 2017. On August 21, 2015, we extended the Credit Agreement, which now matures on June 1, 2018. There were no other changes to the original terms. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility must be repaid in full. We must pay a commitment fee of up to 0.1% per annum, payable quarterly, based on the amount of unutilized commitments under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $533,000 was utilized at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the (i) Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Bank's prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.5% and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.5%), or (ii) at a variable rate between 0.875% and 1.125% above LIBOR, based upon the total funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including financial covenants (which require us, on a combined basis with our guarantors, to maintain (i) an EBITDAR Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25:1.0 as of each quarter end on a rolling 4-quarter basis and (ii) total funded debt to EBITDA not greater than 2.0:1.0), reporting requirements and events of default. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including pledges of 100% of the stock or other equity interest of each subsidiary except to the extent such property constitutes the capital stock of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), in which case no such pledge is required.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SARs liability (principal and interest) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable (principal and interest) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred commissions payable (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred compensation liability (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (2) Forecasted principal payments are based on each participants estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 4.273% on January 1, 2016 and do not reflect changes that may result from Mr. Kerin's retirement.

However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change negatively or positively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical\nto aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for real estate owners or investors seeking to buy or sell commercial properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees from securing financing on purchase transactions as well as fees earned from refinancing its clients' existing mortgage debt and other financing activities are recognized in principally all cases on the close of escrow or when the loan closes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe initially value restricted stock units and restricted stock awards based on the grant date closing price of our common stock and recognize the related expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, subject to periodic adjustments to ensure that the cumulative amount of expense recognized through the end of any reporting period is at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that has vested through that date. Awards made to our independent contractors, who are primarily our investment sales professionals, are accounted for as liability awards and require remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Compensation expense is adjusted for estimated forfeitures and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We may be required to use judgment in determining the service period for awards granted based on contract terms. Forfeiture assumptions for all stock-based awards are based on historical forfeitures for different classes of service providers. Assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary.\nWe estimate the grant-date fair value for issuances under the 2013 ESPP Plan using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determined that the plan was a compensatory plan and the Company is required to expense the fair value of the awards over each six-month offering period. We use judgments and assumptions in determining the value of the awards. We calculate the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock and the risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, both consistent with the term of the offering period. We incorporate no forfeiture rate and include no expected dividend yield as the Company has not paid, and currently does not intend to pay, a regular dividend.\nStock-Based Compensation Prior to the IPO\nPrior to the IPO, we had a different stock-based compensation program. MMREIS issued stock options and stock appreciation rights, or SARs, to key employees through a book value, stock-based compensation award program. For additional information see Note 2 - \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (1) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (2) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize into income the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, we use estimates to determine state tax apportionment, foreign and local taxes, recognized and unrecognized tax positions, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items, all which impact our effective tax rate. Changes in these estimates are as a result of changes in the mix of our activity in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the nature and extent of other estimates.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nPrior to the IPO, we were part of a consolidated federal income tax return and various combined and consolidated state tax returns that were filed by our previous parent. We had a tax-sharing agreement whereby we provided for income taxes in our consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income using an effective tax rate of 43.5%.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities, including U.S. government and agency debt securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and money market funds. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase. Interest, along with accretion and amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, which are recorded over the remaining weighted average life of the security, are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income.\nWe regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other items, the time frame and extent to which the fair market value of a security is less than its amortized cost and our intent and ability to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The assumptions and judgments may change based on changes in our operations or future plans.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to various legal proceeding and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount. Most of these litigation matters are covered by insurance which contain deductibles, exclusions, claim limits and aggregate policy limits. While the ultimate liability for these legal proceeding cannot be determined, we use judgment in the evaluation claims and the need for accrual for loss contingencies quarterly. We record an accrual for litigation related losses where we determine the likelihood of loss is both probable and estimable. We accrue legal fees for litigation as the legal services are provided.\nLeases\nWe lease all of our facilities under operating lease agreements. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent or contain predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent. We recognize the minimum lease payments as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable term of the lease. We\nrecord the difference between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent obligation. We typically lease general purpose built-out office space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for improvements, net of incentives received, are recorded as prepaid rent. Prepaid rent is amortized using the straight-line method over the expected lease term as a charge to rent expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2015, we had over 1,600 investment sales and financing professionals operating in 79 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed 8,715 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion, an increase from 7,667 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $33.1 billion in 2014.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale and fees upon the financing of commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 6% from financing fees and 2% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions is affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and those that need financing as well as the general trends in the economy and real estate industry, including:\nEconomic and commercial real estate market conditions\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions and the demand for commercial real estate and related services in the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Fluctuations in acquisition and disposition activity, as well as general commercial real estate investment activity, can impact commissions for arranging such transactions, as well as impacting fees for arranging financing for acquirers and property owners that are seeking to recapitalize their existing properties. Despite stock market and commodity price volatility, an attractive investment backdrop continued in the commercial real estate market during 2015. We saw the market grow in both transactions and sales volume over 2014. Driving this activity is the current strength of the general economy and commercial real estate fundamentals as compared to other asset classes. We saw steady improvement in property fundamentals across all property types and construction balanced with strong demand for space.\nCredit and liquidity in the financial markets\nBecause real estate purchases are often financed with debt, credit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on flow of capital to the commercial real estate markets and as a result impact transaction activity and prices. We continue to see disciplined underwriting from lenders as well as ample liquidity in the market. However, we have seen transactions taking longer to close in late 2015. We believe, the additional diligence results in a more stable environment for investors with capital continuing to be available for properties with good fundamentals.\nFluctuations in interest rates\nChanges in interest rates as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction (increases or decreases) could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as the demand from investors for commercial real estate investments. In particular, increased interest rates may cause prices to decrease due to the increased costs of obtaining financing and could lead to decreases in purchase and sale activities, thereby reducing the amounts of investment sales and loan originations. In contrast, decreased interest rates will generally decrease the costs of obtaining financing, which could lead to increases in purchase and sales activities. In 2015, long-term interest rates remained fairly stable despite the recent Federal Reserve increase in short-term interest rates. As a result, financing costs for commercial real estate investments, generally, have not significantly increased and we believe continue to support an active real estate market.\nDemand for investment in commercial real estate\nThe willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate is affected by factors beyond our control, including the performance of real estate assets when compared with the performance of other investments. Currently, commercial real estate yields remain compelling for investors in all market segments. The strong economic fundamentals of commercial real estate coupled with the current interest rate environment continues to support an asset class with compelling yields compared to other investment assets, such as stocks or bonds. Investors looking to reap the gains of the current cycle and those seeking diversified investment options continue to support market demand and therefore demand for our brokerage and financing service offerings.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal, and combined with other factors can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, to name a few. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually in which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) or decision making group, to perform resource allocations and performance assessments. The CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review financial information presented on an office-by-office basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Based on the evaluation of our financial information, management believes that the Company's offices represent individual operating segments with similar economic characteristics that meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Our financing operations may represent an individual operating segment; however, it does not meet the thresholds to be presented as a separate reportable segment.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nOur business is transaction oriented and, as such, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by the seasonality factors discussed above, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and institutional market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of transactions closed in the middle and institutional market segments as compared to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenues different from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn ancillary fees associated with financing activities.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization and in 2013, stock-based and other compensation in connection with our IPO. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is commission expense. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees and, as such, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at the Company's election and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where the Company is the principal service provider. Cost of services can therefore vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general & administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for non-IPO related stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2013 Plan\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets or over the lesser of the asset estimated useful lives or the related lease term for leasehold improvements.\nStock-based and other compensation in connection with IPO\nIn 2013, stock-based and other compensation in connection with the IPO consists of non-cash stock based compensation and other compensation charges incurred in conjunction with our IPO. These changes related to the accelerated vesting, modifications to the restricted stock and SARs awards, grants of replacement awards in the form of DSUs to MMREIS's managing directors, a DSU grant to William A. Millichap, grants of other stock-based compensation awards pursuant to the 2013 Plan and other compensation charges incurred in connection with IPO.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, interest income and realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the SARs liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes excludes the windfall benefit from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2013 ESPP Plan\u201d). Prior to the IPO in 2013, our provision for income taxes was based on a tax-sharing agreement between us and MMC. As specified by the tax-sharing agreement, our effective tax rate was 43.5% for the pre-IPO period.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we closed more than 8,700, 7,600 and 6,600 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion, $33.1 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities are as follows:\n\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $689.1 million in 2015 compared to $572.2 million in 2014, an increase of $116.9 million, or 20.4%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $107.6 million, which contributed 92.1% of the total increase. An increase in financing fees of $8.7 million and to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues of $0.6 million, contributed the remaining increase in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $632.6 million in 2015 from $525.0 million in 2014, an increase of $107.6 million or 20.5%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (13.3%) and an increase in average commission rates (7.4%). The rise in average commission rates is due to an increase in the proportion of our $1-$10 million private client market segment transactions as compared to larger transactions in the middle and institutional market segments. Transactions in the private client market segment generally earn higher commission rates than the middle and institutional market segments.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $42.6 million in 2015 from $33.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 25.6%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (20.2%) due to an increase in the number of financing professionals combined with an increase in their productivity levels and an increase in average transaction size (7.6%). Average commission rates decreased slightly primarily due to the increase in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to $13.9 million in 2015 from $13.4 million in 2014, an increase of $0.6 million or 4.2%.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $574.4 million in 2015 compared to $487.6 million in 2014, an increase of $86.8 million, or 17.8%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities, but declined as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2015 increased $73.3 million, or 20.9% to $423.4 million from $350.1 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by the related increased revenues noted above. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained consistent at 61.4% in 2015 compared to 61.2% in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 increased $13.4 million, or 10.0%, to $147.7 million from $134.3 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $4.4 million increase in management performance related compensation driven by our improved operating results; (ii) a $4.1 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of higher headcount in corporate and office support in connection with our growth; (iii) a $4.0 million increase in sales and promotional expenses driven by an increase in our annual sales recognition event and marketing expenses to support increased sales activity; (iv) a $2.1 million, net increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases resulting from incremental share-based awards granted since the fourth quarter of 2014 and immediate vesting of certain RSU awards under the provisions of the RSU agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's stock price as RSU grants to the Company's independent contractors are required to be measured at fair value; (v) a $2.0 million increase in facilities expenses due to office expansion; and (vi) a $1.8 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth. The increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in legal costs due to the settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased to $0.4 million in 2015 from $28,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily from interest income and realized gains on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale. The increase was partially offset by foreign currency losses related to our Canadian operations and a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d, Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d and Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $47.0 million for 2015 as compared to $33.5 million in 2014, an increase of $13.6 million or 40.6%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 41.5%, compared with 40.3% in 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes and the valuation allowance related to our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe provisions for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $6.2 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 were recorded as credits to additional paid-in capital.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $572.2 million in 2014 compared to $435.9 million in 2013, an increase of $136.3 million, or 31.3%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $131.7 million, which contributed 96.7% of the total increase and an increase in financing fees of $8.0 million, offset by a decrease in other revenues of $3.4 million.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $525.0 million in 2014 from $393.2 million in 2013, an increase of $131.7 million or 33.5%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (20.6%) and an increase in the average commission size (10.7%), partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates during 2014 as compared to\n2013. The average commission rate was impacted by certain large transactions during 2014 for which the commission rates were lower than our typical transactions as larger transactions generally earn a lower commission rate.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $33.9 million in 2014 from $25.9 million in 2013, an increase of $8.0 million or 30.7%. The increase during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (14.3%) primarily due to an increase in the number of financing professionals and an increase in average loan fees (14.3%), partially offset by a decrease in average financing fee rates due in part to an increase in the proportion of fees from larger loan transactions, which generally earn a lower fee percentage.\nOther revenues. Other revenues decreased to $13.4 million in 2014 from $16.8 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.4 million or 20.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in referral fees generated from other real estate brokers and a decrease in consulting and advisory services fees during 2014 as compared to 2013.\nTotal operating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $487.6 million in 2014 compared to $414.6 million in 2013, an increase of $73.0 million, or 17.6%. Operating expenses increased due to $85.5 million increase in cost of services and $18.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by a $31.3 million of non-cash stock-based and other compensation charges in connection with the IPO during 2013 with no such similar costs in 2014.\nCost of services. Cost of services, which are primarily commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs in connection with our financing activities in 2014 increased approximately $85.5 million, or 32.3% to $350.1 million from $264.6 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by the related increased revenues noted above and an increase in the proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals who are compensated generally at higher commission rates.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2014 increased $18.6 million, or 16.1%, to $134.3 million from $115.7 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to (i) an $8.6 million increase in management performance compensation driven by the increase in operating results during 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, (ii) a $3.4 million increase in staff salaries, wages and related benefits expenses driven by an increase in our average headcount in areas of salesforce support and corporate in connection with our growth and with being a public company, (iii) a $2.7 million increase in sales and marketing expenses incurred to support increased sales activity, (iv) a $1.0 million increase in third party service fees primarily driven by operating as a public company, (v) a $0.4 million increase in legal costs, and (vi) a $2.5 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nStock-based and other compensation in connection with IPO. Stock-based compensation charges in connection with IPO in 2013 were $30.9 million and related to the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and SARs, modifications to remove the formula settlement value of the restricted stock and SARs awards, grants of replacement awards in the form of DSUs to MMREIS's managing directors, a DSU grant to William A. Millichap and grants of other stock-based compensation awards pursuant to the 2013 Plan. Additionally, there were other compensation expenses of $0.4 million pertaining to the IPO. There were no similar costs for 2014. Stock-based compensation expense for periods subsequent to the IPO is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther (expense) income, net decreased to $28,000 in 2014 from $0.8 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease was primarily impacted by the net change in the carrying value of the investment assets held in the rabbi trust, offset by foreign currency losses and other non-operating items.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased to $1.7 million in 2014 from $0.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase was related to interest expense associated with the SARs liability and commitment and other fees related to our credit facility in 2014 with no such interest expense in 2013. Interest expense for notes payable to former stockholders also increased. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d, Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d and Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $33.5 million for 2014 as compared to $13.7 million in 2013, an increase of $19.7 million or 143.6%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 40.3%, compared with 62.6% in 2013. The decrease was attributable to no longer being subject to a tax-sharing agreement with MMC, which was terminated effective October 31, 2013, as well as due to unfavorable permanent differences associated with a portion of IPO related stock-based compensation in 2013.\nPrior to the IPO in 2013, our provision for income tax was based on a tax-sharing agreement between us and MMC. As specified by the agreement, our effective tax rate was 43.5% for the pre-IPO period in 2013. In 2014, our provision for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $5.2 million, were recorded as credits in additional paid-in capital.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income/expense, (ii) net realized gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale, (iii) income tax expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We find Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Other for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of $132 of net realized gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale. The year ended December 31, 2013 includes employer taxes related to DSUs and restricted stock in connection with IPO. \n (2) The year ended December 31, 2013 includes non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $30.9 million in connection with the IPO. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale and, if necessary borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale or availability under our credit agreement.\nCash held in our Canadian operations aggregated $763,000 and $318,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $53.0 million to $96.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $149.2 million at December 31, 2014. The following table sets forth our summary cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\n Prior to its termination on June 30, 2013, we were subject to a cash sweep arrangement with MMC and the change in our cash held by MMC was considered to be an operating activity. Under the arrangement, our cash\nwas swept daily into an MMC money market account. We received interest on the balances held in the sweep accounts. See Note 7 - \u201cRelated-Party Transactions\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOperating Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $72.1 million in 2015 compared to $71.4 million in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $0.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in our business along with differences in timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Net Cash provided by operating activities was $71.4 million in 2014 compared to $96.9 million in 2013. The decrease from 2013 was due principally to a reduction in amounts due from affiliates of $60.4 million which resulted from the return of cash related to the termination of the cash sweep arrangement with MMC during 2013 and a decrease of $28.8 million in stock-based compensation expense (2013 includes stock-based compensation in connection with our IPO of $30.9 million). The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of $41.3 million and differences due to the timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\nInvesting Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were $126.9 million in 2015 compared to $17.2 million in 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $119.9 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2014.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Cash flows used in investing activities were $17.2 million in 2014 compared to $4.0 million in 2013. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to a total of $14.7 million in purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale in 2014 with no such purchases in 2013, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in cash paid for investment in information technology, computer hardware and software and furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.8 million in 2015 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $6.0 million in 2014. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2014 Compared to 2013. Cash flows used in financing activities were $6.0 million in 2014, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $4.9 million in 2013. The change in cash flows used for financing activities in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to (i) a $42.5 million in proceeds received from our IPO, net of issuance costs and dividend payments to MMC of $37.7 million in 2013 with no such comparable proceeds and payments in 2014 and (ii) $6.0 million of withholding taxes paid in 2014 related to shares withheld from equity awards to employees. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale and borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from, among other factors, to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs liability have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 18, 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cBank\u201d), dated as of June 1, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement is intended to provide for future liquidity needs, if needed. The Credit Agreement provides for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), which would have originally matured on June 1, 2017. On August 21, 2015, we extended the Credit Agreement, which now matures on June 1, 2018. There were no other changes to the original terms. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility must be repaid in full. We must pay a commitment fee of up to 0.1% per annum, payable quarterly, based on the amount of unutilized commitments under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $533,000 was utilized at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the (i) Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Bank's prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.5% and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.5%), or (ii) at a variable rate between 0.875% and 1.125% above LIBOR, based upon the total funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including financial covenants (which require us, on a combined basis with our guarantors, to maintain (i) an EBITDAR Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25:1.0 as of each quarter end on a rolling 4-quarter basis and (ii) total funded debt to EBITDA not greater than 2.0:1.0), reporting requirements and events of default. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including pledges of 100% of the stock or other equity interest of each subsidiary except to the extent such property constitutes the capital stock of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), in which case no such pledge is required.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n (1) See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (2) Forecasted principal payments are based on each participants estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 4.273% on January 1, 2016 and do not reflect changes that may result from Mr. Kerin's retirement. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (3) See Note 6 - \u201cNotes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (4) Includes short-term and long-term deferred commissions payable. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (5) Actual payments are dependent on each participant's future elections as to settlement of deferred compensation. The Company holds assets held in rabbi trust of $5.7 million to settle outstanding amounts when they become due. See Note 4 - \u201cSelected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (6) See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation. However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change negatively or positively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical\nto aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for real estate owners or investors seeking to buy or sell commercial properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees from securing financing on purchase transactions as well as fees earned from refinancing its clients' existing mortgage debt and other financing activities are recognized in principally all cases on the close of escrow or when the loan closes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe initially value restricted stock units and restricted stock awards based on the grant date closing price of our common stock and recognize the related expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, subject to periodic adjustments to ensure that the cumulative amount of expense recognized through the end of any reporting period is at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that has vested through that date. Awards made to our independent contractors, who are primarily our investment sales professionals, are accounted for as liability awards and require remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Compensation expense is adjusted for estimated forfeitures and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We may be required to use judgment in determining the service period for awards granted based on contract terms. Forfeiture assumptions for all stock-based awards are based on historical forfeitures for different classes of service providers. Assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary.\nWe estimate the grant-date fair value for issuances under the 2013 ESPP Plan using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determined that the plan was a compensatory plan and the Company is required to expense the fair value of the awards over each six-month offering period. We use judgments and assumptions in determining the value of the awards. We calculate the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock and the risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, both consistent with the term of the offering period. We incorporate no forfeiture rate and include no expected dividend yield as the Company has not paid, and currently does not intend to pay, a regular dividend.\nStock-Based Compensation Prior to the IPO\nPrior to the IPO, we had a different stock-based compensation program. MMREIS issued stock options and stock appreciation rights, or SARs, to key employees through a book value, stock-based compensation award program. For additional information see Note 2 - \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (1) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (2) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize into income the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, we use estimates to determine state tax apportionment, foreign and local taxes, recognized and unrecognized tax positions, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items, all which impact our effective tax rate. Changes in these estimates are as a result of changes in the mix of our activity in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the nature and extent of other estimates.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nPrior to the IPO, we were part of a consolidated federal income tax return and various combined and consolidated state tax returns that were filed by our previous parent. We had a tax-sharing agreement whereby we provided for income taxes in our consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income using an effective tax rate of 43.5%.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities, including U.S. government and agency debt securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and money market funds. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase. Interest, along with accretion and amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, which are recorded over the remaining weighted average life of the security, are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income.\nWe regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other items, the time frame and extent to which the fair market value of a security is less than its amortized cost and our intent and ability to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The assumptions and judgments may change based on changes in our operations or future plans.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to various legal proceeding and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount. Most of these litigation matters are covered by insurance which contain deductibles, exclusions, claim limits and aggregate policy limits. While the ultimate liability for these legal proceeding cannot be determined, we use judgment in the evaluation claims and the need for accrual for loss contingencies quarterly. We record an accrual for litigation related losses where we determine the likelihood of loss is both probable and estimable. We accrue legal fees for litigation as the legal services are provided.\nLeases\nWe lease all of our facilities under operating lease agreements. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent or contain predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent. We recognize the minimum lease payments as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable term of the lease. We\nrecord the difference between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent obligation. We typically lease general purpose built-out office space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for improvements, net of incentives received, are recorded as prepaid rent. Prepaid rent is amortized using the straight-line method over the expected lease term as a charge to rent expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting
