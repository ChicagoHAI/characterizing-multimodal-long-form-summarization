Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the Company should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nBusiness Objectives and Outlook\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets.\nSince our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full-service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than $75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop\u201d lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContinue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2018\nTable 170: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Commercial and Residential Lending Segment originated or acquired $1.6 billion of commercial loans, CMBS, and preferred equity during the period, including the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$263.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 44-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $230.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$213.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a 555-unit, multifamily community in Boston, Massachusetts, of which we funded $11.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$210.4 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a corporate headquarters which is fully pre-leased to an investment grade tenant located in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of which we funded $22.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$170.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 21-story multifamily conversion, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of which we funded $107.6 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$149.4 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on a 22-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $103.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFunded $145.2 million of previously originated loan commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReceived gross proceeds of $805.9 million (net proceeds of $474.4 million) from maturities, sales and principal repayments on loans held-for-investment, single-borrower CMBS and preferred equity interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReceived proceeds of $286.8 million, including retained RMBS of $45.2 million, from the securitization of $279.9 million of residential mortgage loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSold commercial real estate within the Property Segment for total gross proceeds of $179.8 million and recognized net gains of $21.6 million.

The business includes $2.1 billion of funded senior secured project finance loans and investment securities and $466.3 million of unfunded lending commitments (the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio\u201d) which are secured primarily by natural gas and renewable power facilities. The Infrastructure Lending Portfolio is 97% floating rate with 74% of the collateral located in the U.S., 12% in Mexico, 5% in the United Kingdom and the remaining collateral dispersed through the Middle East, Ireland, Australia, Canada and Spain. The loans are predominantly denominated in USD and backed by long term power purchase agreements primarily with investment grade counterparties. The Company hired a team of professionals from GE Capital's project finance division in connection with the acquisition to manage and expand the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio. We utilized $1.7 billion in new financing in order to fund the acquisition.\nWoodstar II Portfolio Acquisition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired the final 19 properties of the 27 affordable housing communities comprising our Woodstar II Portfolio\u201d. These properties consist of 4,369 units and were acquired for $438.1 million, including contingent consideration of $29.2 million. Government sponsored mortgage debt of $27.0 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.06% and remaining weighted average terms of 27.5 years was assumed at closing. We financed these acquisitions utilizing new 10-year mortgage debt totaling $300.9 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.82%. The Woodstar II Portfolio is comprised of 6,109 units concentrated primarily in Central and South Florida and is 100% occupied.\nOther Developments\nTable 184: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Commercial and Residential Lending Segment originated or acquired $6.0 billion of commercial loans, CMBS, and preferred equity during the year, including the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$385.0 million mezzanine loan on a 2,900-room resort in Nassau, Bahamas, which we fully funded at acquisition and subsequently sold a $142.5 million subordinate interest through a single-asset securitization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$375.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on a 10-property hotel portfolio located in California, Colorado, and Florida, of which we funded $375.0 million, sold the most subordinated $50.0 million position in the mezzanine loan and securitized the $225.0 million first mortgage, of which we retained $46.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$277.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a 66-story condominium tower located in Long Island City, New York of which we funded $55.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$263.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 44-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $230.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$239.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition of a nine-property office portfolio located in Manhattan's Upper West Side, which we fully funded.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$214.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition of a 1.2 million square foot Class A office tower located in Houston, Texas, of which we funded $118.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFunded $539.0 million of previously originated loan commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReceived gross proceeds of $3.6 billion (net proceeds of $2.1 billion) from maturities, sales and principal repayments on loans held-for-investment, single-borrower CMBS and preferred equity interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReceived proceeds of $516.1 million from single-asset securitizations of commercial loans, net of retained interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReceived proceeds of $15.1 million from a profit participation associated with a previously repaid loan, which was recognized as interest income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReceived proceeds of $676.5 million, including retained RMBS of $91.0 million, from the securitization of $654.0 million residential mortgage loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSold commercial real estate within the Property Segment for total gross proceeds of $235.4 million and recognized net gains of $28.5 million.

December 31, 2018, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $80.0 million to $627.9 million, compared to $547.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.3 million increase in interest income from investment securities. The increased interest income from loans was principally due to (i) increased LIBOR rates, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets, (ii) higher average balances of both commercial loans and residential loans held-for-sale and (iii) income received in 2018 from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by (iv) lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $99.5 million to $226.6 million, compared to $127.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $53.6 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio, (ii) a $40.3 million net increase in our loan loss allowance principally relating to impairment charges on certain commercial loans (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding these individual loan impairments) and (iii) a $6.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n576,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76,758\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,353\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(160,769)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,167)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53,602)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n465,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,509\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $26.5 million to $465.9 million, compared to $439.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase reflects the net increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's loans and investment securities were as follows:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOverall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the overall weighted average unlevered yield is primarily due to increases in LIBOR and the loan profit participation income received in 2018, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets and lower levels of prepayment related income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 4.3% and 3.8%, respectively, and 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge\nfinancing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $4.5 million to $8.6 million, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $52.9 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $41.5 million unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The favorable change from derivatives reflects favorable changes of $52.2 million on foreign currency hedges and $0.7 million on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The favorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2018 versus a weakening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2017. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings, which fund fixed rate investments.\nInfrastructure Lending Segment\nThe Infrastructure Lending Segment was initially acquired on September 19, 2018 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Accordingly, the following discussion reflects its results for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2018 and includes no comparison to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues\nRevenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were $30.7 million, including interest income of $29.0 million from loans and $1.1 million from investment securities.\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were $33.4 million, consisting of $20.9 million of interest expense on the debt facility used to finance a portion of the acquisition price and subsequent loan fundings, $6.8 million of acquisition costs, and $5.6 million of general and administrative expenses. Acquisition costs include a $3.0 million commitment fee related to an unused bridge financing facility and legal and due diligence costs of $3.8 million.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,995\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,095\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20,949)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,141\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income from infrastructure loans and investment securities and interest expense on the term loan reflect primarily variable LIBOR based rates.

The weighted average secured borrowing rate on its debt facility, including amortization of deferred financing fees, was 4.7%.\nOther Income\nOther income of our Infrastructure Lending Segment was $0.4 million, consisting of a $1.8 million gain on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by $1.4 million in foreign currency losses on principally GBP and Euro-denominated loans.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGain (loss) on derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfinancial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincome taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,144\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(951)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,981\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,884)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,372\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(116)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,357\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,474)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,347\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,325)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n93,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,402\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the above-referenced Property Segment portfolios.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Property Segment increased $93.8 million to $292.9 million, compared to $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the fuller inclusion of rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio, which was acquired in September 2017, and the Woodstar II Portfolio, which was acquired over a period between December 2017 and September 2018.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $95.0 million to $292.5 million, compared to $197.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $37.1 million in depreciation and amortization, $27.4 million in other rental related costs and $28.6 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the fuller inclusion of the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio, both of which were acquired after August 2017.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Property Segment increased $112.6 million to $52.7 million, compared to a loss of $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $55.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, (ii) a $31.3 million favorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and (iii) $28.5 million of gains on sales of seven properties from the Master Lease Portfolio. The $55.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives reflects a $47.1 million favorable change on foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and an $8.0 million favorable change on interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. The $31.3 million favorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities principally reflects the recognition in 2017 of $34.7 million of unfavorable changes in fair value of our equity investment in four regional shopping malls (the Retail Fund\u201d), which is an investment company that measures its assets at fair value.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $7.7 million to $304.5 million, compared to $312.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to decreases of $7.6 million in CMBS interest income and $7.3 million in servicing fees, partially offset by a $6.7 million increase in rental income on our REIS Equity Portfolio (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $4.0 million to $161.6 million, compared to $157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in interest expense and $5.4 million in costs of rental operations associated with our REIS Equity Portfolio, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflecting lower profit-based compensation, headcount and corporate expense allocations.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $81.4 million to $94.6 million, from $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a $64.4 million decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities, (ii) a $21.1 million lesser increase in the fair value of CMBS investments and (iii) a $17.3 million lesser increase in the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale, partially offset by (iv) a $15.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights primarily reflecting the expected reduction in amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts and (v) a $6.1 million increase in gains on sales of operating properties. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities primarily reflects $53.9 million of non-recurring income during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company.\nCorporate and Other Items\nCorporate Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate expenses increased $10.2 million to $263.7 million, compared to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $6.7 million increase in management fees, (ii) a $1.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses and (iii) a $1.6 million increase in interest expense principally on our unsecured senior notes.\nCorporate Other Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate other loss increased $2.8 million to $9.4 million, compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to a $4.9 million increased loss on interest rate swaps used to hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes, which are used to repay variable rate secured financing, partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nSecuritization VIE Eliminations\nSecuritization VIE eliminations primarily reclassify interest income and servicing fee revenues to other income for the CMBS and RMBS VIEs that we consolidate as primary beneficiary. Such eliminations have no overall effect on net income attributable to Starwood Property Trust. The reclassified revenues, along with applicable changes in fair value of investment securities and servicing rights, comprise the other income caption Change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs,\u201d which represents our beneficial interest in those consolidated VIEs. The magnitude of the\nsecuritization VIE eliminations is merely a function of the number of CMBS and RMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of operating results. The eliminations primarily relate to CMBS trusts for which the Investing and Servicing Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary and, to a much lesser extent beginning in 2018, some CMBS and RMBS trusts for which the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our income tax provision decreased $16.2 million to $15.3 million, compared to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily reflects (i) the effect of a lower statutory tax rate in 2018 and (ii) the absence of the additional tax expense in 2017 that resulted from a taxable gain on the disposition of an interest in an investee entity, partially offset by (iii) the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 and (iv) additional tax expense in 2018 as a result of taxable gains in our TRSs from sales of operating properties that had been held in our Master Lease Portfolio and REIS Equity Portfolio.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $13.4 million to $25.4 million, compared to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of non-controlling interests in our Woodstar II Portfolio, which consists of properties acquired in and after December 2017, partially offset by the effect of non-controlling interests in a non-recurring gain of a consolidated VIE during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $50.2 million to $547.9 million, compared to $497.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans principally due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $13.3 million to $127.1 million, compared to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $3.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by a $9.2 million decrease in our loan loss allowance.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n449,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,336\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(531)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,167)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19,167)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,638\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $30.6 million to $439.3 million, compared to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects the increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the overall weighted average unlevered yield on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's loans and investment securities was 7.5%. The weighted average unlevered yield remained unchanged primarily due to the benefits of increases in LIBOR, which offset lower levels of prepayment related income and the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased $5.1 million to $4.1 million, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $76.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $71.2 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The unfavorable change from derivatives reflects a $77.6 million unfavorable change on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by a $0.8 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The unfavorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings, which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGain (loss) on derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfinancial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincome taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,354)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,536\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25,443)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,525)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,012)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,384)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9,102)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,422)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,426)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(620)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(65,809)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(46,387)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(93,323)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Property Segment increased $84.5 million to $199.1 million, compared to $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the full year inclusion of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio, which was acquired in December 2016, and the Woodstar I Portfolio, which was acquired over a period from October 2015 through April 2016. Also contributing to the increase was rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio which was acquired on September 25, 2017. The first phase of our Woodstar II Portfolio was acquired on December 28, 2017, so such acquisition had little impact on revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $65.6 million to $197.5 million, compared to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $22.9 million in depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in other rental related costs and $24.5 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the full year inclusion of the Medical Office Portfolio and Woodstar I Portfolio and acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by lower amortization related to the Woodstar I Portfolio's in-place lease intangible asset, which is fully amortized, and a $7.5 million decrease in acquisition costs not capitalized.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (loss) of our Property Segment decreased $112.2 million to a loss of $59.9 million, compared to income of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other income (loss) was primarily due to (i) a $65.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives of which $38.7 million related to foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and $27.1 million related to interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, (ii) a $37.4 million unfavorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities due to decreases in fair value of the properties in the Retail Fund (see Notes 8 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) the non-recurrence of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain recognized on the Woodstar I Portfolio in the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $40.6 million to $312.2 million, compared to $352.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases of $33.8 million in servicing fees and $11.9 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $33.8 million decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business in October 2016 and lower domestic servicing fees. The $11.9 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries from asset liquidations by CMBS trusts.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $16.2 million to $157.6 million, compared to $173.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to a $26.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses principally reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower compensation costs, partially offset by increases of $4.4 million in costs of rental operations, $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.9 million in interest expense, all primarily related to our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $171.6 million to $176.0 million, compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $98.4 million favorable change in fair value of CMBS investments to an increase of $54.3 million compared to a decrease of $44.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (ii) a $53.9 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a $19.8 million gain on sale of five operating properties, (iv) a $12.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights reflecting the expected reduction in amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, all partially offset by (v) a $9.6 million lesser increase\nin the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale.\nCorporate and Other Items\nCorporate Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate expenses increased $22.3 million to $253.5 million, compared to $231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense principally on our 2021 Senior Notes issued in December 2016 and our 2025 Senior Notes issued in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our reduced term loan borrowings and our 2017 Convertible Notes which matured in October 2017, and (ii) a $5.0 million increase in management fees.\nCorporate Other Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate other loss increased $2.1 million to $6.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million decrease in other income, which included a reimbursement received related to a partnership guarantee arrangement in 2016, and (ii) a $2.4 million loss on an interest rate swap used to hedge the portion of our 2025 Senior Notes used to repay variable-rate secured financing, partially offset by (iii) a $2.8 million decreased loss on extinguishment of debt.\nSecuritization VIE Eliminations\nRefer to the preceding comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of the nature of securitization VIE eliminations.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our income tax provision increased $23.2 million to $31.5 million, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflects (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs associated with earnings from our interest in an investor entity, which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the year ended December 31, 2017, and (ii) an income tax provision of $10.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $9.5 million to $12.0 million, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to non-controlling interests in a non-recurring gain of a consolidated VIE.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnon-cash equity compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(ii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincentive fees due under our management agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndepreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iv)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(v)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nany unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(vi)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nany deductions for distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to (and expected by) its investors.\nHowever, the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs.\nThe weighted average diluted share count applied to Core Earnings for purposes of determining Core Earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) is computed using the GAAP diluted share count, adjusted for the following:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnvested stock awards - Currently, unvested stock awards are excluded from the denominator of GAAP EPS. The related compensation expense is also excluded from Core Earnings. In order to effectuate dilution from these awards in the Core Earnings computation, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to include these shares.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(ii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConvertible Notes - Conversion of our Convertible Notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Core Earnings, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to exclude the potential shares issuable upon conversion until a conversion occurs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubsidiary equity - The intent of the February 2018 amendment to our management agreement (the Amendment\u201d) is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. The Class A Units issued in connection with the acquisition of assets in our Woodstar II Portfolio are currently excluded from our GAAP diluted share count, with the subsidiary equity represented as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our GAAP balance sheet. Consistent with the Amendment, we adjust GAAP diluted share count to include these subsidiary units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Core EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n288,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n262,079 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241,794\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Unvested stock awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,469\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Woodstar II Class A Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Convertible Notes dilution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22,659)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,899)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,697)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n261,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,566\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe definition of Core Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Core Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Core Earnings became effective during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs a reminder, in 2015, we adjusted the calculation of Core Earnings related to the equity component of our convertible notes. We previously amortized the equity component of these instruments through interest expense for Core Earnings purposes, consistent with our GAAP treatment. However, for Core Earnings purposes, the amount is not considered realized until the earlier of (a) the entire issuance of the notes has been extinguished; or (b) the equity portion has been fully amortized via repurchases of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we extinguished a portion of our 2019 Notes, consisting of an unpaid principal balance of $263.4 million. The notes were extinguished with 12.4 million common shares and $25.5 million of cash, reflecting a premium to par of $33.4 million. The proportionate share of the premium which was settled in cash was first used to fully amortize the remaining equity portion of the notes, with the remaining amount recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt for Core Earnings purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss totaled $2.9 million. The corresponding GAAP loss was $2.1 million (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nIn March 2018, our 2018 Notes matured and were fully repaid in cash. The equity portion of the 2018 Notes had not been fully amortized. As a result, we reflected $10.0 million as a positive adjustment to Core Earnings, representing the $28.1 million equity balance recognized upon issuance of the 2018 Notes, net of $18.1 million in adjustments related to cumulative repurchases through the maturity date.\nThe following table summarizes our quarterly Core Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the years ended December 31,

Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $25.2 million, from $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $445.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $627.2 million, costs and expenses were $187.5 million and other income was $9.8 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.5 million increase in interest income from investment securities. The increased interest income from loans was principally due to (i) increased LIBOR rates, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets, (ii) higher average balances of both commercial loans and residential loans held-for-sale and (iii) income received in 2018 from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016, partially offset by (iv) lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $59.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $53.6 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and a $6.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nCore other income increased by $6.9 million, primarily due to a $24.3 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) and a $4.1 million increase in realized gains on sales of investments primarily from securitizations of residential loans held-for-sale, partially offset by a $23.1 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on foreign currency derivatives.\nInfrastructure Lending Segment\nThe Infrastructure Lending Segment had Core Earnings of $1.3 million for the period from the initial acquisition on September 19, 2018 through December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $30.7 million, costs and expenses were $29.1 million and other income (loss) was nominal.\nRevenues of $30.7 million included interest income of $29.0 million from loans and $1.1 million from investment securities.\nCosts and expenses of $29.1 million consisted of $20.9 million of interest expense on the debt facility used to finance a portion of the acquisition price and subsequent loan fundings, $5.2 million of general and administrative expenses and a $3.0 million acquisition-related commitment fee related to an unused bridge financing facility.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n33,160\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(900)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(647)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,568\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,165\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,559)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,821)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,686)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,135)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n122,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n75,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,652\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Property Segment's Core Earnings increased by $46.7 million, from $75.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $122.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $291.6 million, costs and expenses were $183.1 million and other income was $21.6 million.\nCore revenues increased by $94.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the fuller inclusion of rental income for the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio, both of which were acquired after August 2017.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $58.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $29.3 million and rental related costs of $27.4 million primarily relating to the fuller inclusion of the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio.\nCore other income increased by $18.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $23.1 million net gain on sale of seven properties in the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in equity in earnings recognized from our investment in the Retail Fund.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nThe Investing and Servicing Segment's Core Earnings decreased by $36.3 million, from $271.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $235.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $321.7 million, costs and expenses were $136.5 million, other income was $60.0 million, income tax provision was $4.7 million and the deduction of income attributable to non-controlling interests was $5.2 million.\nCore revenues decreased by $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases of $7.3 million in servicing fees and $4.6 million in interest income from our CMBS portfolio, partially offset by an increase of $7.0 million in rental income from our REIS Equity Portfolio. The treatment of CMBS interest income on a GAAP basis is complicated by our application of the ASC 810 consolidation rules. In an attempt to treat these securities similar to the trust's other investment securities, we compute core interest income pursuant to an effective yield methodology. In doing so, we segregate the portfolio into various categories based on the components of the bonds' cash flows and the volatility related to each of these components. We then accrete interest income on an effective yield basis using the components of cash flows that are reliably estimable. Other minor adjustments are made to reflect management's expectations for other components of the projected cash flow stream.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in interest expense and $5.3 million in costs of rental operations associated with our REIS Equity Portfolio, partially offset by an $11.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflecting lower profit-based compensation, headcount and corporate expense allocations.\nCore other income includes profit realized upon securitization of loans by our conduit business, gains on sales of CMBS and operating properties, gains and losses on derivatives that were either effectively terminated or novated, and earnings from unconsolidated entities. These items are typically offset by a decrease in the fair value of our domestic servicing rights intangible which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset, net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts. Derivatives include instruments which hedge interest rate risk and credit risk on our conduit loans. For GAAP purposes, the loans, CMBS and derivatives are accounted for at fair value, with all changes in fair value (realized or unrealized) recognized in earnings. The adjustments to Core Earnings outlined above are also applied to the GAAP earnings of our unconsolidated entities. Core other income decreased by $54.4 million principally due to decreases of $52.8 million in earnings from unconsolidated entities and $18.8 million in realized gains on conduit loans, partially offset by a $15.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities reflects a $52.4 million realized gain in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during that year.\nIncome taxes, which principally relate to the operating results of our servicing and conduit businesses which are held in TRSs, decreased $25.9 million due to (i) a decrease in the taxable income of our TRSs, which during the year ended December 31, 2017 included the realized gain related to the unconsolidated investor entity which sold nearly all of its interest in an online real estate company, (ii) the non-recurring impact in 2017 of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a (iii) a lower statutory tax rate in 2018.\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests increased $1.8 million primarily due to the increased minority investors' share of gains from operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCorporate\nCore corporate costs and expenses increased by $13.0 million, from $183.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $196.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $9.1 million decrease in core gains on extinguishment of debt and a $5.4 million increase in base management fees.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nThe Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $26.5 million, from $393.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Under these agreements, we sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty.

The sales, syndications or securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Sales, syndications or securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnsecured Senior Notes: We issue senior notes, some of which are convertible, to finance certain operating and investing activities of the Company.

There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have authorized 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2018, we had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and 224,340,448 shares of common stock available for issuance.\nRefer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our issuances of equity securities in recent years.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including other secured as well as unsecured forms of borrowing and sale of certain investment securities which no longer meet our return requirements.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities and Convertible Senior Notes\nIn September 2014, our board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of one year. Subsequent amendments to the repurchase program approved by our board of directors in December 2014, June 2015, January 2016 and February 2017 resulted in the program being (i) amended to increase maximum repurchases to $500.0 million, (ii) expanded to allow for the repurchase of our outstanding convertible senior notes under the program and (iii) extended through January 2019. Purchases made pursuant to the program are made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are discretionary and are subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $12.1 million of common stock and no convertible senior notes under the repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, we had $250.1 million of remaining capacity to repurchase common stock and/or convertible senior notes under the repurchase program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have relationships with unconsolidated entities and financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as VIEs. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our involvement in VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity and any unfunded capital commitments. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDividends\nWe intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed dividend history.\nThe tax treatment for our aggregate distributions per share of common stock paid with respect to the 2018 tax year is as follows:\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrdinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTaxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTaxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nQualified\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnrecaptured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNondividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSection 199A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecord Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayable Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividend Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1250 Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n12/29/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1/12/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3344 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2446\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3/30/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4/13/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n6/29/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7/13/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n9/28/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10/15/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1/15/2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.9364 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.5628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.1468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.4160\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo the extent that total dividends for the 2018 tax year exceeded 2018 taxable income, the portion of the fourth quarter dividend paid in January of 2019 that is equal to such excess is treated as a 2019 dividend for federal tax purposes.\nLeverage Policies\nWe employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our stockholders, or provide temporary liquidity. Leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing or indirect through originating, acquiring or retaining subordinated mortgages, B-Notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed, we intend, when possible, to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the Company of credit losses associated with any individual asset. In addition, we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements.\nThe amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. and European economy and commercial, residential and infrastructure markets, our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed 75% of total assets (as defined), as adjusted to remove the impact of bona-fide loan sales that are accounted for as financings and the consolidation of VIEs pursuant to GAAP. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt to assets ratio was 66.9%.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured financings (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,761,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n726,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,301,610 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,268,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,464,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnsecured senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,027,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,200,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured borrowings on transferred loans (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan funding commitments (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,011,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,208,233 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n739,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInfrastructure Lending Segment commitments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n409,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n383,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan purchase commitments (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,463,366 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,552,743 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,351,341 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,583,012 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,976,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents the contractual maturity of the respective credit facility, inclusive of available extension options.

We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. The following discussion describes the critical accounting estimates that apply to our operations and require complex management judgment. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoan Impairment\nWe evaluate each loan classified as held-for-investment for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we record an allowance through the provision for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nWe regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, the collateral's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the collateral's liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the collateral. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate or industry sector and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants.\nSignificant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. The loan loss allowance was $39.2 million as of December 31, 2018, which includes $38.2 million of impairment reserves on specific loans recorded during 2018 and a general loan loss allowance of $1.0 million based on our loan risk rating system.\nClassification and Impairment Evaluation of Investment Securities\nOur investment securities consist primarily of (i) RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, (ii) CMBS, infrastructure bonds and mandatorily redeemable preferred equity interests in commercial real estate entities which we expect to hold to maturity and (iii) CMBS and RMBS for which we have elected the fair value option. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at their fair value. For available-for-sale debt securities where we have not elected the fair value option, changes in fair value are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, rather than through earnings. We do not hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes.\nWhen the estimated fair value of a debt security for which we have not elected to apply the fair value option is less than its amortized cost, we consider whether there is other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) in the value of the security. An impairment is deemed an OTTI if (i) we intend to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis or (iii) we do not expect to recover our cost basis even if we do not\nintend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis. If the impairment is deemed to be an OTTI, the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the OTTI. If the OTTI has resulted from (i) our intention to sell the security, or (ii) our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value. Whereas, if the OTTI has resulted from our conclusion that we will not recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, only the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in earnings, and the portion of the loss related to other factors, such as changes in interest rates, continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Determining whether there is an OTTI may require us to exercise significant judgment and make significant assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimated cash flows, estimated prepayments, loss assumptions, and assumptions regarding changes in interest rates. As a result, actual OTTI losses could differ from reported amounts. Such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors, including (i) credit of the issuer or the borrowers, (ii) credit rating of the security, (iii) key terms of the security, (iv) performance of underlying loans, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, (v) the value of the collateral for underlying loans, (vi) the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors, and (vii) the historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for similar securities. As of December 31, 2018, we held $209.1 million of available-for-sale RMBS which had gross unrealized gains of $53.5 million and immaterial unrealized losses. We also had $644.1 million of held-to-maturity debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of $3.5 million and gross unrealized gains of $3.3 million as of December 31, 2018. We recognized no material OTTI charges against earnings with respect to our investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nValuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nWe measure our VIE assets and liabilities, mortgage-backed securities, derivative assets and liabilities, domestic servicing rights intangible asset and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value option at fair value. When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the various methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $54.5 billion and $52.2 billion of financial assets and liabilities, respectively, that are measured at fair value, including $53.4 billion of VIE assets and $52.2 billion of VIE liabilities we consolidate pursuant to ASC 810.\nWe measure the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs at fair value pursuant to our election of the fair value option. The VIEs in which we invest are static\u201d; that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the VIE, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. As a result, the methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of our VIEs affect our earnings only to the extent of their impact on our direct investment in the VIEs.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill at December 31, 2018 of $259.8 million represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of LNR in April 2013 and the Infrastructure Lending Segment in September 2018 and October 2018. In testing goodwill for impairment, we follow ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which permits a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is determined to exist for the reporting unit. However, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, we compare the fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill ( Step One\u201d). If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired with the impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nBased on our qualitative assessments during the fourth quarter of 2018, we believe that the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which the LNR acquisition goodwill was attributed is not currently at risk of failing Step One of the impairment test. This qualitative assessment required judgment to be applied in evaluating the effects of multiple factors, including actual and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and relevant entity specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The first annual goodwill impairment test for the recently-acquired Infrastructure Lending Segment will occur in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is expected to require the application of similar judgment.\nProperty Impairment\nWe review properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the property to the undiscounted future net cash flows it is expected to generate. If such carrying amount exceeds the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we adjust the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value. The estimation of future net cash flows and fair values of our properties involves significant judgments by our management, and changes to these judgments could significantly impact our reported results of operation. As of December 31, 2018 we held properties with a carrying value of $2.8 billion, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or each reporting period for certain cost method investments. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. As of December 31, 2018, we held investments in unconsolidated entities with a carrying value of $171.8 million, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and the expected impact to the Company.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the Company should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nBusiness Objectives and Outlook\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets.\nSince our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full-service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities:\n (1) Continue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than $75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop\u201d lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators; \n (2) Continue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing; \n (3) Continue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing; \n (4) Continue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; and \n (5) Expand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance. \nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2018\n \u00b7 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment originated or acquired $1.6 billion of commercial loans, CMBS, and preferred equity during the period, including the following: \n o $263.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 44-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $230.8 million. \n o $213.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a 555-unit, multifamily community in Boston, Massachusetts, of which we funded $11.3 million. \n o $210.4 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a corporate headquarters which is fully pre-leased to an investment grade tenant located in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of which we funded $22.4 million. \n o $170.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 21-story multifamily conversion, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of which we funded $107.6 million. \n o $149.4 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on a 22-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $103.7 million. \n \u00b7 Funded $145.2 million of previously originated loan commitments. \n \u00b7 Received gross proceeds of $805.9 million (net proceeds of $474.4 million) from maturities, sales and principal repayments on loans held-for-investment, single-borrower CMBS and preferred equity interests. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $286.8 million, including retained RMBS of $45.2 million, from the securitization of $279.9 million of residential mortgage loans. \n \u00b7 Sold commercial real estate within the Property Segment for total gross proceeds of $179.8 million and recognized net gains of $21.6 million.

The business includes $2.1 billion of funded senior secured project finance loans and investment securities and $466.3 million of unfunded lending commitments (the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio\u201d) which are secured primarily by natural gas and renewable power facilities. The Infrastructure Lending Portfolio is 97% floating rate with 74% of the collateral located in the U.S., 12% in Mexico, 5% in the United Kingdom and the remaining collateral dispersed through the Middle East, Ireland, Australia, Canada and Spain. The loans are predominantly denominated in USD and backed by long term power purchase agreements primarily with investment grade counterparties. The Company hired a team of professionals from GE Capital's project finance division in connection with the acquisition to manage and expand the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio. We utilized $1.7 billion in new financing in order to fund the acquisition.\nWoodstar II Portfolio Acquisition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired the final 19 properties of the 27 affordable housing communities comprising our Woodstar II Portfolio\u201d. These properties consist of 4,369 units and were acquired for $438.1 million, including contingent consideration of $29.2 million. Government sponsored mortgage debt of $27.0 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.06% and remaining weighted average terms of 27.5 years was assumed at closing. We financed these acquisitions utilizing new 10-year mortgage debt totaling $300.9 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.82%. The Woodstar II Portfolio is comprised of 6,109 units concentrated primarily in Central and South Florida and is 100% occupied.\nOther Developments\n \u00b7 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment originated or acquired $6.0 billion of commercial loans, CMBS, and preferred equity during the year, including the following: \n o $385.0 million mezzanine loan on a 2,900-room resort in Nassau, Bahamas, which we fully funded at acquisition and subsequently sold a $142.5 million subordinate interest through a single-asset securitization. \n o $375.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on a 10-property hotel portfolio located in California, Colorado, and Florida, of which we funded $375.0 million, sold the most subordinated $50.0 million position in the mezzanine loan and securitized the $225.0 million first mortgage, of which we retained $46.2 million. \n o $277.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a 66-story condominium tower located in Long Island City, New York of which we funded $55.0 million. \n o $263.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 44-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $230.8 million. \n o $239.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition of a nine-property office portfolio located in Manhattan's Upper West Side, which we fully funded. \n o $214.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition of a 1.2 million square foot Class A office tower located in Houston, Texas, of which we funded $118.0 million. \n \u00b7 Funded $539.0 million of previously originated loan commitments. \n \u00b7 Received gross proceeds of $3.6 billion (net proceeds of $2.1 billion) from maturities, sales and principal repayments on loans held-for-investment, single-borrower CMBS and preferred equity interests. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $516.1 million from single-asset securitizations of commercial loans, net of retained interests. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $15.1 million from a profit participation associated with a previously repaid loan, which was recognized as interest income. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $676.5 million, including retained RMBS of $91.0 million, from the securitization of $654.0 million residential mortgage loans. \n \u00b7 Sold commercial real estate within the Property Segment for total gross proceeds of $235.4 million and recognized net gains of $28.5 million.

December 31, 2018, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $80.0 million to $627.9 million, compared to $547.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.3 million increase in interest income from investment securities. The increased interest income from loans was principally due to (i) increased LIBOR rates, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets, (ii) higher average balances of both commercial loans and residential loans held-for-sale and (iii) income received in 2018 from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by (iv) lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $99.5 million to $226.6 million, compared to $127.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $53.6 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio, (ii) a $40.3 million net increase in our loan loss allowance principally relating to impairment charges on certain commercial loans (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding these individual loan impairments) and (iii) a $6.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n576,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76,758\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,353\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(160,769)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,167)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53,602)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n465,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,509\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $26.5 million to $465.9 million, compared to $439.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase reflects the net increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's loans and investment securities were as follows:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOverall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the overall weighted average unlevered yield is primarily due to increases in LIBOR and the loan profit participation income received in 2018, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets and lower levels of prepayment related income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 4.3% and 3.8%, respectively, and 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge\nfinancing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $4.5 million to $8.6 million, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $52.9 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $41.5 million unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The favorable change from derivatives reflects favorable changes of $52.2 million on foreign currency hedges and $0.7 million on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The favorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2018 versus a weakening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2017. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings, which fund fixed rate investments.\nInfrastructure Lending Segment\nThe Infrastructure Lending Segment was initially acquired on September 19, 2018 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Accordingly, the following discussion reflects its results for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2018 and includes no comparison to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues\nRevenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were $30.7 million, including interest income of $29.0 million from loans and $1.1 million from investment securities.\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were $33.4 million, consisting of $20.9 million of interest expense on the debt facility used to finance a portion of the acquisition price and subsequent loan fundings, $6.8 million of acquisition costs, and $5.6 million of general and administrative expenses.

The weighted average secured borrowing rate on its debt facility, including amortization of deferred financing fees, was 4.7%.\nOther Income\nOther income of our Infrastructure Lending Segment was $0.4 million, consisting of a $1.8 million gain on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by $1.4 million in foreign currency losses on principally GBP and Euro-denominated loans.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGain (loss) on derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfinancial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincome taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,144\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(951)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,981\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,884)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,372\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(116)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,357\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,474)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,347\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,325)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n93,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,402\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the above-referenced Property Segment portfolios.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Property Segment increased $93.8 million to $292.9 million, compared to $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the fuller inclusion of rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio, which was acquired in September 2017, and the Woodstar II Portfolio, which was acquired over a period between December 2017 and September 2018.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $95.0 million to $292.5 million, compared to $197.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $37.1 million in depreciation and amortization, $27.4 million in other rental related costs and $28.6 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the fuller inclusion of the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio, both of which were acquired after August 2017.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Property Segment increased $112.6 million to $52.7 million, compared to a loss of $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $55.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, (ii) a $31.3 million favorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and (iii) $28.5 million of gains on sales of seven properties from the Master Lease Portfolio. The $55.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives reflects a $47.1 million favorable change on foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and an $8.0 million favorable change on interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. The $31.3 million favorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities principally reflects the recognition in 2017 of $34.7 million of unfavorable changes in fair value of our equity investment in four regional shopping malls (the Retail Fund\u201d), which is an investment company that measures its assets at fair value.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $7.7 million to $304.5 million, compared to $312.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to decreases of $7.6 million in CMBS interest income and $7.3 million in servicing fees, partially offset by a $6.7 million increase in rental income on our REIS Equity Portfolio (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $4.0 million to $161.6 million, compared to $157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in interest expense and $5.4 million in costs of rental operations associated with our REIS Equity Portfolio, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflecting lower profit-based compensation, headcount and corporate expense allocations.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $81.4 million to $94.6 million, from $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a $64.4 million decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities, (ii) a $21.1 million lesser increase in the fair value of CMBS investments and (iii) a $17.3 million lesser increase in the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale, partially offset by (iv) a $15.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights primarily reflecting the expected reduction in amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts and (v) a $6.1 million increase in gains on sales of operating properties. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities primarily reflects $53.9 million of non-recurring income during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company.\nCorporate and Other Items\nCorporate Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate expenses increased $10.2 million to $263.7 million, compared to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $6.7 million increase in management fees, (ii) a $1.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses and (iii) a $1.6 million increase in interest expense principally on our unsecured senior notes.\nCorporate Other Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate other loss increased $2.8 million to $9.4 million, compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to a $4.9 million increased loss on interest rate swaps used to hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes, which are used to repay variable rate secured financing, partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nSecuritization VIE Eliminations\nSecuritization VIE eliminations primarily reclassify interest income and servicing fee revenues to other income for the CMBS and RMBS VIEs that we consolidate as primary beneficiary. Such eliminations have no overall effect on net income attributable to Starwood Property Trust. The reclassified revenues, along with applicable changes in fair value of investment securities and servicing rights, comprise the other income caption Change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs,\u201d which represents our beneficial interest in those consolidated VIEs. The magnitude of the\nsecuritization VIE eliminations is merely a function of the number of CMBS and RMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of operating results. The eliminations primarily relate to CMBS trusts for which the Investing and Servicing Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary and, to a much lesser extent beginning in 2018, some CMBS and RMBS trusts for which the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our income tax provision decreased $16.2 million to $15.3 million, compared to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily reflects (i) the effect of a lower statutory tax rate in 2018 and (ii) the absence of the additional tax expense in 2017 that resulted from a taxable gain on the disposition of an interest in an investee entity, partially offset by (iii) the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 and (iv) additional tax expense in 2018 as a result of taxable gains in our TRSs from sales of operating properties that had been held in our Master Lease Portfolio and REIS Equity Portfolio.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $13.4 million to $25.4 million, compared to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of non-controlling interests in our Woodstar II Portfolio, which consists of properties acquired in and after December 2017, partially offset by the effect of non-controlling interests in a non-recurring gain of a consolidated VIE during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $50.2 million to $547.9 million, compared to $497.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans principally due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $13.3 million to $127.1 million, compared to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $3.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by a $9.2 million decrease in our loan loss allowance.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n449,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,336\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(531)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(107,167)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19,167)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n439,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,638\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $30.6 million to $439.3 million, compared to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects the increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the overall weighted average unlevered yield on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's loans and investment securities was 7.5%. The weighted average unlevered yield remained unchanged primarily due to the benefits of increases in LIBOR, which offset lower levels of prepayment related income and the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased $5.1 million to $4.1 million, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $76.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $71.2 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The unfavorable change from derivatives reflects a $77.6 million unfavorable change on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by a $0.8 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The unfavorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings, which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change from prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGain (loss) on derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome (loss) before\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfinancial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincome taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,354)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,536\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25,443)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,525)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,012)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,384)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9,102)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,422)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37,426)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(620)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(65,809)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(46,387)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(93,323)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Property Segment increased $84.5 million to $199.1 million, compared to $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the full year inclusion of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio, which was acquired in December 2016, and the Woodstar I Portfolio, which was acquired over a period from October 2015 through April 2016. Also contributing to the increase was rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio which was acquired on September 25, 2017. The first phase of our Woodstar II Portfolio was acquired on December 28, 2017, so such acquisition had little impact on revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $65.6 million to $197.5 million, compared to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $22.9 million in depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in other rental related costs and $24.5 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the full year inclusion of the Medical Office Portfolio and Woodstar I Portfolio and acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by lower amortization related to the Woodstar I Portfolio's in-place lease intangible asset, which is fully amortized, and a $7.5 million decrease in acquisition costs not capitalized.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (loss) of our Property Segment decreased $112.2 million to a loss of $59.9 million, compared to income of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other income (loss) was primarily due to (i) a $65.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives of which $38.7 million related to foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and $27.1 million related to interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, (ii) a $37.4 million unfavorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities due to decreases in fair value of the properties in the Retail Fund (see Notes 8 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) the non-recurrence of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain recognized on the Woodstar I Portfolio in the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $40.6 million to $312.2 million, compared to $352.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases of $33.8 million in servicing fees and $11.9 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $33.8 million decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business in October 2016 and lower domestic servicing fees. The $11.9 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries from asset liquidations by CMBS trusts.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $16.2 million to $157.6 million, compared to $173.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to a $26.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses principally reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower compensation costs, partially offset by increases of $4.4 million in costs of rental operations, $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.9 million in interest expense, all primarily related to our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $171.6 million to $176.0 million, compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $98.4 million favorable change in fair value of CMBS investments to an increase of $54.3 million compared to a decrease of $44.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (ii) a $53.9 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a $19.8 million gain on sale of five operating properties, (iv) a $12.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights reflecting the expected reduction in amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, all partially offset by (v) a $9.6 million lesser increase\nin the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale.\nCorporate and Other Items\nCorporate Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate expenses increased $22.3 million to $253.5 million, compared to $231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense principally on our 2021 Senior Notes issued in December 2016 and our 2025 Senior Notes issued in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our reduced term loan borrowings and our 2017 Convertible Notes which matured in October 2017, and (ii) a $5.0 million increase in management fees.\nCorporate Other Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate other loss increased $2.1 million to $6.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million decrease in other income, which included a reimbursement received related to a partnership guarantee arrangement in 2016, and (ii) a $2.4 million loss on an interest rate swap used to hedge the portion of our 2025 Senior Notes used to repay variable-rate secured financing, partially offset by (iii) a $2.8 million decreased loss on extinguishment of debt.\nSecuritization VIE Eliminations\nRefer to the preceding comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of the nature of securitization VIE eliminations.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our income tax provision increased $23.2 million to $31.5 million, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflects (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs associated with earnings from our interest in an investor entity, which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the year ended December 31, 2017, and (ii) an income tax provision of $10.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $9.5 million to $12.0 million, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to non-controlling interests in a non-recurring gain of a consolidated VIE.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following:\n (i) non-cash equity compensation expense; \n (ii) incentive fees due under our management agreement; \nTable 213: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndepreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (iv) acquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions; \n (v) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income; and \n (vi) any deductions for distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein. \nWe believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to (and expected by) its investors.\nHowever, the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs.\nThe weighted average diluted share count applied to Core Earnings for purposes of determining Core Earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) is computed using the GAAP diluted share count, adjusted for the following:\n (i) Unvested stock awards - Currently, unvested stock awards are excluded from the denominator of GAAP EPS. The related compensation expense is also excluded from Core Earnings. In order to effectuate dilution from these awards in the Core Earnings computation, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to include these shares. \n (ii) Convertible Notes - Conversion of our Convertible Notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Core Earnings, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to exclude the potential shares issuable upon conversion until a conversion occurs. \n (iii) Subsidiary equity - The intent of the February 2018 amendment to our management agreement (the Amendment\u201d) is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. The Class A Units issued in connection with the acquisition of assets in our Woodstar II Portfolio are currently excluded from our GAAP diluted share count, with the subsidiary equity represented as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our GAAP balance sheet. Consistent with the Amendment, we adjust GAAP diluted share count to include these subsidiary units. \nThe following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Core EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n288,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n262,079 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241,794\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Unvested stock awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,469\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Woodstar II Class A Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Convertible Notes dilution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22,659)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,899)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,697)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares - Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n277,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n261,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,566\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe definition of Core Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Core Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Core Earnings became effective during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs a reminder, in 2015, we adjusted the calculation of Core Earnings related to the equity component of our convertible notes. We previously amortized the equity component of these instruments through interest expense for Core Earnings purposes, consistent with our GAAP treatment. However, for Core Earnings purposes, the amount is not considered realized until the earlier of (a) the entire issuance of the notes has been extinguished; or (b) the equity portion has been fully amortized via repurchases of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we extinguished a portion of our 2019 Notes, consisting of an unpaid principal balance of $263.4 million. The notes were extinguished with 12.4 million common shares and $25.5 million of cash, reflecting a premium to par of $33.4 million. The proportionate share of the premium which was settled in cash was first used to fully amortize the remaining equity portion of the notes, with the remaining amount recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt for Core Earnings purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss totaled $2.9 million. The corresponding GAAP loss was $2.1 million (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nIn March 2018, our 2018 Notes matured and were fully repaid in cash. The equity portion of the 2018 Notes had not been fully amortized. As a result, we reflected $10.0 million as a positive adjustment to Core Earnings, representing the $28.1 million equity balance recognized upon issuance of the 2018 Notes, net of $18.1 million in adjustments related to cumulative repurchases through the maturity date.\nThe following table summarizes our quarterly Core Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the years ended December 31,

Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $25.2 million, from $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $445.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $627.2 million, costs and expenses were $187.5 million and other income was $9.8 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.5 million increase in interest income from investment securities. The increased interest income from loans was principally due to (i) increased LIBOR rates, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets, (ii) higher average balances of both commercial loans and residential loans held-for-sale and (iii) income received in 2018 from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016, partially offset by (iv) lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $59.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $53.6 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and a $6.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nCore other income increased by $6.9 million, primarily due to a $24.3 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) and a $4.1 million increase in realized gains on sales of investments primarily from securitizations of residential loans held-for-sale, partially offset by a $23.1 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on foreign currency derivatives.\nInfrastructure Lending Segment\nThe Infrastructure Lending Segment had Core Earnings of $1.3 million for the period from the initial acquisition on September 19, 2018 through December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $30.7 million, costs and expenses were $29.1 million and other income (loss) was nominal.\nRevenues of $30.7 million included interest income of $29.0 million from loans and $1.1 million from investment securities.\nCosts and expenses of $29.1 million consisted of $20.9 million of interest expense on the debt facility used to finance a portion of the acquisition price and subsequent loan fundings, $5.2 million of general and administrative expenses and a $3.0 million acquisition-related commitment fee related to an unused bridge financing facility.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n33,160\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(900)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(647)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,568\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,165\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,559)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,821)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,686)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,135)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n122,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n75,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,652\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Property Segment's Core Earnings increased by $46.7 million, from $75.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $122.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $291.6 million, costs and expenses were $183.1 million and other income was $21.6 million.\nCore revenues increased by $94.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the fuller inclusion of rental income for the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio, both of which were acquired after August 2017.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $58.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $29.3 million and rental related costs of $27.4 million primarily relating to the fuller inclusion of the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio.\nCore other income increased by $18.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $23.1 million net gain on sale of seven properties in the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in equity in earnings recognized from our investment in the Retail Fund.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nThe Investing and Servicing Segment's Core Earnings decreased by $36.3 million, from $271.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $235.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $321.7 million, costs and expenses were $136.5 million, other income was $60.0 million, income tax provision was $4.7 million and the deduction of income attributable to non-controlling interests was $5.2 million.\nCore revenues decreased by $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases of $7.3 million in servicing fees and $4.6 million in interest income from our CMBS portfolio, partially offset by an increase of $7.0 million in rental income from our REIS Equity Portfolio. The treatment of CMBS interest income on a GAAP basis is complicated by our application of the ASC 810 consolidation rules. In an attempt to treat these securities similar to the trust's other investment securities, we compute core interest income pursuant to an effective yield methodology. In doing so, we segregate the portfolio into various categories based on the components of the bonds' cash flows and the volatility related to each of these components. We then accrete interest income on an effective yield basis using the components of cash flows that are reliably estimable. Other minor adjustments are made to reflect management's expectations for other components of the projected cash flow stream.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in interest expense and $5.3 million in costs of rental operations associated with our REIS Equity Portfolio, partially offset by an $11.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflecting lower profit-based compensation, headcount and corporate expense allocations.\nCore other income includes profit realized upon securitization of loans by our conduit business, gains on sales of CMBS and operating properties, gains and losses on derivatives that were either effectively terminated or novated, and earnings from unconsolidated entities. These items are typically offset by a decrease in the fair value of our domestic servicing rights intangible which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset, net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts. Derivatives include instruments which hedge interest rate risk and credit risk on our conduit loans. For GAAP purposes, the loans, CMBS and derivatives are accounted for at fair value, with all changes in fair value (realized or unrealized) recognized in earnings. The adjustments to Core Earnings outlined above are also applied to the GAAP earnings of our unconsolidated entities. Core other income decreased by $54.4 million principally due to decreases of $52.8 million in earnings from unconsolidated entities and $18.8 million in realized gains on conduit loans, partially offset by a $15.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities reflects a $52.4 million realized gain in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during that year.\nIncome taxes, which principally relate to the operating results of our servicing and conduit businesses which are held in TRSs, decreased $25.9 million due to (i) a decrease in the taxable income of our TRSs, which during the year ended December 31, 2017 included the realized gain related to the unconsolidated investor entity which sold nearly all of its interest in an online real estate company, (ii) the non-recurring impact in 2017 of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a (iii) a lower statutory tax rate in 2018.\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests increased $1.8 million primarily due to the increased minority investors' share of gains from operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCorporate\nCore corporate costs and expenses increased by $13.0 million, from $183.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $196.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $9.1 million decrease in core gains on extinguishment of debt and a $5.4 million increase in base management fees.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nThe Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $26.5 million, from $393.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $547.0 million, costs and expenses were $128.3 million and other income was $2.9 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by $50.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $1.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nCore other income decreased by $0.9 million.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaster Lease Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,111\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMedical Office Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,360\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,264)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar I Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,487\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWoodstar II Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,686)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther/Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,686)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,064)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(622)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n75,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,439\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Property Segment's Core Earnings increased by $29.4 million, from $46.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $75.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.

adjustments principally resulting from the consolidation of the securitization VIEs under ASC 810. These adjustments principally relate to (i) purchases of CMBS, RMBS, loans and real estate from consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as repayments of VIE debt on a GAAP basis and (ii) principal collections of CMBS and RMBS related to consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as VIE distributions on a GAAP basis. There is no significant net impact to cash flows from operations or to overall cash resulting from these consolidations. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $72.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of $588.1 million and net cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities of $2.7 billion.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $588.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to cash interest income of $515.3 million from our loan origination and conduit programs and cash interest income on investment securities of $162.3 million. Net rental income provided cash of $223.6 million and servicing fees provided cash of $110.8 million. Proceeds from principal collections and sales of loans held-for-sale, net of originations and purchases, provided cash of $141.8 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $13.8 million. Offsetting these cash inflows was cash interest expense of $337.6 million, general and administrative expenses of $143.9 million, management fees of $92.3 million and business combination costs of $8.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to the acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment for $2.2 billion, the origination and acquisition of new loans held-for-investment of $4.4 billion, the purchase of investment securities of $877.9 million and the purchase of properties and other assets of $82.5 million, partially offset by the proceeds received from principal collections and sales of loans of $3.9 billion, investment securities of $596.9 million and sale/recovery of properties of $311.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to borrowings on our secured debt, net of repayments and deferred loan costs, of $2.9 billion, including $1.7 billion to finance the acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment, and net borrowings after repayments of our unsecured debt of $97.5 million, partially offset by dividend distributions of $510.0 million and net distributions to non-controlling interests of $242.5 million. The net distributions to non-controlling interests were principally related to the 2018 closing of the Woodstar II Portfolio acquisition.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe utilize a variety of financing arrangements, including:\n 1) Repurchase Agreements: Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own. Under these agreements, we sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty. As of December 31, 2018, we had various repurchase agreements, with details referenced in the table provided below. \n 2) Secured Property Financings: We use long-term mortgage facilities from commercial lenders and government sponsors of affordable housing loans to finance many of the investment properties that we hold. These facilities accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We typically hedge our exposure to floating interest rate changes on these facilities through the use of interest rate swap and cap derivatives. \n 3) Bank Credit Facilities: We use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our assets. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. The lender retains the sole discretion, subject to certain conditions, over the market value of such note for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the lender. \n 4) Loan Sales, Syndications and Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from loan sales, syndications and/or securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans. The sales, syndications or securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Sales, syndications or securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question. \n 5) Unsecured Senior Notes: We issue senior notes, some of which are convertible, to finance certain operating and investing activities of the Company. These senior notes accrue interest at fixed interest rates and vary in tenure. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n 6) Federal Home Loan Bank Financing: As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, we have the ability to borrow funds from the FHLB of Chicago at both fixed and variable rates to finance eligible collateral, which includes residential mortgage loans. \nThe following table is a summary of our secured financing facilities

There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have authorized 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2018, we had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and 224,340,448 shares of common stock available for issuance.\nRefer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our issuances of equity securities in recent years.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including other secured as well as unsecured forms of borrowing and sale of certain investment securities which no longer meet our return requirements.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities and Convertible Senior Notes\nIn September 2014, our board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of one year. Subsequent amendments to the repurchase program approved by our board of directors in December 2014, June 2015, January 2016 and February 2017 resulted in the program being (i) amended to increase maximum repurchases to $500.0 million, (ii) expanded to allow for the repurchase of our outstanding convertible senior notes under the program and (iii) extended through January 2019. Purchases made pursuant to the program are made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are discretionary and are subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $12.1 million of common stock and no convertible senior notes under the repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, we had $250.1 million of remaining capacity to repurchase common stock and/or convertible senior notes under the repurchase program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have relationships with unconsolidated entities and financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as VIEs. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our involvement in VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity and any unfunded capital commitments. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDividends\nWe intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed dividend history.\nThe tax treatment for our aggregate distributions per share of common stock paid with respect to the 2018 tax year is as follows:\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOrdinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTaxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTaxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nQualified\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnrecaptured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNondividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSection 199A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecord Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayable Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividend Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1250 Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividends\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n12/29/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1/12/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3344 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2446\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3/30/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4/13/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n6/29/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7/13/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n9/28/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10/15/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1/15/2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.0006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.9364 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.5628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.1468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.3736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.0072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.4160\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo the extent that total dividends for the 2018 tax year exceeded 2018 taxable income, the portion of the fourth quarter dividend paid in January of 2019 that is equal to such excess is treated as a 2019 dividend for federal tax purposes.\nLeverage Policies\nWe employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our stockholders, or provide temporary liquidity. Leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing or indirect through originating, acquiring or retaining subordinated mortgages, B-Notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed, we intend, when possible, to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the Company of credit losses associated with any individual asset. In addition, we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements.\nThe amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. and European economy and commercial, residential and infrastructure markets, our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed 75% of total assets (as defined), as adjusted to remove the impact of bona-fide loan sales that are accounted for as financings and the consolidation of VIEs pursuant to GAAP. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt to assets ratio was 66.9%.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured financings (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,761,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n726,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,301,610 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,268,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,464,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnsecured senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,027,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,200,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured borrowings on transferred loans (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan funding commitments (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,011,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,208,233 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n739,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInfrastructure Lending Segment commitments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n409,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n383,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan purchase commitments (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,463,366 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,552,743 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,351,341 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,583,012 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,976,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Represents the contractual maturity of the respective credit facility, inclusive of available extension options.

We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. The following discussion describes the critical accounting estimates that apply to our operations and require complex management judgment. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoan Impairment\nWe evaluate each loan classified as held-for-investment for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we record an allowance through the provision for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nWe regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, the collateral's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the collateral's liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the collateral. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate or industry sector and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants.\nSignificant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. The loan loss allowance was $39.2 million as of December 31, 2018, which includes $38.2 million of impairment reserves on specific loans recorded during 2018 and a general loan loss allowance of $1.0 million based on our loan risk rating system.\nClassification and Impairment Evaluation of Investment Securities\nOur investment securities consist primarily of (i) RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, (ii) CMBS, infrastructure bonds and mandatorily redeemable preferred equity interests in commercial real estate entities which we expect to hold to maturity and (iii) CMBS and RMBS for which we have elected the fair value option. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at their fair value. For available-for-sale debt securities where we have not elected the fair value option, changes in fair value are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, rather than through earnings. We do not hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes.\nWhen the estimated fair value of a debt security for which we have not elected to apply the fair value option is less than its amortized cost, we consider whether there is other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) in the value of the security. An impairment is deemed an OTTI if (i) we intend to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis or (iii) we do not expect to recover our cost basis even if we do not\nintend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis. If the impairment is deemed to be an OTTI, the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the OTTI. If the OTTI has resulted from (i) our intention to sell the security, or (ii) our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value. Whereas, if the OTTI has resulted from our conclusion that we will not recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, only the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in earnings, and the portion of the loss related to other factors, such as changes in interest rates, continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Determining whether there is an OTTI may require us to exercise significant judgment and make significant assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimated cash flows, estimated prepayments, loss assumptions, and assumptions regarding changes in interest rates. As a result, actual OTTI losses could differ from reported amounts. Such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors, including (i) credit of the issuer or the borrowers, (ii) credit rating of the security, (iii) key terms of the security, (iv) performance of underlying loans, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, (v) the value of the collateral for underlying loans, (vi) the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors, and (vii) the historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for similar securities. As of December 31, 2018, we held $209.1 million of available-for-sale RMBS which had gross unrealized gains of $53.5 million and immaterial unrealized losses. We also had $644.1 million of held-to-maturity debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of $3.5 million and gross unrealized gains of $3.3 million as of December 31, 2018. We recognized no material OTTI charges against earnings with respect to our investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nValuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nWe measure our VIE assets and liabilities, mortgage-backed securities, derivative assets and liabilities, domestic servicing rights intangible asset and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value option at fair value. When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the various methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $54.5 billion and $52.2 billion of financial assets and liabilities, respectively, that are measured at fair value, including $53.4 billion of VIE assets and $52.2 billion of VIE liabilities we consolidate pursuant to ASC 810.\nWe measure the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs at fair value pursuant to our election of the fair value option. The VIEs in which we invest are static\u201d; that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the VIE, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. As a result, the methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of our VIEs affect our earnings only to the extent of their impact on our direct investment in the VIEs.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill at December 31, 2018 of $259.8 million represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of LNR in April 2013 and the Infrastructure Lending Segment in September 2018 and October 2018. In testing goodwill for impairment, we follow ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which permits a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is determined to exist for the reporting unit. However, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, we compare the fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill ( Step One\u201d). If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired with the impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nBased on our qualitative assessments during the fourth quarter of 2018, we believe that the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which the LNR acquisition goodwill was attributed is not currently at risk of failing Step One of the impairment test. This qualitative assessment required judgment to be applied in evaluating the effects of multiple factors, including actual and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and relevant entity specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The first annual goodwill impairment test for the recently-acquired Infrastructure Lending Segment will occur in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is expected to require the application of similar judgment.\nProperty Impairment\nWe review properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the property to the undiscounted future net cash flows it is expected to generate. If such carrying amount exceeds the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we adjust the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value. The estimation of future net cash flows and fair values of our properties involves significant judgments by our management, and changes to these judgments could significantly impact our reported results of operation. As of December 31, 2018 we held properties with a carrying value of $2.8 billion, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or each reporting period for certain cost method investments. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. As of December 31, 2018, we held investments in unconsolidated entities with a carrying value of $171.8 million, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and the expected impact to the Company.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of the Company should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nBusiness Objectives and Outlook\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve our objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets.\nSince our IPO in August 2009, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions of real estate debt assets from distressed sellers to that of a full-service real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate debt and equity investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the Starwood brand, market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, we are focused primarily on the following opportunities:\n (1) Continue to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects (greater than $75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a one-stop\u201d lending solution for real estate developers, owners and operators; \n (2) Continue to expand our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing; \n (3) Continue to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing; \n (4) Continue to leverage our Investing and Servicing Segment's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities to expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets; and \n (5) Expand our investment activities in both (i) targeted real estate equity investments and (ii) residential mortgage finance. \nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2018\n \u00b7 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment originated or acquired $1.6 billion of commercial loans, CMBS, and preferred equity during the period, including the following: \n o $263.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 44-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $230.8 million. \n o $213.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a 555-unit, multifamily community in Boston, Massachusetts, of which we funded $11.3 million. \n o $210.4 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a corporate headquarters which is fully pre-leased to an investment grade tenant located in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of which we funded $22.4 million. \n o $170.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 21-story multifamily conversion, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of which we funded $107.6 million. \n o $149.4 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on a 22-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $103.7 million. \n \u00b7 Funded $145.2 million of previously originated loan commitments. \n \u00b7 Received gross proceeds of $805.9 million (net proceeds of $474.4 million) from maturities, sales and principal repayments on loans held-for-investment, single-borrower CMBS and preferred equity interests. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $286.8 million, including retained RMBS of $45.2 million, from the securitization of $279.9 million of residential mortgage loans. \n \u00b7 Sold commercial real estate within the Property Segment for total gross proceeds of $179.8 million and recognized net gains of $21.6 million. Additionally, sold commercial real estate within the Investing and Servicing Segment for total gross proceeds of $29.2 million and recognized net gains of $7.0 million. \n \u00b7 Originated commercial conduit loans of $450.2 million. Separately, received proceeds of $709.4 million from sales of previously originated commercial conduit loans. \n \u00b7 Obtained eight new special servicing assignments for CMBS trusts with a total unpaid principal balance of $5.0 billion. \n \u00b7 Sold CMBS held by our Investing and Servicing Segment for total gross proceeds of $75.6 million and acquired CMBS for a purchase price of $65.2 million, net of non-controlling interests. \n \u00b7 Settled $27.9 million of redemption notices received on our 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes\u201d) through the issuance of 1.2 million shares and cash payments of $4.7 million, recognizing a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million. \nDevelopments During 2018\nInfrastructure Lending Segment Acquisition\nOn September 19, 2018 and October 15, 2018, we acquired the project finance origination, underwriting and capital markets business of GE Capital for approximately $2.2 billion (the Infrastructure Lending Segment\u201d). The business includes $2.1 billion of funded senior secured project finance loans and investment securities and $466.3 million of unfunded lending commitments (the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio\u201d) which are secured primarily by natural gas and renewable power facilities. The Infrastructure Lending Portfolio is 97% floating rate with 74% of the collateral located in the U.S., 12% in Mexico, 5% in the United Kingdom and the remaining collateral dispersed through the Middle East, Ireland, Australia, Canada and Spain. The loans are predominantly denominated in USD and backed by long term power purchase agreements primarily with investment grade counterparties. The Company hired a team of professionals from GE Capital's project finance division in connection with the acquisition to manage and expand the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio. We utilized $1.7 billion in new financing in order to fund the acquisition.\nWoodstar II Portfolio Acquisition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired the final 19 properties of the 27 affordable housing communities comprising our Woodstar II Portfolio\u201d. These properties consist of 4,369 units and were acquired for $438.1 million, including contingent consideration of $29.2 million. Government sponsored mortgage debt of $27.0 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.06% and remaining weighted average terms of 27.5 years was assumed at closing. We financed these acquisitions utilizing new 10-year mortgage debt totaling $300.9 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.82%. The Woodstar II Portfolio is comprised of 6,109 units concentrated primarily in Central and South Florida and is 100% occupied.\nOther Developments\n \u00b7 The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment originated or acquired $6.0 billion of commercial loans, CMBS, and preferred equity during the year, including the following: \n o $385.0 million mezzanine loan on a 2,900-room resort in Nassau, Bahamas, which we fully funded at acquisition and subsequently sold a $142.5 million subordinate interest through a single-asset securitization. \n o $375.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on a 10-property hotel portfolio located in California, Colorado, and Florida, of which we funded $375.0 million, sold the most subordinated $50.0 million position in the mezzanine loan and securitized the $225.0 million first mortgage, of which we retained $46.2 million. \n o $277.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the development of a 66-story condominium tower located in Long Island City, New York of which we funded $55.0 million. \n o $263.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the refinancing of a 44-property national hotel portfolio, of which we funded $230.8 million. \n o $239.3 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition of a nine-property office portfolio located in Manhattan's Upper West Side, which we fully funded. \n o $214.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition of a 1.2 million square foot Class A office tower located in Houston, Texas, of which we funded $118.0 million. \n \u00b7 Funded $539.0 million of previously originated loan commitments. \n \u00b7 Received gross proceeds of $3.6 billion (net proceeds of $2.1 billion) from maturities, sales and principal repayments on loans held-for-investment, single-borrower CMBS and preferred equity interests. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $516.1 million from single-asset securitizations of commercial loans, net of retained interests. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $15.1 million from a profit participation associated with a previously repaid loan, which was recognized as interest income. \n \u00b7 Received proceeds of $676.5 million, including retained RMBS of $91.0 million, from the securitization of $654.0 million residential mortgage loans. \n \u00b7 Sold commercial real estate within the Property Segment for total gross proceeds of $235.4 million and recognized net gains of $28.5 million. Additionally, sold commercial real estate within the Investing and Servicing Segment for total gross proceeds of $77.9 million and recognized net gains of $21.5 million. \n \u00b7 Originated or acquired commercial conduit loans of $1.4 billion. Separately, received proceeds of $1.6 billion from sales of previously originated commercial conduit loans. \n \u00b7 Obtained 35 new special servicing assignments for CMBS trusts with a total unpaid principal balance of $21.2 billion, one of which is in the process of being transitioned to us. \n \u00b7 Sold CMBS held by our Investing and Servicing Segment for total gross proceeds of $105.6 million and acquired CMBS for a purchase price of $155.7 million, net of non-controlling interests. \n \u00b7 Acquired commercial real estate from CMBS trusts for a gross purchase price of $53.1 million. \n \u00b7 Issued $500.0 million of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 February Notes\u201d). \n \u00b7 Repurchased 573,255 shares of common stock for a total cost of $12.1 million. \n \u00b7 Settled $263.4 million of redemption notices received on our 2019 Notes through the issuance of 12.4 million shares and cash payments of $25.5 million, recognizing a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million. \nSubsequent Events\nRefer to Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding significant transactions that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below is based on GAAP and therefore reflects the elimination of certain key financial statement line items related to the consolidation of securitization VIEs, particularly within revenues and other income, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our results of operations excluding the impact of ASC 810 as it relates to the consolidation of securitization VIEs, refer to the section captioned Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nThe following table compares our summarized results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $80.0 million to $627.9 million, compared to $547.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.3 million increase in interest income from investment securities. The increased interest income from loans was principally due to (i) increased LIBOR rates, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets, (ii) higher average balances of both commercial loans and residential loans held-for-sale and (iii) income received in 2018 from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by (iv) lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $99.5 million to $226.6 million, compared to $127.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $53.6 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio, (ii) a $40.3 million net increase in our loan loss allowance principally relating to impairment charges on certain commercial loans (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding these individual loan impairments) and (iii) a $6.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $26.5 million to $465.9 million, compared to $439.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase reflects the net increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average unlevered yields on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's loans and investment securities were as follows:\n\nThe increase in the overall weighted average unlevered yield is primarily due to increases in LIBOR and the loan profit participation income received in 2018, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets and lower levels of prepayment related income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 4.3% and 3.8%, respectively, and 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge\nfinancing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $4.5 million to $8.6 million, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $52.9 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $41.5 million unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The favorable change from derivatives reflects favorable changes of $52.2 million on foreign currency hedges and $0.7 million on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The favorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the unfavorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2018 versus a weakening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2017. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings, which fund fixed rate investments.\nInfrastructure Lending Segment\nThe Infrastructure Lending Segment was initially acquired on September 19, 2018 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Accordingly, the following discussion reflects its results for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2018 and includes no comparison to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues\nRevenues of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were $30.7 million, including interest income of $29.0 million from loans and $1.1 million from investment securities.\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts and expenses of our Infrastructure Lending Segment were $33.4 million, consisting of $20.9 million of interest expense on the debt facility used to finance a portion of the acquisition price and subsequent loan fundings, $6.8 million of acquisition costs, and $5.6 million of general and administrative expenses. Acquisition costs include a $3.0 million commitment fee related to an unused bridge financing facility and legal and due diligence costs of $3.8 million.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\n\nInterest income from infrastructure loans and investment securities and interest expense on the term loan reflect primarily variable LIBOR based rates. During the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2018, the weighted average unlevered yield on the Infrastructure Lending Segment's loans and investment securities held-for-investment was 5.9% while the weighted average unlevered yield on its loans held-for-sale was 3.6%. The weighted average secured borrowing rate on its debt facility, including amortization of deferred financing fees, was 4.7%.\nOther Income\nOther income of our Infrastructure Lending Segment was $0.4 million, consisting of a $1.8 million gain on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by $1.4 million in foreign currency losses on principally GBP and Euro-denominated loans.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the above-referenced Property Segment portfolios.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Property Segment increased $93.8 million to $292.9 million, compared to $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the fuller inclusion of rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio, which was acquired in September 2017, and the Woodstar II Portfolio, which was acquired over a period between December 2017 and September 2018.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $95.0 million to $292.5 million, compared to $197.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $37.1 million in depreciation and amortization, $27.4 million in other rental related costs and $28.6 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the fuller inclusion of the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio, both of which were acquired after August 2017.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Property Segment increased $112.6 million to $52.7 million, compared to a loss of $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $55.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, (ii) a $31.3 million favorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and (iii) $28.5 million of gains on sales of seven properties from the Master Lease Portfolio. The $55.1 million favorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives reflects a $47.1 million favorable change on foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and an $8.0 million favorable change on interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. The $31.3 million favorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities principally reflects the recognition in 2017 of $34.7 million of unfavorable changes in fair value of our equity investment in four regional shopping malls (the Retail Fund\u201d), which is an investment company that measures its assets at fair value.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $7.7 million to $304.5 million, compared to $312.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to decreases of $7.6 million in CMBS interest income and $7.3 million in servicing fees, partially offset by a $6.7 million increase in rental income on our REIS Equity Portfolio (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $4.0 million to $161.6 million, compared to $157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in interest expense and $5.4 million in costs of rental operations associated with our REIS Equity Portfolio, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflecting lower profit-based compensation, headcount and corporate expense allocations.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $81.4 million to $94.6 million, from $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other income was primarily due to (i) a $64.4 million decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities, (ii) a $21.1 million lesser increase in the fair value of CMBS investments and (iii) a $17.3 million lesser increase in the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale, partially offset by (iv) a $15.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights primarily reflecting the expected reduction in amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts and (v) a $6.1 million increase in gains on sales of operating properties. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities primarily reflects $53.9 million of non-recurring income during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company.\nCorporate and Other Items\nCorporate Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate expenses increased $10.2 million to $263.7 million, compared to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $6.7 million increase in management fees, (ii) a $1.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses and (iii) a $1.6 million increase in interest expense principally on our unsecured senior notes.\nCorporate Other Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate other loss increased $2.8 million to $9.4 million, compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to a $4.9 million increased loss on interest rate swaps used to hedge a portion of our unsecured senior notes, which are used to repay variable rate secured financing, partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nSecuritization VIE Eliminations\nSecuritization VIE eliminations primarily reclassify interest income and servicing fee revenues to other income for the CMBS and RMBS VIEs that we consolidate as primary beneficiary. Such eliminations have no overall effect on net income attributable to Starwood Property Trust. The reclassified revenues, along with applicable changes in fair value of investment securities and servicing rights, comprise the other income caption Change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs,\u201d which represents our beneficial interest in those consolidated VIEs. The magnitude of the\nsecuritization VIE eliminations is merely a function of the number of CMBS and RMBS trusts consolidated in any given period, and as such, is not a meaningful indicator of operating results. The eliminations primarily relate to CMBS trusts for which the Investing and Servicing Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary and, to a much lesser extent beginning in 2018, some CMBS and RMBS trusts for which the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment is deemed the primary beneficiary.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our income tax provision decreased $16.2 million to $15.3 million, compared to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily reflects (i) the effect of a lower statutory tax rate in 2018 and (ii) the absence of the additional tax expense in 2017 that resulted from a taxable gain on the disposition of an interest in an investee entity, partially offset by (iii) the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 and (iv) additional tax expense in 2018 as a result of taxable gains in our TRSs from sales of operating properties that had been held in our Master Lease Portfolio and REIS Equity Portfolio.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $13.4 million to $25.4 million, compared to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of non-controlling interests in our Woodstar II Portfolio, which consists of properties acquired in and after December 2017, partially offset by the effect of non-controlling interests in a non-recurring gain of a consolidated VIE during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $50.2 million to $547.9 million, compared to $497.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans principally due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $13.3 million to $127.1 million, compared to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $3.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by a $9.2 million decrease in our loan loss allowance.\nNet Interest Income (amounts in thousands)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment increased $30.6 million to $439.3 million, compared to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects the increase in interest income explained in the Revenues discussion above, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on our secured financing facilities.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the overall weighted average unlevered yield on the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's loans and investment securities was 7.5%. The weighted average unlevered yield remained unchanged primarily due to the benefits of increases in LIBOR, which offset lower levels of prepayment related income and the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's weighted average secured borrowing rates, inclusive of interest rate hedging costs and the amortization of deferred financing fees, were 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of bridge financing. The increases in borrowing rates primarily reflect increases in LIBOR.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment decreased $5.1 million to $4.1 million, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $76.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by a $71.2 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss). The unfavorable change from derivatives reflects a $77.6 million unfavorable change on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by a $0.8 million decreased loss on interest rate swaps. The foreign currency hedges are used to fix the U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows (both interest and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated loans and CMBS investments. The unfavorable change on the foreign currency hedges and the favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) reflect the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar against the GBP in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest rate swaps are used primarily to fix our interest rate payments on certain variable rate borrowings, which fund fixed rate investments.\nProperty Segment\nChange in Results by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Property Segment increased $84.5 million to $199.1 million, compared to $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the full year inclusion of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio, which was acquired in December 2016, and the Woodstar I Portfolio, which was acquired over a period from October 2015 through April 2016. Also contributing to the increase was rental income from the Master Lease Portfolio which was acquired on September 25, 2017. The first phase of our Woodstar II Portfolio was acquired on December 28, 2017, so such acquisition had little impact on revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Property Segment increased $65.6 million to $197.5 million, compared to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs and expenses reflects increases of $22.9 million in depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in other rental related costs and $24.5 million in interest expense, all primarily due to the full year inclusion of the Medical Office Portfolio and Woodstar I Portfolio and acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by lower amortization related to the Woodstar I Portfolio's in-place lease intangible asset, which is fully amortized, and a $7.5 million decrease in acquisition costs not capitalized.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income (loss) of our Property Segment decreased $112.2 million to a loss of $59.9 million, compared to income of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other income (loss) was primarily due to (i) a $65.8 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives of which $38.7 million related to foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge our Euro currency exposure with respect to the Ireland Portfolio and $27.1 million related to interest rate swaps which primarily hedge the variable interest rate risk on borrowings secured by our Medical Office Portfolio, (ii) a $37.4 million unfavorable change in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities due to decreases in fair value of the properties in the Retail Fund (see Notes 8 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii) the non-recurrence of an $8.4 million bargain purchase gain recognized on the Woodstar I Portfolio in the second quarter of 2016.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $40.6 million to $312.2 million, compared to $352.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases of $33.8 million in servicing fees and $11.9 million in interest income from CMBS investments, partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio. The $33.8 million decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business in October 2016 and lower domestic servicing fees. The $11.9 million decrease in CMBS interest income reflects a lower level of CMBS interest recoveries from asset liquidations by CMBS trusts.\nCosts and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, costs and expenses of our Investing and Servicing Segment decreased $16.2 million to $157.6 million, compared to $173.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to a $26.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses principally reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower compensation costs, partially offset by increases of $4.4 million in costs of rental operations, $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.9 million in interest expense, all primarily related to our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income of our Investing and Servicing Segment increased $171.6 million to $176.0 million, compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to (i) a $98.4 million favorable change in fair value of CMBS investments to an increase of $54.3 million compared to a decrease of $44.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (ii) a $53.9 million increase in earnings from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a $19.8 million gain on sale of five operating properties, (iv) a $12.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights reflecting the expected reduction in amortization of this deteriorating asset net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts, all partially offset by (v) a $9.6 million lesser increase\nin the fair value of our conduit loans held-for-sale.\nCorporate and Other Items\nCorporate Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate expenses increased $22.3 million to $253.5 million, compared to $231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense principally on our 2021 Senior Notes issued in December 2016 and our 2025 Senior Notes issued in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our reduced term loan borrowings and our 2017 Convertible Notes which matured in October 2017, and (ii) a $5.0 million increase in management fees.\nCorporate Other Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate other loss increased $2.1 million to $6.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate other loss was primarily due to (i) a $2.5 million decrease in other income, which included a reimbursement received related to a partnership guarantee arrangement in 2016, and (ii) a $2.4 million loss on an interest rate swap used to hedge the portion of our 2025 Senior Notes used to repay variable-rate secured financing, partially offset by (iii) a $2.8 million decreased loss on extinguishment of debt.\nSecuritization VIE Eliminations\nRefer to the preceding comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of the nature of securitization VIE eliminations.\nIncome Tax Provision\nHistorically, our consolidated income tax provision principally relates to the taxable nature of the Investing and Servicing Segment's loan servicing and loan conduit businesses which are housed in TRSs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our income tax provision increased $23.2 million to $31.5 million, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflects (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs associated with earnings from our interest in an investor entity, which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the year ended December 31, 2017, and (ii) an income tax provision of $10.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $9.5 million to $12.0 million, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to non-controlling interests in a non-recurring gain of a consolidated VIE.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following:\n (i) non-cash equity compensation expense; \n (ii) incentive fees due under our management agreement; \n\n (iv) acquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions; \n (v) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income; and \n (vi) any deductions for distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein. \nWe believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash adjustments and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to (and expected by) its investors.\nHowever, the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs.\nThe weighted average diluted share count applied to Core Earnings for purposes of determining Core Earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) is computed using the GAAP diluted share count, adjusted for the following:\n (i) Unvested stock awards - Currently, unvested stock awards are excluded from the denominator of GAAP EPS. The related compensation expense is also excluded from Core Earnings. In order to effectuate dilution from these awards in the Core Earnings computation, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to include these shares. \n (ii) Convertible Notes - Conversion of our Convertible Notes is an event that is contingent upon numerous factors, none of which are in our control, and is an event that may or may not occur. Consistent with the treatment of other unrealized adjustments to Core Earnings, we adjust the GAAP diluted share count to exclude the potential shares issuable upon conversion until a conversion occurs. \n (iii) Subsidiary equity - The intent of the February 2018 amendment to our management agreement (the Amendment\u201d) is to treat subsidiary equity in the same manner as if parent equity had been issued. The Class A Units issued in connection with the acquisition of assets in our Woodstar II Portfolio are currently excluded from our GAAP diluted share count, with the subsidiary equity represented as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our GAAP balance sheet. Consistent with the Amendment, we adjust GAAP diluted share count to include these subsidiary units. \nThe following table presents our diluted weighted average shares used in our GAAP EPS calculation reconciled to our diluted weighted average shares used in our Core EPS calculation (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe definition of Core Earnings allows management to make adjustments, subject to the approval of a majority of our independent directors, in situations where such adjustments are considered appropriate in order for Core Earnings to be calculated in a manner consistent with its definition and objective. No adjustments to the definition of Core Earnings became effective during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs a reminder, in 2015, we adjusted the calculation of Core Earnings related to the equity component of our convertible notes. We previously amortized the equity component of these instruments through interest expense for Core Earnings purposes, consistent with our GAAP treatment. However, for Core Earnings purposes, the amount is not considered realized until the earlier of (a) the entire issuance of the notes has been extinguished; or (b) the equity portion has been fully amortized via repurchases of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we extinguished a portion of our 2019 Notes, consisting of an unpaid principal balance of $263.4 million. The notes were extinguished with 12.4 million common shares and $25.5 million of cash, reflecting a premium to par of $33.4 million. The proportionate share of the premium which was settled in cash was first used to fully amortize the remaining equity portion of the notes, with the remaining amount recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt for Core Earnings purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss totaled $2.9 million. The corresponding GAAP loss was $2.1 million (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nIn March 2018, our 2018 Notes matured and were fully repaid in cash. The equity portion of the 2018 Notes had not been fully amortized. As a result, we reflected $10.0 million as a positive adjustment to Core Earnings, representing the $28.1 million equity balance recognized upon issuance of the 2018 Notes, net of $18.1 million in adjustments related to cumulative repurchases through the maturity date.\nThe following table summarizes our quarterly Core Earnings per weighted average diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations and reconciliation to Core Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations and reconciliation to Core Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations and reconciliation to Core Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, by business segment (amounts in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nThe Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $25.2 million, from $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $445.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $627.2 million, costs and expenses were $187.5 million and other income was $9.8 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.5 million increase in interest income from investment securities. The increased interest income from loans was principally due to (i) increased LIBOR rates, partially offset by the compression of interest rate spreads in credit markets, (ii) higher average balances of both commercial loans and residential loans held-for-sale and (iii) income received in 2018 from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016, partially offset by (iv) lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $59.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $53.6 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and a $6.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nCore other income increased by $6.9 million, primarily due to a $24.3 million favorable change in foreign currency gain (loss) and a $4.1 million increase in realized gains on sales of investments primarily from securitizations of residential loans held-for-sale, partially offset by a $23.1 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on foreign currency derivatives.\nInfrastructure Lending Segment\nThe Infrastructure Lending Segment had Core Earnings of $1.3 million for the period from the initial acquisition on September 19, 2018 through December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $30.7 million, costs and expenses were $29.1 million and other income (loss) was nominal.\nRevenues of $30.7 million included interest income of $29.0 million from loans and $1.1 million from investment securities.\nCosts and expenses of $29.1 million consisted of $20.9 million of interest expense on the debt facility used to finance a portion of the acquisition price and subsequent loan fundings, $5.2 million of general and administrative expenses and a $3.0 million acquisition-related commitment fee related to an unused bridge financing facility.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n\nThe Property Segment's Core Earnings increased by $46.7 million, from $75.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $122.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $291.6 million, costs and expenses were $183.1 million and other income was $21.6 million.\nCore revenues increased by $94.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the fuller inclusion of rental income for the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio, both of which were acquired after August 2017.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $58.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $29.3 million and rental related costs of $27.4 million primarily relating to the fuller inclusion of the Master Lease Portfolio and Woodstar II Portfolio.\nCore other income increased by $18.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $23.1 million net gain on sale of seven properties in the Master Lease Portfolio, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in equity in earnings recognized from our investment in the Retail Fund.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nThe Investing and Servicing Segment's Core Earnings decreased by $36.3 million, from $271.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $235.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $321.7 million, costs and expenses were $136.5 million, other income was $60.0 million, income tax provision was $4.7 million and the deduction of income attributable to non-controlling interests was $5.2 million.\nCore revenues decreased by $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases of $7.3 million in servicing fees and $4.6 million in interest income from our CMBS portfolio, partially offset by an increase of $7.0 million in rental income from our REIS Equity Portfolio. The treatment of CMBS interest income on a GAAP basis is complicated by our application of the ASC 810 consolidation rules. In an attempt to treat these securities similar to the trust's other investment securities, we compute core interest income pursuant to an effective yield methodology. In doing so, we segregate the portfolio into various categories based on the components of the bonds' cash flows and the volatility related to each of these components. We then accrete interest income on an effective yield basis using the components of cash flows that are reliably estimable. Other minor adjustments are made to reflect management's expectations for other components of the projected cash flow stream.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases of $7.6 million in interest expense and $5.3 million in costs of rental operations associated with our REIS Equity Portfolio, partially offset by an $11.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflecting lower profit-based compensation, headcount and corporate expense allocations.\nCore other income includes profit realized upon securitization of loans by our conduit business, gains on sales of CMBS and operating properties, gains and losses on derivatives that were either effectively terminated or novated, and earnings from unconsolidated entities. These items are typically offset by a decrease in the fair value of our domestic servicing rights intangible which reflects the expected amortization of this deteriorating asset, net of increases in fair value due to the attainment of new servicing contracts. Derivatives include instruments which hedge interest rate risk and credit risk on our conduit loans. For GAAP purposes, the loans, CMBS and derivatives are accounted for at fair value, with all changes in fair value (realized or unrealized) recognized in earnings. The adjustments to Core Earnings outlined above are also applied to the GAAP earnings of our unconsolidated entities. Core other income decreased by $54.4 million principally due to decreases of $52.8 million in earnings from unconsolidated entities and $18.8 million in realized gains on conduit loans, partially offset by a $15.9 million lesser decrease in fair value of servicing rights. The decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities reflects a $52.4 million realized gain in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during that year.\nIncome taxes, which principally relate to the operating results of our servicing and conduit businesses which are held in TRSs, decreased $25.9 million due to (i) a decrease in the taxable income of our TRSs, which during the year ended December 31, 2017 included the realized gain related to the unconsolidated investor entity which sold nearly all of its interest in an online real estate company, (ii) the non-recurring impact in 2017 of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a (iii) a lower statutory tax rate in 2018.\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests increased $1.8 million primarily due to the increased minority investors' share of gains from operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCorporate\nCore corporate costs and expenses increased by $13.0 million, from $183.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $196.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $9.1 million decrease in core gains on extinguishment of debt and a $5.4 million increase in base management fees.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCommercial and Residential Lending Segment\nThe Commercial and Residential Lending Segment's Core Earnings increased by $26.5 million, from $393.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $420.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $547.0 million, costs and expenses were $128.3 million and other income was $2.9 million.\nCore revenues, consisting principally of interest income on loans, increased by $50.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher average loan balances and LIBOR rates, partially offset by lower levels of prepayment related income.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) a $19.2 million increase in interest expense associated with the various secured financing facilities used to fund a portion of our investment portfolio and (ii) a $1.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses.\nCore other income decreased by $0.9 million.\nProperty Segment\nCore Earnings by Portfolio (amounts in thousands)\n\nThe Property Segment's Core Earnings increased by $29.4 million, from $46.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $75.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $197.6 million, costs and expenses were $124.3 million and other income was $2.8 million.\nCore revenues increased by $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of rental income for the Medical Office Portfolio and the Woodstar I Portfolio and the acquisition of the Master Lease Portfolio.\nCore costs and expenses increased by $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $25.1 million, primarily on the secured financing for the Medical Office and Master Lease Portfolios, and rental related costs of $24.5 million.\nCore other income decreased by $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in equity in earnings recognized from our investment in the Retail Fund.\nInvesting and Servicing Segment\nThe Investing and Servicing Segment's Core Earnings increased by $29.2 million, from $242.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $271.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. After making adjustments for the calculation of Core Earnings, revenues were $326.1 million, costs and expenses were $134.9 million, other income was $114.4 million, income tax provision was $30.6 million and the deduction of income attributable to non-controlling interests was $3.4 million.\nCore revenues decreased by $46.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to decreases of $33.8 million in servicing fees reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower domestic servicing fees, $17.6 million in interest income from our CMBS portfolio and $3.7 million in interest income from conduit loans, partially offset by a $12.5 million increase in rental income on our expanded REIS Equity Portfolio.\nCore costs and expenses decreased by $17.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses reflecting the divestiture of our European servicing and advisory business and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by increases in costs of rental operations and interest expense on secured financings for CMBS and the REIS Equity Portfolio.\nCore other income increased by $81.4 million principally due to (i) a $52.4 million realized gain from an unconsolidated investor entity which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the third quarter of 2017, (ii) a $23.2 million increase in realized gains on sales of operating properties and CMBS and (iii) a $21.4 million decrease in amortization of servicing rights, all partially offset by (iv) a $9.4 million decrease in realized gains on conduit loans and (v) core write-downs of $5.5 million on CMBS.\nIncome taxes, which principally relate to the operating results of our servicing and conduit businesses which are held in TRSs, increased $20.6 million due to (i) an increase in the taxable income of our TRSs primarily associated with realized gains from our interest in an investor entity, which owns equity in an online real estate company and sold nearly all of its interest during the third quarter of 2017 and (ii) the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests increased $2.5 million primarily due to minority investors' share of gains from two operating properties sold during the third quarter of 2017.\nCorporate\nCore corporate costs and expenses increased by $3.4 million, from $179.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $183.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in interest expense of $18.7 million and base management fees of $6.8 million, partially offset by a favorable change in core gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt of $24.0 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make new investments where appropriate, pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity and access to additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity are as follows:\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in thousands)\n\nThe discussion below is on a non-GAAP basis, after removing adjustments principally resulting from the consolidation of the securitization VIEs under ASC 810. These adjustments principally relate to (i) purchases of CMBS, RMBS, loans and real estate from consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as repayments of VIE debt on a GAAP basis and (ii) principal collections of CMBS and RMBS related to consolidated VIEs, which are reflected as VIE distributions on a GAAP basis. There is no significant net impact to cash flows from operations or to overall cash resulting from these consolidations. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $72.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of $588.1 million and net cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities of $2.7 billion.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $588.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to cash interest income of $515.3 million from our loan origination and conduit programs and cash interest income on investment securities of $162.3 million. Net rental income provided cash of $223.6 million and servicing fees provided cash of $110.8 million. Proceeds from principal collections and sales of loans held-for-sale, net of originations and purchases, provided cash of $141.8 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $13.8 million. Offsetting these cash inflows was cash interest expense of $337.6 million, general and administrative expenses of $143.9 million, management fees of $92.3 million and business combination costs of $8.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to the acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment for $2.2 billion, the origination and acquisition of new loans held-for-investment of $4.4 billion, the purchase of investment securities of $877.9 million and the purchase of properties and other assets of $82.5 million, partially offset by the proceeds received from principal collections and sales of loans of $3.9 billion, investment securities of $596.9 million and sale/recovery of properties of $311.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 related primarily to borrowings on our secured debt, net of repayments and deferred loan costs, of $2.9 billion, including $1.7 billion to finance the acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment, and net borrowings after repayments of our unsecured debt of $97.5 million, partially offset by dividend distributions of $510.0 million and net distributions to non-controlling interests of $242.5 million. The net distributions to non-controlling interests were principally related to the 2018 closing of the Woodstar II Portfolio acquisition.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe utilize a variety of financing arrangements, including:\n 1) Repurchase Agreements: Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own. Under these agreements, we sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty. As of December 31, 2018, we had various repurchase agreements, with details referenced in the table provided below. \n 2) Secured Property Financings: We use long-term mortgage facilities from commercial lenders and government sponsors of affordable housing loans to finance many of the investment properties that we hold. These facilities accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We typically hedge our exposure to floating interest rate changes on these facilities through the use of interest rate swap and cap derivatives. \n 3) Bank Credit Facilities: We use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities) to finance our assets. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. The lender retains the sole discretion, subject to certain conditions, over the market value of such note for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the lender. \n 4) Loan Sales, Syndications and Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from loan sales, syndications and/or securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans. The sales, syndications or securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Sales, syndications or securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question. \n 5) Unsecured Senior Notes: We issue senior notes, some of which are convertible, to finance certain operating and investing activities of the Company. These senior notes accrue interest at fixed interest rates and vary in tenure. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n 6) Federal Home Loan Bank Financing: As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, we have the ability to borrow funds from the FHLB of Chicago at both fixed and variable rates to finance eligible collateral, which includes residential mortgage loans. \nThe following table is a summary of our secured financing facilities as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (a) Subject to certain conditions as defined in the respective facility agreement. \n (b) Approved but undrawn capacity represents the total draw amount that has been approved by the lender related to those assets that have been pledged as collateral, less the drawn amount. \n (c) Unallocated financing amount represents the maximum facility size less the total draw capacity that has been approved by the lender. \n (d) Maturity date for borrowings collateralized by loans is September 2019 with an additional extension option to September 2021. Borrowings collateralized by loans existing at maturity may remain outstanding until such loan collateral matures, subject to certain specified conditions and not to exceed September 2025. \n (e) The initial maximum facility size of $600.0 million may be increased to $900 million at our option, subject to certain conditions. \n (f) Maturity date for borrowings collateralized by loans is May 2020 with an additional extension option to August 2021. Borrowings collateralized by loans existing at maturity may remain outstanding until such loan collateral matures, subject to certain specified conditions. \n (g) Subject to borrower's option to choose alternative benchmark based rates pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. \n (h) The initial maximum facility size of $300.0 million may be increased to $650.0 million, subject to certain conditions. \n (i) Facility carries a rolling 11-month term which may reset monthly with the lender's consent. This facility carries no maximum facility size. \n (j) Facility carries a rolling 12-month term which may reset monthly with the lender's consent. Current maturity is December 2019. This facility carries no maximum facility size. Amounts reflect the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2018. \n (k) The date that is 270 days after the buyer delivers notice to seller, subject to a maximum date of May 2020. \nRefer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of new secured credit facilities and amendments to existing credit facilities entered into during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nVariance between Average and Quarter-End Credit Facility Borrowings Outstanding\nThe following tables compare the average amount outstanding under our secured financing agreements during each quarter and the amount outstanding as of the end of each quarter, together with an explanation of significant variances (amounts in thousands):\n\n (a) The Commercial and Residential Lending Segment funded 63% of the second quarter's total loan fundings during June 2018, which resulted in the Company drawing on its secured financing agreements near quarter end to finance the additional loan fundings. \n (b) The Infrastructure Lending Segment acquisition closed on September 19, 2018, which resulted in the funding of $1.5 billion under the new Infrastructure Lending Facility. \n (c) Variance primarily due to the following: (i) $83.0 million repaid on the Lender 4 Repo 2 facility in December 2018; and (ii) $37.0 million repaid on the Lender 2 Repo 1 facility in December 2018. \n\n (a) Variance primarily due to the following: (i) $336.8 million drawn on the Lender 1 Repo 1 facility in March 2017. \n (b) Variance primarily due to the following: (i) $136.8 million drawn on the Lender 10 Repo 1 facility in May 2017; and (ii) $60.0 million drawn on the Lender 4 Repo 2 facility throughout the quarter. \n (c) Variance primarily due to the following: (i) $265.9 million drawn on the Master Lease Mortgages in September 2017; (ii) $265.3 million drawn on the Lender 6 Repo 1 facility throughout the quarter; and (iii) $250.0 million drawn on FHLB in July 2017. \n (d) Variance primarily due to the following: (i) $188.7 million repaid on former Lender 9 Repo 1 throughout the quarter; and (ii) $59.0 million repaid on Lender 10 Repo 1 in December 2017; partially offset by (iii) $195.0 million drawn on FHLB throughout the quarter. \nBorrowings under Unsecured Senior Notes\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average effective borrowing rate on our unsecured senior notes was 4.8% and 5.5%, respectively. The effective borrowing rate includes the effects of underwriter purchase discount and the adjustment for the conversion option on the convertible notes, the initial value of which reduced the balance of the notes.\nRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure regarding the terms of our unsecured senior notes.\nScheduled Principal Repayments on Investments and Overhang on Financing Facilities\nThe following scheduled and/or projected principal repayments on our investments were based upon the amounts outstanding and contractual terms of the financing facilities in effect as of December 31, 2018 (amounts in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes $418.2 million of repayments associated with a secured financing facility that carries a rolling 12-month term which may reset monthly with the lender's consent. \nIn the normal course of business, the Company is in discussions with its lenders to extend or amend any financing facilities which contain near term expirations.\nIssuances of Equity Securities\nWe may raise funds through capital market transactions by issuing capital stock. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have authorized 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2018, we had 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and 224,340,448 shares of common stock available for issuance.\nRefer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our issuances of equity securities in recent years.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nIn the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including other secured as well as unsecured forms of borrowing and sale of certain investment securities which no longer meet our return requirements.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities and Convertible Senior Notes\nIn September 2014, our board of directors authorized and announced the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of one year. Subsequent amendments to the repurchase program approved by our board of directors in December 2014, June 2015, January 2016 and February 2017 resulted in the program being (i) amended to increase maximum repurchases to $500.0 million, (ii) expanded to allow for the repurchase of our outstanding convertible senior notes under the program and (iii) extended through January 2019. Purchases made pursuant to the program are made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are discretionary and are subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $12.1 million of common stock and no convertible senior notes under the repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, we had $250.1 million of remaining capacity to repurchase common stock and/or convertible senior notes under the repurchase program.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have relationships with unconsolidated entities and financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as VIEs. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our involvement in VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity and any unfunded capital commitments. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDividends\nWe intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed dividend history.\nThe tax treatment for our aggregate distributions per share of common stock paid with respect to the 2018 tax year is as follows:\n\nTo the extent that total dividends for the 2018 tax year exceeded 2018 taxable income, the portion of the fourth quarter dividend paid in January of 2019 that is equal to such excess is treated as a 2019 dividend for federal tax purposes.\nLeverage Policies\nWe employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our stockholders, or provide temporary liquidity. Leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing or indirect through originating, acquiring or retaining subordinated mortgages, B-Notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed, we intend, when possible, to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the Company of credit losses associated with any individual asset. In addition, we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements.\nThe amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. and European economy and commercial, residential and infrastructure markets, our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed 75% of total assets (as defined), as adjusted to remove the impact of bona-fide loan sales that are accounted for as financings and the consolidation of VIEs pursuant to GAAP. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt to assets ratio was 66.9%.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\n (a) Represents the contractual maturity of the respective credit facility, inclusive of available extension options. If investments that have been pledged as collateral repay earlier than the contractual maturity of the debt, the related portion of the debt would likewise require earlier repayment. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the expected maturities by year. \n (b) These amounts relate to financial asset sales that were required to be accounted for as secured borrowings. As a result, the assets we sold remain on our consolidated balance sheet for financial reporting purposes. Such assets are expected to provide match funding for these liabilities. \n (c) Excludes $193.0 million of loan funding commitments in which management projects the Company will not be obligated to fund in the future due to repayments made by the borrower earlier than, or in excess of, expectations. \n (d) Represents contractual commitments of $240.5 million under revolvers and letters of credit ( LCs\u201d) and $169.2 million under delayed draw term commitment. \n (e) Represents the Company's contractual commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans from a third party residential mortgage originator. \nThe table above does not include interest payable, amounts due under our management agreement, amounts due under our derivative agreements or amounts due under guarantees as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. The following discussion describes the critical accounting estimates that apply to our operations and require complex management judgment. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoan Impairment\nWe evaluate each loan classified as held-for-investment for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we record an allowance through the provision for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nWe regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, the collateral's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the collateral's liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the collateral. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate or industry sector and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants.\nSignificant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. The loan loss allowance was $39.2 million as of December 31, 2018, which includes $38.2 million of impairment reserves on specific loans recorded during 2018 and a general loan loss allowance of $1.0 million based on our loan risk rating system.\nClassification and Impairment Evaluation of Investment Securities\nOur investment securities consist primarily of (i) RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, (ii) CMBS, infrastructure bonds and mandatorily redeemable preferred equity interests in commercial real estate entities which we expect to hold to maturity and (iii) CMBS and RMBS for which we have elected the fair value option. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at their fair value. For available-for-sale debt securities where we have not elected the fair value option, changes in fair value are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, rather than through earnings. We do not hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes.\nWhen the estimated fair value of a debt security for which we have not elected to apply the fair value option is less than its amortized cost, we consider whether there is other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) in the value of the security. An impairment is deemed an OTTI if (i) we intend to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis or (iii) we do not expect to recover our cost basis even if we do not\nintend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis. If the impairment is deemed to be an OTTI, the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the OTTI. If the OTTI has resulted from (i) our intention to sell the security, or (ii) our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value. Whereas, if the OTTI has resulted from our conclusion that we will not recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, only the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in earnings, and the portion of the loss related to other factors, such as changes in interest rates, continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Determining whether there is an OTTI may require us to exercise significant judgment and make significant assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimated cash flows, estimated prepayments, loss assumptions, and assumptions regarding changes in interest rates. As a result, actual OTTI losses could differ from reported amounts. Such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors, including (i) credit of the issuer or the borrowers, (ii) credit rating of the security, (iii) key terms of the security, (iv) performance of underlying loans, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, (v) the value of the collateral for underlying loans, (vi) the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors, and (vii) the historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for similar securities. As of December 31, 2018, we held $209.1 million of available-for-sale RMBS which had gross unrealized gains of $53.5 million and immaterial unrealized losses. We also had $644.1 million of held-to-maturity debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of $3.5 million and gross unrealized gains of $3.3 million as of December 31, 2018. We recognized no material OTTI charges against earnings with respect to our investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nValuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nWe measure our VIE assets and liabilities, mortgage-backed securities, derivative assets and liabilities, domestic servicing rights intangible asset and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value option at fair value. When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the various methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $54.5 billion and $52.2 billion of financial assets and liabilities, respectively, that are measured at fair value, including $53.4 billion of VIE assets and $52.2 billion of VIE liabilities we consolidate pursuant to ASC 810.\nWe measure the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs at fair value pursuant to our election of the fair value option. The VIEs in which we invest are static\u201d; that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the VIE, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. As a result, the methods and inputs we use in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of our VIEs affect our earnings only to the extent of their impact on our direct investment in the VIEs.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill at December 31, 2018 of $259.8 million represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of LNR in April 2013 and the Infrastructure Lending Segment in September 2018 and October 2018. In testing goodwill for impairment, we follow ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which permits a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is determined to exist for the reporting unit. However, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, we compare the fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill ( Step One\u201d). If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired with the impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nBased on our qualitative assessments during the fourth quarter of 2018, we believe that the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which the LNR acquisition goodwill was attributed is not currently at risk of failing Step One of the impairment test. This qualitative assessment required judgment to be applied in evaluating the effects of multiple factors, including actual and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and relevant entity specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The first annual goodwill impairment test for the recently-acquired Infrastructure Lending Segment will occur in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is expected to require the application of similar judgment.\nProperty Impairment\nWe review properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the property to the undiscounted future net cash flows it is expected to generate. If such carrying amount exceeds the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we adjust the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value. The estimation of future net cash flows and fair values of our properties involves significant judgments by our management, and changes to these judgments could significantly impact our reported results of operation. As of December 31, 2018 we held properties with a carrying value of $2.8 billion, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or each reporting period for certain cost method investments. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. As of December 31, 2018, we held investments in unconsolidated entities with a carrying value of $171.8 million, none of which we determined were impaired at any point during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and the expected impact to the Company.",
