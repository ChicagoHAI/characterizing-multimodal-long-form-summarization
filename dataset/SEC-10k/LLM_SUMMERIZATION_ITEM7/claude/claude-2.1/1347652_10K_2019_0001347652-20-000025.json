MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain statements included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In many cases, these forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \"will,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"goals,\" \"objectives,\" \"targets,\" \"predicts,\" \"plans,\" \"seeks,\" or similar expressions. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this Report.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and we can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information.\nBUSINESS OBJECTIVE\nCorEnergy primarily owns and seeks to own assets in the U.S. energy sector that perform utility-like functions, such as pipelines, storage terminals, rail terminals and gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. We also may provide other types of capital, including loans secured by energy infrastructure assets. Our objective has been to generate long-term contracted revenue from operators of our assets, primarily under triple-net participating leases without direct commodity price exposure. As a result of having received the PLR, we are now able to consider, and are considering, a broader set of investment opportunities than was available to us prior to issuance of the PLR. For additional information, see \"Company Overview\" in Item 1 of this Report.\nThe assets are primarily mission-critical, in that utilization of the assets is necessary for the business the operators of those assets seek to conduct and their rental payments are an essential operating expense. We acquire assets that will enhance the stability of our dividend through diversification, while offering the potential for long-term distribution growth. These sale-leaseback or real property mortgage transactions provide the energy company with a source of capital that is an alternative to sources such as corporate borrowing,\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nbond offerings, or equity offerings. We believe our leadership team's energy and utility expertise provides CorEnergy with a competitive advantage to acquire, own and lease U.S. energy infrastructure assets in a tax-efficient, transparent and investor-friendly REIT.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc., as of December 31, 2019, and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the financial data and key operating statistics for CorEnergy for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We believe the Operating Results detail presented below provides investors with information that will assist them in analyzing our operating performance.

2018\nRevenue. Consolidated revenues were $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $3.3 million. Lease revenue was $67.1 million and $72.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the decrease of approximately $5.7 million driven primarily by (i) the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility, partially offset by (ii) an increase in variable rent collected on the Pinedale lease during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransportation and distribution revenue from our subsidiaries MoGas and Omega was $18.8 million and $16.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $2.3 million increase primarily resulted from higher rates going into effect on December 1, 2018 related to the rate case filed by MoGas with the FERC, net of the final refund liability. The FERC rate case settlement was approved in August of 2019. Refer to \"Asset Portfolio and Related Developments\" for further discussion related to the FERC rate case settlement.\nTransportation and Distribution Expenses. Transportation and distribution expenses were $5.2 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $2.0 million. The decrease relates primarily to lower legal, consulting and maintenance costs at MoGas.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The most significant components of the variance from the prior year are outlined in the following table and explained below:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,786,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,591,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and professional fees\n</td> <td>2,413,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,396,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,691,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,596,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,042,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement fees are directly proportional to our asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2019, management fees decreased $805 thousand compared to the prior year due to (i) cash utilized for the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchange in the first quarter of 2019, (ii) management fee waivers in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 to exclude the net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Notes offering (other than the cash portion of such proceeds utilized in connection with the exchange of the Company's 7.00% Convertible Notes) and (iii) lower incentive fees due to decreased revenue from the sale of the Portland Terminal in December 2018. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") for additional information.\nAcquisition and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.3 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in professional fees. Professional fees decreased $1.0 million during the current year while asset acquisition expenses decreased $336 thousand. Generally, we expect asset acquisition expenses to be repaid over time from income generated by acquisitions. However, any particular period may reflect significant expenses arising from third party legal, engineering, and consulting fees that are incurred in the early to mid-stages of due diligence. The decrease in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to higher legal and consulting costs in the prior year related to monitoring our GIGS asset and the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility, partially offset by legal and consulting costs incurred in the current year related to the ongoing litigation with EGC/Cox Oil. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") for additional information.\nOther expenses for the for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $295 thousand compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to a loss on settlement of ARO related to the decommissioning of a segment of the GIGS pipeline system during the prior year.\nDepreciation, Amortization and ARO Accretion Expense. Depreciation, amortization and ARO accretion expense was $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $2.4 million decrease was primarily driven by depreciation expense, which decreased approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense was driven by (i) the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility in December of 2018 and (ii) updates made to the estimated useful lives of certain ARO segments of GIGS at the end of 2018.\nProvision for loan gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for loan gain of approximately $37 thousand related to the satisfaction of the SWD loans with Four Wood Corridor upon sale of the assets securing the loans to Compass SWD, LLC in exchange for (i) a new loan agreement with Compass SWD, LLC for $1.3 million and (ii) cash proceeds from the sale recognized as principal payments on the SWD loans. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 5 (\"Financing Notes Receivable\"). There were no loan (gain) loss provisions recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Distributions and Other Income. Net distributions and other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.3 million compared to $107 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to interest income, which increased approximately $1.2 million from the prior-year period, due to a higher cash balance maintained during 2019. Net distributions of approximately $0.1 million recognized for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were impacted by (i) the sale of a large portion of the Lightfoot investment as a result of the Arc Logistics merger with Zenith, completed on December 21, 2017, (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018 and (iii) and the liquidation of Lightfoot at the end of 2019.\nThe portion of distributions and dividends deemed to be income versus a return of capital in any period are estimated at the time such distributions are received. These estimates may be subsequently revised based on information received from the portfolio company after their tax reporting periods are concluded. The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross cash distributions and dividend income received from our investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 to the net distributions and other income recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross cash distributions and other income received from investment securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,328,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (dividend income) which have been reclassified as income (return of capital) in a subsequent period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions and dividends received in current period deemed a return of capital and not recorded as income (recorded as a cost reduction) in the current period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>663,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net distributions and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,328,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Realized and Unrealized Loss on Other Equity Securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss on other equity securities of $1.8 million. The net loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to valuation considerations surrounding the arbitration award delivered to Eni USA and Gulf LNG as well as other market information. Due to the sale or asset disposition related to our investment securities at the end of 2018 and the liquidation of the remaining investment interest at the end of 2019, we no longer have an interest in other equity securities.\nInterest Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expense totaled approximately $10.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in interest expense as a result of the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchanges and conversions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by (ii) additional interest expense from the 5.875% Convertible Notes Offering in August of 2019. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\").\nGain on the sale of leased property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the sale of leased property totaling approximately $11.7 million was recorded in connection with the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility to Zenith Terminals on December 21, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\"). There was no gain on the sale of leased property recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $34.0 million was recorded in connection with the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchanges completed in the first and third quarters of 2019. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\"). There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense was $235 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The income tax expense recorded in the current year is primarily the result of (i) a change in our state effective rate due to changes in state law and state operations by certain of our TRS entities, (ii) certain fixed asset, deferred contract revenue and loan loss activities, partially offset by (iii) the impact of the refund liability related to the FERC rate case settlement and (iv) capital losses generated from the Lightfoot liquidation that will be carried back against capital gains from prior years. The income tax benefit recorded in the prior year was primarily attributable to (i) higher losses generated by our TRS subsidiaries and (ii) the capital losses generated from the sale of our interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest that were carried back against capital gains generated from the sale of a portion of the Lightfoot investment in prior years.\nNet Income. Net income was $4.1 million and $43.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $39.6 million. After deducting $9.3 million and $9.5 million for the portion of preferred dividends that are allocable to each respective period, net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $(5.2) million, or $(0.40) per basic and diluted common share, as compared to $34.2 million, or $2.86 per basic and $2.79 diluted common share, for the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. Consolidated revenues were $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $482 thousand. Lease revenue was $72.7 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with the increase of approximately $3.9 million driven primarily by variable rent collected on the Pinedale lease during 2018. Transportation and distribution revenue from our subsidiaries MoGas and Omega was $16.5 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $3.5 million decrease primarily resulted from a change to straight-line revenue recognition on MoGas' long-term contract with Spire under the new revenue recognition standard that was adopted on January 1, 2018. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.2 million lower under the new accounting standard. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 4 (\"Transportation And Distribution Revenue\") for additional details.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransportation and Distribution Expenses. Transportation and distribution expenses were $7.2 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $481 thousand. The increase relates primarily to MoGas, which had higher legal and consulting costs during 2018 related to the FERC rate case. The increase was partially offset by lower costs from the timing of projects performed by Omega for Fort Leonard Wood.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The most significant components of the variance from the prior year are outlined in the following table and explained below: Table 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,591,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,213,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and professional fees\n</td> <td>3,759,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,380,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,691,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,191,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,042,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,786,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement fees are directly proportional to our asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2018, management fees increased $378 thousand compared to the prior year due to the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Pinedale LP, which closed on December 29, 2017. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") for additional information.\nAcquisition and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.4 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in professional fees. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to (i) higher legal and consulting costs in the current-year related to monitoring our GIGS asset, (ii) higher legal and consulting fees related to the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility and (iii) a prior-year reimbursement of legal fees received in 2017 for costs incurred during UPL's bankruptcy.\nAsset acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were relatively consistent with the prior year, decreasing $71 thousand, due to continued focus on potential acquisition opportunities. Generally, we expect asset acquisition expenses to be repaid over time from income generated by acquisitions. However, any particular period may reflect significant expenses arising from third party legal, engineering, and consulting fees that are incurred in the early to mid-stages of due diligence.\nOther expenses for the for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $500 thousand compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily related to (i) a loss on settlement of ARO related to the decommissioning of a segment of the GIGS pipeline system during 2018 and (ii) a non-cash gain recorded on settlement of accounts payable in the prior year.\nDepreciation, Amortization and ARO Accretion Expense. Depreciation, amortization and ARO accretion expense was $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $900 thousand increase was primarily driven by an increase in ARO depreciation based on updates made to the estimated useful lives of certain segments of GIGS at the end of 2017.\nProvision for loan gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for loan gain of approximately $37 thousand related to the satisfaction of the SWD loans with Four Wood Corridor upon sale of the assets securing the loans to Compass SWD, LLC in exchange for (i) a new loan agreement with Compass SWD, LLC for $1.3 million and (ii) cash proceeds from the sale recognized as principal payments on the SWD loans. There were no loan (gain) loss provisions recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Distributions and Other Income. Net distributions and other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $107 thousand compared to $680 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The portion of distributions and dividends deemed to be income versus a return of capital in any period are estimated at the time such distributions are received. These estimates may be subsequently revised based on information received from the portfolio company after their tax reporting periods are concluded. The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross cash distributions and dividend income received from our investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to the net distributions and other income recorded as income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross cash distributions and other income received from investment securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>949,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (dividend income) which have been reclassified as income (return of capital) in a subsequent period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions and dividends received in current period deemed a return of capital and not recorded as income (recorded as a cost reduction) in the current period\n</td> <td>663,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net distributions and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, the decline in net distributions and dividends recorded as income versus the prior-year period was primarily due to (i) the sale of a large portion of the Lightfoot investment as a result of the Arc Logistics merger with Zenith, completed on December 21, 2017 and (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Other Equity Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a net loss on other equity securities of $1.8 million and a net gain on other equity securities of $1.5 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $3.4 million. The net gain and loss recorded are directly related to fluctuations in the valuation, sale and liquidation plan of our investments in private securities. The net loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to (i) the sale of our equity interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018. The net gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to gains realized related to Lightfoot upon completion of the Arc Logistics merger and valuation of the remaining investment in the Lightfoot LP and GP interests. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 10 (\"Fair Value\") for additional information.\nInterest Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest expense totaled approximately $12.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. This increase was attributable to (i) increased interest on the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility during 2018 as a result of the refinancing with Prudential on December 29, 2017, partially offset by (ii) interest incurred on outstanding borrowings on the CorEnergy Revolver and CorEnergy Term Loan during the prior year.\nGain on the sale of leased property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the sale of leased property totaling approximately $11.7 million was recorded in connection with the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility to Zenith Terminals on December 21, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\"). There was no gain on the sale of leased property recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $337 thousand was recorded in connection with entering into the amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility on July 28, 2017 and Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility on December 29, 2017. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\").\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increased benefit in 2018 was primarily attributable to (i) higher losses generated by our TRS subsidiaries and (ii) the capital losses generated from the sale of our interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest that will be carried back against capital gains generated from the sale of a portion of the Lightfoot investment in the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to (i) the transition tax adjustment associated with application of lower effective tax rates from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 to existing deferred tax asset balances at our TRS entities, (ii) the write-off of certain deferred tax assets in connection with the reorganization of Omega from a TRS subsidiary to a qualified REIT subsidiary and (iii) realized and unrealized gains recorded associated with our Lightfoot investment.\nNet Income. Net income was $43.7 million and $34.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $9.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net income attributable to CorEnergy stockholders was $43.7 million and $32.6 million, respectively. After deducting $9.5 million and $8.0 million for the portion of preferred dividends that are allocable to each respective period, net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.2 million, or $2.86 per basic and $2.79 diluted common share, as compared to $24.6 million, or $2.07 per basic and diluted common share, for the prior year.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Equity Attributable to CorEnergy Stockholders per Share\nAs of December 31, 2019, our common equity increased by approximately $21.8 million to $351.2 million from $329.5 million as of December 31, 2018. This increase principally consists of: (i) $66.1 million of common stock issued pursuant to exchanges and conversion of 7.00% Convertible Notes and (ii) $404 thousand of common stock issued pursuant to reinvestment of dividends through the dividend reinvestment plan; partially offset by (iii) net loss attributable to CorEnergy common stockholders of approximately $5.2 million and (iv) dividends paid to our stockholders of approximately $39.5 million.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value Per Common Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analysis of Equity\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 7.375%, $125,493,175 and $125,555,675 liquidation preference ($2,500 per share, $0.001 par value), 10,000,000 authorized; 50,197 and 50,222 issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,493,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,555,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital stock, non-convertible, $0.001 par value; 13,638,916 and 11,960,225 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (100,000,000 shares authorized)\n</td> <td>13,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid-in capital\n</td> <td>360,844,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,295,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings (deficit)\n</td> <td>(9,611,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,147,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CorEnergy Stockholders' Equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476,739,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455,011,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtract: 7.375% Series A Preferred Stock\n</td> <td>(125,493,175\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125,555,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CorEnergy Common Equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351,246,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,455,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>13,638,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,960,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value per Common Share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use certain financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Report include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"EBITDAre\"); EBITDAre as adjusted in the manner described below (\"Adjusted EBITDAre\"); NAREIT funds from operations (\"NAREIT FFO\"); funds from operations adjusted for securities investments (\"FFO\"); and FFO as further adjusted in the manner described below (\"AFFO\"). These supplemental measures are used by our management team and are presented because we believe they help investors understand our business, performance and ability to earn and distribute cash to our stockholders by providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income. The presentation of EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO, FFO and AFFO are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe offer these measures to assist the users of our financial statements in assessing our operating performance under U.S. GAAP, but these measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered measures of liquidity, alternatives to net income or indicators of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including capital expenditures (if any), to make payments on our indebtedness or to make distributions. Our method of calculating these measures may be different from methods used by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income, cash flows from operating activities or revenues.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors and lenders may use to evaluate our ongoing operating results, including (i) the performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets and (ii) the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. EBITDAre, as established by NAREIT, is defined as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre represents EBITDAre adjusted for net realized and unrealized (gain) loss on securities, non-cash; (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; provision for loan (gain) loss; preferred dividend requirements; distributions and dividends received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (recorded as a cost reduction) and reclassified as income in a subsequent period; (gain) loss on settlement of ARO; and non-cash settlement of accounts payable.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our presentation of EBITDAre is calculated in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDAre. In addition, although EBITDAre is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing to non-REITs. Adjusted EBITDAre presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered measures of liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, net income or other indicators of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,175,973\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,163,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,648,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>10,578,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,759,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,378,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization, and ARO accretion\n</td> <td>22,581,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,947,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,047,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sale of leased property, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,723,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(234,618\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,418,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,345,318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-controlling interest attributable to depreciation, amortization, and interest expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,283,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDAre(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,219,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,727,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,137,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>33,960,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan gain\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred dividend requirements\n</td> <td>9,255,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,548,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,953,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions and dividends received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (recorded as a cost reduction) and reclassified as income in a subsequent period(2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on settlement of ARO\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on securities, non-cash(3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,845,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,410,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash settlement of accounts payable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAre(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,435,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,395,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,944,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Effective March 31, 2018, we now present EBITDAre, reported in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, and Adjusted EBITDAre as supplemental measures of our performance.

As defined by NAREIT, NAREIT FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses of depreciable properties, real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs or loan origination costs) and other adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and non-controlling interests. Adjustments for non-controlling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO attributable to common stockholders as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock. Our method of calculating FFO attributable to common stockholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, as such, may not be comparable.\nFFO ADJUSTED FOR SECURITIES INVESTMENTS (FFO)\nDue to the legacy investments that we held, we have also historically presented a measure of FFO, to which we refer herein as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments which is derived by further adjusting NAREIT FFO for distributions received from investment securities, income tax expense (benefit) from investment securities, net distributions and other income and net realized and unrealized gain or loss on other equity securities.\nWe present NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is a key measure we use in assessing performance and in making resource allocation decisions.\nBoth NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions, and that may also be the case with certain of the energy infrastructure assets in which we invest. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments exclude depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items. As such, these performance measures provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income when compared to prior-year periods. These metrics reflect the impact to operations from trends in base and participating rents, company operating costs, development activities, and interest costs.\nWe calculate NAREIT FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002) and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment as NAREIT FFO with additional adjustments described above due to our legacy investments. This may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly may not be comparable to such other REITs. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital for replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments, as we have historically reported, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our liquidity, or as an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or to service our indebtedness.\nAFFO\nManagement uses AFFO as a measure of long-term sustainable operational performance. AFFO in excess of dividends is used for debt repayment, capital reinvestment activities, funding our ARO liability, or other commitments and uncertainties which are necessary to sustain our dividend over the long term. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our liquidity, or as an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or service our indebtedness.\nFor completeness, the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and our calculations of NAREIT FFO, FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments, and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. AFFO is a supplemental, non-GAAP financial measure which we define as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment plus (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for loan (gain) loss, net of tax, transaction costs, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of deferred lease costs, accretion of asset retirement obligation, amortization of above market leases, income tax expense (benefit) unrelated to securities investments, non-cash costs associated with derivative instruments, (gain) loss on the settlement of ARO, and certain costs of a nonrecurring nature, less maintenance, capital expenditures (if any), amortization of debt premium, and other adjustments as deemed appropriate by Management.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of our stockholder distributions include lease revenue and transportation and distribution revenue from our real property assets. Deterioration in the cash flows generated by any of these sources may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders. Based on our current asset base, we target a ratio of AFFO to dividends of 1.5 times. We believe that this level of coverage provides a prudent reserve level to achieve dividend stability and growth over the long term. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our ratio of AFFO to dividends is 1.35 times, which is below our target ratio.\nTo maintain AFFO coverage in 2020, we believe that a number of actions can be taken to adequately offset the lost revenue from the sale of the Portland Terminal, which include deleveraging of our balance sheet through preferred equity and debt repurchases, at attractive market prices. However, in the current market, we believe it is prudent to hold the net cash proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note Offering to utilize in additional investments in revenue generating assets. We regularly assess our ability to pay and to grow our dividend to common stockholders, and there is no assurance that we will continue to make regular dividend payments at current levels.\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and distributions to preferred stockholders are recorded when declared by the Board of Directors. The characterization of any distribution for federal income tax purposes will not be determined until after the end of the taxable year. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 6 (\"Income Taxes\") included in this Report for information on characterization of distributions for federal income tax purposes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nA REIT is generally required to distribute during the taxable year an amount equal to at least 90 percent of the REIT taxable income (determined under Internal Revenue Code section 857(b)(2), without regard to the deduction for dividends paid). We intend to adhere to this requirement in order to maintain our REIT status. The Board of Directors will continue to determine the amount of any distribution that we expect to pay our stockholders. Dividend payouts may be affected by cash flow requirements and remain subject to other risks and uncertainties.\nThe following table sets forth common stock distributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Because certain of our assets may not produce REIT-qualifying income or be treated as interests in real property, those assets are held in wholly-owned TRSs in order to limit the potential that such assets and income could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for 2013 and subsequent years and generally will not pay federal income tax on taxable income of the REIT that is distributed to our stockholders. As a REIT, our distributions from earnings and profits will be treated as ordinary income and a return of capital, and generally will not qualify as qualified dividend income (\"QDI\"). To the extent that the REIT had accumulated C corporation earnings and profits from the periods prior to 2013, we distributed such earnings and profits in 2013. In addition, to the extent we receive taxable distributions from our TRSs, or the REIT received distributions of C corporation earnings and profits, such portion of our distribution is generally treated as QDI. While regular REIT dividends are not eligible for the reduced QDI tax rates, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, Section 199A of the Code typically permits a 20 percent deduction against taxable income for noncorporate taxpayers for qualified business income, which includes dividends from a REIT received during the tax year that is not a capital gain dividend or a dividend qualifying for the QDI rate, subject to certain income and holding period limitations.\nAs a REIT, we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more wholly-owned TRSs. Our use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. As was done with our subsidiary Omega in 2017, and as warranted in the future, we may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to our C corporation or other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.\nOur other equity securities are limited partnerships or limited liability companies which are treated as partnerships for federal and state income tax purposes. As a limited partner, we report our allocable share of taxable income in computing our taxable income. To the extent held by a TRS, the TRS's tax expense or benefit is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the component of income or gains and losses to which such expense or benefit relates. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nIf we cease to qualify as a REIT, we, as a C corporation, would be obligated to pay federal and state income tax on our taxable income. For 2019, the federal income tax rate for a corporation was 21 percent.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The 2017 Tax Act also repealed the alternative minimum tax for corporations. We completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in 2018. We remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the updated rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which resulted in a $1.3 million transition adjustment that reduced net deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the impact of new tax legislation, as well as any future regulations and updates provided by the tax authorities. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 6 (\"Income Taxes\") for additional information.\nMAJOR TENANTS\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had two significant leases. For additional information concerning these leases, see Part I, Item 2, \"Properties\" and Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") included in this Report.

This section provides additional information concerning material developments related to our asset portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019 and through the date of this Report.\nGrand Isle Gathering System\nOn October 18, 2018, EGC was acquired by an affiliate of the privately-held Gulf of Mexico operator, Cox Oil, for approximately $322.0 million. With the purchase of EGC by Cox Oil, it is anticipated that EGC will remain a separate subsidiary owned by an affiliate of Cox Oil and that EGC (not Cox Oil) will continue to be the guarantor of the tenant's obligation under the Lease Agreement. To date, EGC has met its obligations to make lease payments. We are currently engaged in efforts to enforce the reporting requirements in the lease. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\").\nPinedale LGS\nEffective August 8, 2019, UPL's common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and commenced trading on the OTCQX marketplace under the symbol \"UPLC.\" UPL plans to continue to make all required SEC filings, including those on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and will remain subject to all SEC rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOn September 16, 2019, UPL announced that it entered into an amended credit facility to remove financial maintenance covenants among other provisional changes, while also announcing plans to suspend its drilling program by the end of September while natural gas pricing remains near multi-year lows. In connection with the approved credit facility amendment, UPL also announced a fall borrowing base redetermination of $1.175 billion, including $200 million of the commitment allocated to the credit facility. The amended credit facility also established maximum capital expenditures of $65 million, $10 million and $5 million, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and quarterly thereafter.\nOn November 7, 2019, UPL updated full-year 2019 capital investment guidance to a range of $240 million to $250 million. UPL also announced expected 2020 production to be between 182 and 192 Bcfe, which assumes suspended drilling and the maximum capital expenditures outlined above. UPL also stated it continues proactive efforts to reduce debt and affirms its ongoing advisor engagements that are focused on liability management and assisting management and its board of directors in evaluating a range of strategic alternatives.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 18, 2020, UPL announced a spring borrowing base redetermination, effective April 1, 2020, which will reduce the borrowing base to $1.075 billion, with $100 million of the commitment attributed to its credit facility. Additionally, UPL announced full-year 2019 production of 240.2 Bcfe.\nMoGas Pipeline\nEffective March 1, 2017, MoGas entered into a long-term firm transportation services agreement with Spire, its largest customer. The agreement extends the termination date for Spire's existing firm transportation agreement to October 31, 2030. During the entire extended term, Spire will continue to reserve 62,800 dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity on MoGas. This service continued at the full tariff rate of $12.385 per dekatherm per month until October 31, 2018, at which time the rate was reduced to $6.386 per dekatherm per month for the remainder of the agreement.\nOn May 31, 2018, MoGas filed a general rate case before FERC. The proposed change in rates sought to (i) recover increases in capital, operating and maintenance expenditures incurred; (ii) mitigate for the substantial decrease in volumes due to the loss of a firm transportation contract with a St. Louis natural gas marketing entity; (iii) mitigate for the substantial decrease in revenue from Spire; and (iv) reflect changes in the corporate income tax rate associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The proposed rates went into effect on December 1, 2018. On August 22, 2019, the FERC approved a settlement agreed to by MoGas and all intervenors in the rate case to provide annual rates of approximately $14.8 million, effective September 1, 2019. As a result of the approved and effective settlement, MoGas has begun to refund the difference between the filed rates and the settlement rates. In conjunction with the settlement, MoGas entered into 5-year firm transportation service agreements with its customers in exchange for modest discounts. The agreements, which amend prior year-to-year agreements, extend the termination date for the existing firm transportation service agreements to December 31, 2023.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Notional Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pinedale LP Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,944,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,528,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,416,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on Pinedale LP Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,107,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,607,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.00% Convertible Debt(1)\n</td> <td>2,092,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,092,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on 7.00% Convertible Debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% Convertible Debt\n</td> <td>120,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on 5.875% Convertible Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,108,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,909,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,123,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Subsequent to December 31, 2019, holders of the 7.00% Convertible Notes converted $416 thousand face amount of notes for 12,605 shares of common stock, reducing (i) the 7.00% Convertible Notes outstanding to $1.7 million and (ii) interest expense to $59 thousand in 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFees paid to Corridor under the Management Agreement and the Administrative Agreement are not included because they vary as a function of the value of our total asset base. For additional information see Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") included in this Report.\nSEASONALITY\nOur operating companies, MoGas and Omega, have stable revenues throughout the year and will complete necessary pipeline maintenance during the \"non-heating\" season, or quarters two and three. Therefore, operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have, and are not expected to have, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION\nDeflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction, and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or to refinance our properties and our tenants' ability to obtain credit. During inflationary\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nperiods, we intend for substantially all of our tenant leases to be designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. Often, our leases include rent escalators that are based on the CPI, or other agreed upon metrics that increase with inflation.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2019, we had liquidity of approximately $257.3 million comprised of cash of $120.9 million plus revolver availability of $136.4 million. During 2019, our liquidity was enhanced by the net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note offering, partially offset by cash utilized to complete two exchanges of the 7.00% Convertible Notes. The results of the MoGas rate case settlement discussed in the \"Asset Portfolio and Related Developments\" section above had a positive impact on revolver availability at the end of 2019 and going forward.\nWe use cash flows generated from our operations to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service payments and dividend payments. Management expects that future operating cash flows, along with access to financial markets, will be sufficient to fund future operating requirements and acquisition opportunities. If our ability to access the capital markets is restricted, as currently is the case as discussed in Part IV, Item 15, Note 13 (\"Stockholders' Equity\") or if debt or equity capital were unavailable on favorable terms, or at all, our ability to fund acquisition opportunities or to comply with the REIT distribution rules could be adversely affected.\nThere are acquisition opportunities that are in preliminary stages of review, and consummation of any of these opportunities may depend on a number of factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that any of these acquisition opportunities will result in consummated transactions. As part of our disciplined investment philosophy, we plan to use a moderate level of leverage, approximately 25 percent to 50 percent of assets, supplemented with accretive equity issuance as needed, subject to current market conditions.

The amended facility provides for commitments of up to $161.0 million, comprised of (i) increased commitments on the CorEnergy Revolver of up to $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base limitations, and (ii) a $1.0 million commitment on the MoGas Revolver.\nThe amended facility has a 5-year term maturing on July 28, 2022, and provided for a springing maturity on February 28, 2020, and thereafter, if we failed to meet certain liquidity requirements from the springing maturity date through the maturity of our 7.00% Convertible Notes on June 15, 2020. This springing maturity would have been triggered on the first date on or after February 28, 2020 that both (i) the outstanding principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes exceeded $28,750,000 and (ii) our unrestricted cash liquidity (including, for purposes of this calculation, the undrawn portion of the Borrowing Base then available for borrowing under the CorEnergy Credit Facility) was less than the sum of (x) the outstanding principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes plus (y) $5,000,000. We will not trigger the springing maturity as a result of the 7.00% Convertible Note exchange completed in August of 2019, which reduced the outstanding principal balance of the 7.00% Convertible Notes below the springing maturity threshold. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for further details on convertible debt transactions.\nUnder the terms of the amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility, we are subject to certain financial covenants as follows: (i) a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 2.0 to 1.0; (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0; (iii) a maximum senior secured recourse leverage ratio (which generally excludes debt from certain subsidiaries that are not obligors under the CorEnergy Credit Facility) of 3.0 to 1.0.; and (iv) a maximum total funded debt to capitalization ratio of 50 percent. In addition, there is a covenant related to our ability to make distributions that is tied to AFFO and applicable REIT distribution requirements, and provides that, in the absence of any acceleration of maturity following an Event of Default, we may make distributions equal to the greater of the amount required to maintain our REIT status and 100 percent of AFFO for the trailing 12-month period.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings under the credit facility will typically bear interest on the outstanding principal amount using a LIBOR pricing grid that is expected to equal a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 percent to 3.75 percent, based on our senior secured recourse leverage ratio. The facility contains, among other restrictions, certain default and cross-default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods), all of which are substantially the same as under the prior facility.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019 and had approximately $136.4 million of available borrowing capacity on the CorEnergy Revolver. For a summary of the additional material terms of the CorEnergy Credit Facility, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report.\nAmended Pinedale Term Credit Facility\nIn December 2012, Pinedale LP entered into a $70.0 million secured term credit facility with a lender that provided for monthly payments of principal and interest and was secured by the Pinedale LGS. The credit facility accrued interest at a variable annual rate linked to LIBOR.\nOn March 30, 2016, we and Prudential (collectively, \"the Refinancing Lenders\"), refinanced the remaining $58.5 million principal balance of the $70.0 million credit facility (on a pro rata basis equal to the respective equity interests in Pinedale LP, with our 81.05 percent share being approximately $47.4 million) and executed a series of agreements assigning the credit facility to the Refinancing Lenders, with CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. as Agent for the Refinancing Lenders. Our portion of the debt and interest was eliminated in consolidation and Prudential's portion of the debt was shown as a related-party liability.\nOn December 29, 2017, Pinedale LP entered into the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility, with Prudential and a group of lenders affiliated with Prudential as lenders and Prudential serving as administrative agent. The new amended facility is a 5-year $41.0 million term loan facility, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.5 percent, which matures on December 29, 2022. Principal payments of $294 thousand, plus accrued interest, are payable monthly. Proceeds from the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility were utilized by Pinedale LP to pay off the balance due to the Refinancing Lenders under the previously existing Pinedale LP credit facility. We utilized our portion of the proceeds from the repayment of the prior facility to finance the purchase of Prudential's 18.95 percent outstanding equity interest in Pinedale LP.\nThe Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility limits distributions by Pinedale LP to us, although such distributions are permitted to the extent required for us to maintain REIT qualification so long as Pinedale LP's obligations under the credit facility have not been accelerated following an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended Term Credit Facility).\nOutstanding balances under the facility are secured by the Pinedale LGS assets. The Amended Term Credit Facility is subject to (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0, (ii) a maximum leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.0 and (iii) a minimum net worth of $115.0 million, each measured at the Pinedale LP level and not at the Company level. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019. For a summary of the additional material terms of the Pinedale Credit Facility, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information.\nMoGas Revolver\nIn conjunction with the MoGas Transaction, MoGas Pipeline LLC and United Property Systems, LLC, as co-borrowers, entered into a revolving credit agreement dated November 24, 2014 (the \"MoGas Revolver\"), with certain lenders, including Regions Bank as agent for such lenders. Following subsequent amendments and restatements made on July 8, 2015 and July 28, 2017 in connection with the amendments and restatements of the CorEnergy Credit Facility, discussed above, commitments under the MoGas Revolver were reduced from the original level of $3.0 million to a current total of $1.0 million. Interest accrues under the MoGas Revolver at the same rate and pursuant to the same terms as it accrues under the CorEnergy Revolver. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") for further information. As of December 31, 2019, the co-borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no borrowings outstanding on the MoGas Revolver.\nMowood/Omega Revolver\nOn July 31, 2015, a $1.5 million revolving line of credit (\"Mowood/Omega Revolver\") was established with Regions Bank with a maturity date of July 31, 2016. Following annual extensions, the current maturity of the facility has been amended and extended to July 31, 2020. The Mowood/Omega Revolver is used by Omega for working capital and general business purposes and is guaranteed and secured by the assets of Omega. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus 4 percent and is payable monthly in arrears with no unused fee. There was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2019.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConvertible Notes\n7.00% Convertible Notes\nOn June 29, 2015, we completed a public offering of $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2020. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 7.0 percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015.\nAs authorized by our Board of Directors, during May 2016, we repurchased $1.0 million of face value of 7.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, certain holders elected to convert $42 thousand of 7.00% Convertible Notes for 1,271 shares of our common stock.\nOn January 16, 2019, we agreed with three holders of our 7.00% Convertible Notes, pursuant to privately negotiated agreements, to exchange $43.8 million face amount of such notes for an aggregate of 837,040 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, plus aggregate cash consideration of $19.8 million, including $315 thousand of interest expense. Our agent and lenders under the CorEnergy Credit Facility provided a consent for the convertible note exchange. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $5.0 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the first quarter of 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt included the write-off of a portion of the underwriter's discount and deferred debt costs of $409 thousand and $27 thousand, respectively.\nOn August 15, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the 5.875% Convertible Notes discussed further below, together with shares of our common stock, to exchange $63.9 million face amount of its 7.00% Convertible Notes pursuant to privately negotiated agreements with three holders. The total cash and stock consideration for the exchange was valued at approximately $93.2 million. This included an aggregate of 703,432 shares of common stock plus cash consideration of approximately $60.2 million, including $733 thousand of interest expense. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $28.9 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the third quarter of 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt included the write-off of a portion of the underwriter's discount and deferred debt costs of $360 thousand and $24 thousand, respectively. Collectively, for the two exchange transactions described above, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, certain holders elected to convert $4.2 million of 7.00% Convertible Notes for approximately 127,143 shares of common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has $2.1 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Notes outstanding.\nAt the present time, we may not redeem the remaining 7.00% Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date without the consent of the agent and lenders of the CorEnergy Credit Facility. Holders may convert their 7.00% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at their option until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The current conversion rate for the 7.00% Convertible Notes is 30.3030 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $33.00 per share of our common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events as specified in the Indenture.\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information concerning the 7.00% Convertible Notes.\n5.875% Convertible Notes\nOn August 12, 2019, we completed a private placement offering of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 to the initial purchasers of such notes for cash in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The initial purchasers then resold the 5.875% Convertible Notes for cash equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount thereof to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A. The 5.875% Convertible Notes mature on August 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 5.875 percent per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2020.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their 5.875% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The initial conversion rate for the 5.875% Convertible Notes is 20.0 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.875% Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $50.00 per share of our common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events as specified in the Indenture.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information concerning the 5.875% Convertible Notes.\nShelf Registration Statements\nOn October 30, 2018, we registered 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under our dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to a separate shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued 22,003 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to the shelf resulting in remaining availability (subject to the current limitation discussed below) of approximately 977,997 shares of common stock.\nOn November 9, 2018, we had a new shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC replacing our previously filed shelf registration statement, pursuant to which we may publicly offer additional debt or equity securities with an aggregate offering price of up to $600.0 million. As described elsewhere in this Report, EGC and Cox Oil have refused to provide the financial statement information concerning EGC that we must file pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X. At least until we are able to file these EGC financial statements, we do not expect to be able to use this shelf registration statement, or the shelf registration statement filed for our dividend reinvestment plan, to sell our securities.\nWe have engaged in dialogue with the staff of the SEC in an effort to shorten the period during which we do not use our registration statements. We do not expect this period to be shortened until the EGC financial statement information has been received and filed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such relief.\nLiquidity and Capitalization\nOur principal investing activities are acquiring and financing midstream and downstream real estate assets within the U.S. energy infrastructure sector and concurrently entering into long-term triple-net participating leases with energy companies. These investing activities have often been financed from the proceeds of our public equity and debt offerings as well as the term and credit facilities mentioned above. Continued growth of our asset portfolio will depend in part on our continued ability to access funds through additional borrowings and securities offerings. Additionally, our liquidity and capitalization may be impacted by the optional redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. As disclosed in Part IV, Item 15, Note 13 (\"Stockholders' Equity\"), the depositary shares may be redeemed on or after January 27, 2020, at our option, in whole or in part, at the $25.00 liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of redemption.\nThe following table presents our liquidity and capitalization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capitalization\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,863,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,287,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,358,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,721,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (including current maturities) (1)\n</td> <td>152,109,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,038,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockholders' equity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 7.375%, $0.001 par value\n</td> <td>125,493,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,555,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital stock, non-convertible, $0.001 par value\n</td> <td>13,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid-in capital\n</td> <td>360,844,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,295,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings (deficit)\n</td> <td>(9,611,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,147,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CorEnergy equity\n</td> <td>476,739,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455,011,305\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CorEnergy capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628,848,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,049,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Long-term debt is presented net of discount and deferred debt costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also have two lines of credit for working capital purposes for two of our subsidiaries with maximum availability of $1.5 million and $1.0 million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor additional information regarding transactions that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2019, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 16 (\"Subsequent Events\") included in this annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe financial statements included in this Report are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSee Part IV, Item 15, Note 2 (\"Significant Accounting Policies\") included in this Report for further information related to our significant accounting policies.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of a subsea midstream pipeline system, liquids gathering system and natural gas pipelines that have been obtained through a business combination and asset acquisitions. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and improvements, which extend the useful lives of our assets, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment, and performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired. When a triggering event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we utilize cash flow projections to assess the ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from the evaluation of goodwill, for which the recoverability assessment utilizes fair value estimates that include discounted cash flows in the estimation process, and accordingly any goodwill impairment recognized may not be indicative of a similar impairment of the related underlying long-lived assets.\nThe projected cash flows of long-lived assets are primarily based on contractual cash flows relating to existing leases that extend many years into the future. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value that would be received if the asset were sold, discount rates, and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can differ from our estimates. There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe follow ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset. We recognized an existing ARO in conjunction with the acquisition of the GIGS in June 2015.\nWe measure changes in the ARO liability due to passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the amount of the liability at the beginning of the period. The increase in the carrying amount of the liability is recognized as an expense classified as an operating item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, hereinafter referred to as ARO accretion expense. We periodically reassess the timing and amount of cash flows anticipated associated with the ARO and adjusts the fair value of the liability accordingly under the guidance in ASC 410-20.\nThe fair value of the obligation at the acquisition date was capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and is being depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. The useful lives of most pipeline gathering systems are primarily derived from available supply resources and ultimate consumption of those resources by end users. Adjustments to the ARO resulting from reassessments of the timing and amount of cash flows will result in changes to the retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset.\nUpon decommissioning of the ARO or a portion thereof, we reduce the fair value of the liability and recognize a (gain) loss on settlement of ARO as an operating item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the difference between the liability and actual decommissioning costs incurred.\nFederal and State Income Taxation\nWe qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and intend to continue to remain so qualified. For further information, see \"Federal and State Income Taxation\" above in this Item 7 and \"Federal and State Income Taxation\" under\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 5 \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" of this Report.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this Report.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and we can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information.\nBUSINESS OBJECTIVE\nCorEnergy primarily owns and seeks to own assets in the U.S. energy sector that perform utility-like functions, such as pipelines, storage terminals, rail terminals and gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. We also may provide other types of capital, including loans secured by energy infrastructure assets. Our objective has been to generate long-term contracted revenue from operators of our assets, primarily under triple-net participating leases without direct commodity price exposure. As a result of having received the PLR, we are now able to consider, and are considering, a broader set of investment opportunities than was available to us prior to issuance of the PLR. For additional information, see \"Company Overview\" in Item 1 of this Report.\nThe assets are primarily mission-critical, in that utilization of the assets is necessary for the business the operators of those assets seek to conduct and their rental payments are an essential operating expense. We acquire assets that will enhance the stability of our dividend through diversification, while offering the potential for long-term distribution growth. These sale-leaseback or real property mortgage transactions provide the energy company with a source of capital that is an alternative to sources such as corporate borrowing,\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nbond offerings, or equity offerings. We believe our leadership team's energy and utility expertise provides CorEnergy with a competitive advantage to acquire, own and lease U.S. energy infrastructure assets in a tax-efficient, transparent and investor-friendly REIT.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc., as of December 31, 2019, and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the financial data and key operating statistics for CorEnergy for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

2018\nRevenue. Consolidated revenues were $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $3.3 million. Lease revenue was $67.1 million and $72.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the decrease of approximately $5.7 million driven primarily by (i) the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility, partially offset by (ii) an increase in variable rent collected on the Pinedale lease during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransportation and distribution revenue from our subsidiaries MoGas and Omega was $18.8 million and $16.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $2.3 million increase primarily resulted from higher rates going into effect on December 1, 2018 related to the rate case filed by MoGas with the FERC, net of the final refund liability. The FERC rate case settlement was approved in August of 2019. Refer to \"Asset Portfolio and Related Developments\" for further discussion related to the FERC rate case settlement.\nTransportation and Distribution Expenses. Transportation and distribution expenses were $5.2 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $2.0 million. The decrease relates primarily to lower legal, consulting and maintenance costs at MoGas.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The most significant components of the variance from the prior year are outlined in the following table and explained below:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,786,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,591,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and professional fees\n</td> <td>2,413,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,396,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,691,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,596,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,042,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement fees are directly proportional to our asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2019, management fees decreased $805 thousand compared to the prior year due to (i) cash utilized for the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchange in the first quarter of 2019, (ii) management fee waivers in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 to exclude the net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Notes offering (other than the cash portion of such proceeds utilized in connection with the exchange of the Company's 7.00% Convertible Notes) and (iii) lower incentive fees due to decreased revenue from the sale of the Portland Terminal in December 2018. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") for additional information.\nAcquisition and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.3 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in professional fees. Professional fees decreased $1.0 million during the current year while asset acquisition expenses decreased $336 thousand. Generally, we expect asset acquisition expenses to be repaid over time from income generated by acquisitions. However, any particular period may reflect significant expenses arising from third party legal, engineering, and consulting fees that are incurred in the early to mid-stages of due diligence. The decrease in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to higher legal and consulting costs in the prior year related to monitoring our GIGS asset and the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility, partially offset by legal and consulting costs incurred in the current year related to the ongoing litigation with EGC/Cox Oil. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") for additional information.\nOther expenses for the for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $295 thousand compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to a loss on settlement of ARO related to the decommissioning of a segment of the GIGS pipeline system during the prior year.\nDepreciation, Amortization and ARO Accretion Expense. Depreciation, amortization and ARO accretion expense was $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $2.4 million decrease was primarily driven by depreciation expense, which decreased approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense was driven by (i) the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility in December of 2018 and (ii) updates made to the estimated useful lives of certain ARO segments of GIGS at the end of 2018.\nProvision for loan gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for loan gain of approximately $37 thousand related to the satisfaction of the SWD loans with Four Wood Corridor upon sale of the assets securing the loans to Compass SWD, LLC in exchange for (i) a new loan agreement with Compass SWD, LLC for $1.3 million and (ii) cash proceeds from the sale recognized as principal payments on the SWD loans. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 5 (\"Financing Notes Receivable\"). There were no loan (gain) loss provisions recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Distributions and Other Income. Net distributions and other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.3 million compared to $107 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to interest income, which increased approximately $1.2 million from the prior-year period, due to a higher cash balance maintained during 2019. Net distributions of approximately $0.1 million recognized for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were impacted by (i) the sale of a large portion of the Lightfoot investment as a result of the Arc Logistics merger with Zenith, completed on December 21, 2017, (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018 and (iii) and the liquidation of Lightfoot at the end of 2019.\nThe portion of distributions and dividends deemed to be income versus a return of capital in any period are estimated at the time such distributions are received. These estimates may be subsequently revised based on information received from the portfolio company after their tax reporting periods are concluded. The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross cash distributions and dividend income received from our investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 to the net distributions and other income recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross cash distributions and other income received from investment securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,328,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (dividend income) which have been reclassified as income (return of capital) in a subsequent period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions and dividends received in current period deemed a return of capital and not recorded as income (recorded as a cost reduction) in the current period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>663,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net distributions and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,328,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Realized and Unrealized Loss on Other Equity Securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss on other equity securities of $1.8 million. The net loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to valuation considerations surrounding the arbitration award delivered to Eni USA and Gulf LNG as well as other market information. Due to the sale or asset disposition related to our investment securities at the end of 2018 and the liquidation of the remaining investment interest at the end of 2019, we no longer have an interest in other equity securities.\nInterest Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expense totaled approximately $10.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in interest expense as a result of the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchanges and conversions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by (ii) additional interest expense from the 5.875% Convertible Notes Offering in August of 2019. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\").\nGain on the sale of leased property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the sale of leased property totaling approximately $11.7 million was recorded in connection with the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility to Zenith Terminals on December 21, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\"). There was no gain on the sale of leased property recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $34.0 million was recorded in connection with the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchanges completed in the first and third quarters of 2019. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\"). There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense was $235 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The income tax expense recorded in the current year is primarily the result of (i) a change in our state effective rate due to changes in state law and state operations by certain of our TRS entities, (ii) certain fixed asset, deferred contract revenue and loan loss activities, partially offset by (iii) the impact of the refund liability related to the FERC rate case settlement and (iv) capital losses generated from the Lightfoot liquidation that will be carried back against capital gains from prior years. The income tax benefit recorded in the prior year was primarily attributable to (i) higher losses generated by our TRS subsidiaries and (ii) the capital losses generated from the sale of our interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest that were carried back against capital gains generated from the sale of a portion of the Lightfoot investment in prior years.\nNet Income. Net income was $4.1 million and $43.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $39.6 million. After deducting $9.3 million and $9.5 million for the portion of preferred dividends that are allocable to each respective period, net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $(5.2) million, or $(0.40) per basic and diluted common share, as compared to $34.2 million, or $2.86 per basic and $2.79 diluted common share, for the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. Consolidated revenues were $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $482 thousand. Lease revenue was $72.7 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with the increase of approximately $3.9 million driven primarily by variable rent collected on the Pinedale lease during 2018. Transportation and distribution revenue from our subsidiaries MoGas and Omega was $16.5 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $3.5 million decrease primarily resulted from a change to straight-line revenue recognition on MoGas' long-term contract with Spire under the new revenue recognition standard that was adopted on January 1, 2018. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.2 million lower under the new accounting standard. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 4 (\"Transportation And Distribution Revenue\") for additional details.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransportation and Distribution Expenses. Transportation and distribution expenses were $7.2 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $481 thousand. The increase relates primarily to MoGas, which had higher legal and consulting costs during 2018 related to the FERC rate case. The increase was partially offset by lower costs from the timing of projects performed by Omega for Fort Leonard Wood.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The most significant components of the variance from the prior year are outlined in the following table and explained below: Table 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,591,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,213,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and professional fees\n</td> <td>3,759,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,380,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,691,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,191,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,042,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,786,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement fees are directly proportional to our asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2018, management fees increased $378 thousand compared to the prior year due to the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Pinedale LP, which closed on December 29, 2017. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") for additional information.\nAcquisition and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.4 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in professional fees. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to (i) higher legal and consulting costs in the current-year related to monitoring our GIGS asset, (ii) higher legal and consulting fees related to the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility and (iii) a prior-year reimbursement of legal fees received in 2017 for costs incurred during UPL's bankruptcy.\nAsset acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were relatively consistent with the prior year, decreasing $71 thousand, due to continued focus on potential acquisition opportunities. Generally, we expect asset acquisition expenses to be repaid over time from income generated by acquisitions. However, any particular period may reflect significant expenses arising from third party legal, engineering, and consulting fees that are incurred in the early to mid-stages of due diligence.\nOther expenses for the for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $500 thousand compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily related to (i) a loss on settlement of ARO related to the decommissioning of a segment of the GIGS pipeline system during 2018 and (ii) a non-cash gain recorded on settlement of accounts payable in the prior year.\nDepreciation, Amortization and ARO Accretion Expense. Depreciation, amortization and ARO accretion expense was $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $900 thousand increase was primarily driven by an increase in ARO depreciation based on updates made to the estimated useful lives of certain segments of GIGS at the end of 2017.\nProvision for loan gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for loan gain of approximately $37 thousand related to the satisfaction of the SWD loans with Four Wood Corridor upon sale of the assets securing the loans to Compass SWD, LLC in exchange for (i) a new loan agreement with Compass SWD, LLC for $1.3 million and (ii) cash proceeds from the sale recognized as principal payments on the SWD loans. There were no loan (gain) loss provisions recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Distributions and Other Income. Net distributions and other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $107 thousand compared to $680 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The portion of distributions and dividends deemed to be income versus a return of capital in any period are estimated at the time such distributions are received. These estimates may be subsequently revised based on information received from the portfolio company after their tax reporting periods are concluded. The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross cash distributions and dividend income received from our investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to the net distributions and other income recorded as income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross cash distributions and other income received from investment securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>949,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (dividend income) which have been reclassified as income (return of capital) in a subsequent period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions and dividends received in current period deemed a return of capital and not recorded as income (recorded as a cost reduction) in the current period\n</td> <td>663,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net distributions and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, the decline in net distributions and dividends recorded as income versus the prior-year period was primarily due to (i) the sale of a large portion of the Lightfoot investment as a result of the Arc Logistics merger with Zenith, completed on December 21, 2017 and (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Other Equity Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a net loss on other equity securities of $1.8 million and a net gain on other equity securities of $1.5 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $3.4 million. The net gain and loss recorded are directly related to fluctuations in the valuation, sale and liquidation plan of our investments in private securities. The net loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to (i) the sale of our equity interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018. The net gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to gains realized related to Lightfoot upon completion of the Arc Logistics merger and valuation of the remaining investment in the Lightfoot LP and GP interests. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 10 (\"Fair Value\") for additional information.\nInterest Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest expense totaled approximately $12.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. This increase was attributable to (i) increased interest on the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility during 2018 as a result of the refinancing with Prudential on December 29, 2017, partially offset by (ii) interest incurred on outstanding borrowings on the CorEnergy Revolver and CorEnergy Term Loan during the prior year.\nGain on the sale of leased property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the sale of leased property totaling approximately $11.7 million was recorded in connection with the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility to Zenith Terminals on December 21, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\"). There was no gain on the sale of leased property recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $337 thousand was recorded in connection with entering into the amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility on July 28, 2017 and Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility on December 29, 2017. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\").\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increased benefit in 2018 was primarily attributable to (i) higher losses generated by our TRS subsidiaries and (ii) the capital losses generated from the sale of our interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest that will be carried back against capital gains generated from the sale of a portion of the Lightfoot investment in the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to (i) the transition tax adjustment associated with application of lower effective tax rates from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 to existing deferred tax asset balances at our TRS entities, (ii) the write-off of certain deferred tax assets in connection with the reorganization of Omega from a TRS subsidiary to a qualified REIT subsidiary and (iii) realized and unrealized gains recorded associated with our Lightfoot investment.\nNet Income. Net income was $43.7 million and $34.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $9.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net income attributable to CorEnergy stockholders was $43.7 million and $32.6 million, respectively. After deducting $9.5 million and $8.0 million for the portion of preferred dividends that are allocable to each respective period, net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.2 million, or $2.86 per basic and $2.79 diluted common share, as compared to $24.6 million, or $2.07 per basic and diluted common share, for the prior year.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Equity Attributable to CorEnergy Stockholders per Share\nAs of December 31, 2019, our common equity increased by approximately $21.8 million to $351.2 million from $329.5 million as of December 31, 2018. This increase principally consists of: (i) $66.1 million of common stock issued pursuant to exchanges and conversion of 7.00% Convertible Notes and (ii) $404 thousand of common stock issued pursuant to reinvestment of dividends through the dividend reinvestment plan; partially offset by (iii) net loss attributable to CorEnergy common stockholders of approximately $5.2 million and (iv) dividends paid to our stockholders of approximately $39.5 million.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value Per Common Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analysis of Equity\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 7.375%, $125,493,175 and $125,555,675 liquidation preference ($2,500 per share, $0.001 par value), 10,000,000 authorized; 50,197 and 50,222 issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,493,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,555,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital stock, non-convertible, $0.001 par value; 13,638,916 and 11,960,225 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (100,000,000 shares authorized)\n</td> <td>13,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid-in capital\n</td> <td>360,844,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,295,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings (deficit)\n</td> <td>(9,611,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,147,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CorEnergy Stockholders' Equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476,739,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455,011,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtract: 7.375% Series A Preferred Stock\n</td> <td>(125,493,175\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125,555,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CorEnergy Common Equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351,246,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,455,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>13,638,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,960,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value per Common Share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use certain financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Report include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"EBITDAre\"); EBITDAre as adjusted in the manner described below (\"Adjusted EBITDAre\"); NAREIT funds from operations (\"NAREIT FFO\"); funds from operations adjusted for securities investments (\"FFO\"); and FFO as further adjusted in the manner described below (\"AFFO\"). These supplemental measures are used by our management team and are presented because we believe they help investors understand our business, performance and ability to earn and distribute cash to our stockholders by providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income. The presentation of EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO, FFO and AFFO are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe offer these measures to assist the users of our financial statements in assessing our operating performance under U.S. GAAP, but these measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered measures of liquidity, alternatives to net income or indicators of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including capital expenditures (if any), to make payments on our indebtedness or to make distributions. Our method of calculating these measures may be different from methods used by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income, cash flows from operating activities or revenues.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors and lenders may use to evaluate our ongoing operating results, including (i) the performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets and (ii) the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. EBITDAre, as established by NAREIT, is defined as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre represents EBITDAre adjusted for net realized and unrealized (gain) loss on securities, non-cash; (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; provision for loan (gain) loss; preferred dividend requirements; distributions and dividends received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (recorded as a cost reduction) and reclassified as income in a subsequent period; (gain) loss on settlement of ARO; and non-cash settlement of accounts payable.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our presentation of EBITDAre is calculated in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDAre. In addition, although EBITDAre is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing to non-REITs. Adjusted EBITDAre presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered measures of liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, net income or other indicators of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,175,973\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,163,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,648,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>10,578,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,759,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,378,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization, and ARO accretion\n</td> <td>22,581,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,947,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,047,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sale of leased property, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,723,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(234,618\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,418,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,345,318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-controlling interest attributable to depreciation, amortization, and interest expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,283,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDAre(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,219,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,727,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,137,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>33,960,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan gain\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred dividend requirements\n</td> <td>9,255,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,548,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,953,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions and dividends received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (recorded as a cost reduction) and reclassified as income in a subsequent period(2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on settlement of ARO\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on securities, non-cash(3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,845,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,410,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash settlement of accounts payable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDAre(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,435,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,395,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,944,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Effective March 31, 2018, we now present EBITDAre, reported in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, and Adjusted EBITDAre as supplemental measures of our performance.

As defined by NAREIT, NAREIT FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses of depreciable properties, real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs or loan origination costs) and other adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and non-controlling interests. Adjustments for non-controlling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO attributable to common stockholders as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock. Our method of calculating FFO attributable to common stockholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, as such, may not be comparable.\nFFO ADJUSTED FOR SECURITIES INVESTMENTS (FFO)\nDue to the legacy investments that we held, we have also historically presented a measure of FFO, to which we refer herein as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments which is derived by further adjusting NAREIT FFO for distributions received from investment securities, income tax expense (benefit) from investment securities, net distributions and other income and net realized and unrealized gain or loss on other equity securities.\nWe present NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is a key measure we use in assessing performance and in making resource allocation decisions.\nBoth NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions, and that may also be the case with certain of the energy infrastructure assets in which we invest. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments exclude depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items. As such, these performance measures provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income when compared to prior-year periods. These metrics reflect the impact to operations from trends in base and participating rents, company operating costs, development activities, and interest costs.\nWe calculate NAREIT FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002) and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment as NAREIT FFO with additional adjustments described above due to our legacy investments. This may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly may not be comparable to such other REITs. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital for replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments, as we have historically reported, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our liquidity, or as an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or to service our indebtedness.\nAFFO\nManagement uses AFFO as a measure of long-term sustainable operational performance. AFFO in excess of dividends is used for debt repayment, capital reinvestment activities, funding our ARO liability, or other commitments and uncertainties which are necessary to sustain our dividend over the long term. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our liquidity, or as an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or service our indebtedness.\nFor completeness, the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and our calculations of NAREIT FFO, FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments, and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. AFFO is a supplemental, non-GAAP financial measure which we define as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment plus (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for loan (gain) loss, net of tax, transaction costs, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of deferred lease costs, accretion of asset retirement obligation, amortization of above market leases, income tax expense (benefit) unrelated to securities investments, non-cash costs associated with derivative instruments, (gain) loss on the settlement of ARO, and certain costs of a nonrecurring nature, less maintenance, capital expenditures (if any), amortization of debt premium, and other adjustments as deemed appropriate by Management.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of our stockholder distributions include lease revenue and transportation and distribution revenue from our real property assets. Deterioration in the cash flows generated by any of these sources may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders. Based on our current asset base, we target a ratio of AFFO to dividends of 1.5 times. We believe that this level of coverage provides a prudent reserve level to achieve dividend stability and growth over the long term. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our ratio of AFFO to dividends is 1.35 times, which is below our target ratio.\nTo maintain AFFO coverage in 2020, we believe that a number of actions can be taken to adequately offset the lost revenue from the sale of the Portland Terminal, which include deleveraging of our balance sheet through preferred equity and debt repurchases, at attractive market prices. However, in the current market, we believe it is prudent to hold the net cash proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note Offering to utilize in additional investments in revenue generating assets. We regularly assess our ability to pay and to grow our dividend to common stockholders, and there is no assurance that we will continue to make regular dividend payments at current levels.\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and distributions to preferred stockholders are recorded when declared by the Board of Directors. The characterization of any distribution for federal income tax purposes will not be determined until after the end of the taxable year. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 6 (\"Income Taxes\") included in this Report for information on characterization of distributions for federal income tax purposes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nA REIT is generally required to distribute during the taxable year an amount equal to at least 90 percent of the REIT taxable income (determined under Internal Revenue Code section 857(b)(2), without regard to the deduction for dividends paid). We intend to adhere to this requirement in order to maintain our REIT status. The Board of Directors will continue to determine the amount of any distribution that we expect to pay our stockholders. Dividend payouts may be affected by cash flow requirements and remain subject to other risks and uncertainties.\nThe following table sets forth common stock distributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Because certain of our assets may not produce REIT-qualifying income or be treated as interests in real property, those assets are held in wholly-owned TRSs in order to limit the potential that such assets and income could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for 2013 and subsequent years and generally will not pay federal income tax on taxable income of the REIT that is distributed to our stockholders. As a REIT, our distributions from earnings and profits will be treated as ordinary income and a return of capital, and generally will not qualify as qualified dividend income (\"QDI\"). To the extent that the REIT had accumulated C corporation earnings and profits from the periods prior to 2013, we distributed such earnings and profits in 2013. In addition, to the extent we receive taxable distributions from our TRSs, or the REIT received distributions of C corporation earnings and profits, such portion of our distribution is generally treated as QDI. While regular REIT dividends are not eligible for the reduced QDI tax rates, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, Section 199A of the Code typically permits a 20 percent deduction against taxable income for noncorporate taxpayers for qualified business income, which includes dividends from a REIT received during the tax year that is not a capital gain dividend or a dividend qualifying for the QDI rate, subject to certain income and holding period limitations.\nAs a REIT, we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more wholly-owned TRSs. Our use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. As was done with our subsidiary Omega in 2017, and as warranted in the future, we may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to our C corporation or other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.\nOur other equity securities are limited partnerships or limited liability companies which are treated as partnerships for federal and state income tax purposes. As a limited partner, we report our allocable share of taxable income in computing our taxable income. To the extent held by a TRS, the TRS's tax expense or benefit is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the component of income or gains and losses to which such expense or benefit relates. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nIf we cease to qualify as a REIT, we, as a C corporation, would be obligated to pay federal and state income tax on our taxable income. For 2019, the federal income tax rate for a corporation was 21 percent.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The 2017 Tax Act also repealed the alternative minimum tax for corporations. We completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in 2018. We remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the updated rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which resulted in a $1.3 million transition adjustment that reduced net deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the impact of new tax legislation, as well as any future regulations and updates provided by the tax authorities. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 6 (\"Income Taxes\") for additional information.\nMAJOR TENANTS\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had two significant leases. For additional information concerning these leases, see Part I, Item 2, \"Properties\" and Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") included in this Report.

This section provides additional information concerning material developments related to our asset portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019 and through the date of this Report.\nGrand Isle Gathering System\nOn October 18, 2018, EGC was acquired by an affiliate of the privately-held Gulf of Mexico operator, Cox Oil, for approximately $322.0 million. With the purchase of EGC by Cox Oil, it is anticipated that EGC will remain a separate subsidiary owned by an affiliate of Cox Oil and that EGC (not Cox Oil) will continue to be the guarantor of the tenant's obligation under the Lease Agreement. To date, EGC has met its obligations to make lease payments. We are currently engaged in efforts to enforce the reporting requirements in the lease. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\").\nPinedale LGS\nEffective August 8, 2019, UPL's common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and commenced trading on the OTCQX marketplace under the symbol \"UPLC.\" UPL plans to continue to make all required SEC filings, including those on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and will remain subject to all SEC rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOn September 16, 2019, UPL announced that it entered into an amended credit facility to remove financial maintenance covenants among other provisional changes, while also announcing plans to suspend its drilling program by the end of September while natural gas pricing remains near multi-year lows. In connection with the approved credit facility amendment, UPL also announced a fall borrowing base redetermination of $1.175 billion, including $200 million of the commitment allocated to the credit facility. The amended credit facility also established maximum capital expenditures of $65 million, $10 million and $5 million, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and quarterly thereafter.\nOn November 7, 2019, UPL updated full-year 2019 capital investment guidance to a range of $240 million to $250 million. UPL also announced expected 2020 production to be between 182 and 192 Bcfe, which assumes suspended drilling and the maximum capital expenditures outlined above. UPL also stated it continues proactive efforts to reduce debt and affirms its ongoing advisor engagements that are focused on liability management and assisting management and its board of directors in evaluating a range of strategic alternatives.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 18, 2020, UPL announced a spring borrowing base redetermination, effective April 1, 2020, which will reduce the borrowing base to $1.075 billion, with $100 million of the commitment attributed to its credit facility. Additionally, UPL announced full-year 2019 production of 240.2 Bcfe.\nMoGas Pipeline\nEffective March 1, 2017, MoGas entered into a long-term firm transportation services agreement with Spire, its largest customer. The agreement extends the termination date for Spire's existing firm transportation agreement to October 31, 2030. During the entire extended term, Spire will continue to reserve 62,800 dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity on MoGas. This service continued at the full tariff rate of $12.385 per dekatherm per month until October 31, 2018, at which time the rate was reduced to $6.386 per dekatherm per month for the remainder of the agreement.\nOn May 31, 2018, MoGas filed a general rate case before FERC. The proposed change in rates sought to (i) recover increases in capital, operating and maintenance expenditures incurred; (ii) mitigate for the substantial decrease in volumes due to the loss of a firm transportation contract with a St. Louis natural gas marketing entity; (iii) mitigate for the substantial decrease in revenue from Spire; and (iv) reflect changes in the corporate income tax rate associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The proposed rates went into effect on December 1, 2018. On August 22, 2019, the FERC approved a settlement agreed to by MoGas and all intervenors in the rate case to provide annual rates of approximately $14.8 million, effective September 1, 2019. As a result of the approved and effective settlement, MoGas has begun to refund the difference between the filed rates and the settlement rates. In conjunction with the settlement, MoGas entered into 5-year firm transportation service agreements with its customers in exchange for modest discounts. The agreements, which amend prior year-to-year agreements, extend the termination date for the existing firm transportation service agreements to December 31, 2023.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Notional Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pinedale LP Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,944,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,528,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,416,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on Pinedale LP Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,107,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,607,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.00% Convertible Debt(1)\n</td> <td>2,092,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,092,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on 7.00% Convertible Debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% Convertible Debt\n</td> <td>120,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on 5.875% Convertible Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,108,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,909,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,123,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Subsequent to December 31, 2019, holders of the 7.00% Convertible Notes converted $416 thousand face amount of notes for 12,605 shares of common stock, reducing (i) the 7.00% Convertible Notes outstanding to $1.7 million and (ii) interest expense to $59 thousand in 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFees paid to Corridor under the Management Agreement and the Administrative Agreement are not included because they vary as a function of the value of our total asset base. For additional information see Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") included in this Report.\nSEASONALITY\nOur operating companies, MoGas and Omega, have stable revenues throughout the year and will complete necessary pipeline maintenance during the \"non-heating\" season, or quarters two and three. Therefore, operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have, and are not expected to have, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION\nDeflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction, and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or to refinance our properties and our tenants' ability to obtain credit. During inflationary\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nperiods, we intend for substantially all of our tenant leases to be designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. Often, our leases include rent escalators that are based on the CPI, or other agreed upon metrics that increase with inflation.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2019, we had liquidity of approximately $257.3 million comprised of cash of $120.9 million plus revolver availability of $136.4 million. During 2019, our liquidity was enhanced by the net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note offering, partially offset by cash utilized to complete two exchanges of the 7.00% Convertible Notes. The results of the MoGas rate case settlement discussed in the \"Asset Portfolio and Related Developments\" section above had a positive impact on revolver availability at the end of 2019 and going forward.\nWe use cash flows generated from our operations to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service payments and dividend payments. Management expects that future operating cash flows, along with access to financial markets, will be sufficient to fund future operating requirements and acquisition opportunities. If our ability to access the capital markets is restricted, as currently is the case as discussed in Part IV, Item 15, Note 13 (\"Stockholders' Equity\") or if debt or equity capital were unavailable on favorable terms, or at all, our ability to fund acquisition opportunities or to comply with the REIT distribution rules could be adversely affected.\nThere are acquisition opportunities that are in preliminary stages of review, and consummation of any of these opportunities may depend on a number of factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that any of these acquisition opportunities will result in consummated transactions. As part of our disciplined investment philosophy, we plan to use a moderate level of leverage, approximately 25 percent to 50 percent of assets, supplemented with accretive equity issuance as needed, subject to current market conditions.

The amended facility provides for commitments of up to $161.0 million, comprised of (i) increased commitments on the CorEnergy Revolver of up to $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base limitations, and (ii) a $1.0 million commitment on the MoGas Revolver.\nThe amended facility has a 5-year term maturing on July 28, 2022, and provided for a springing maturity on February 28, 2020, and thereafter, if we failed to meet certain liquidity requirements from the springing maturity date through the maturity of our 7.00% Convertible Notes on June 15, 2020. This springing maturity would have been triggered on the first date on or after February 28, 2020 that both (i) the outstanding principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes exceeded $28,750,000 and (ii) our unrestricted cash liquidity (including, for purposes of this calculation, the undrawn portion of the Borrowing Base then available for borrowing under the CorEnergy Credit Facility) was less than the sum of (x) the outstanding principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes plus (y) $5,000,000. We will not trigger the springing maturity as a result of the 7.00% Convertible Note exchange completed in August of 2019, which reduced the outstanding principal balance of the 7.00% Convertible Notes below the springing maturity threshold. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for further details on convertible debt transactions.\nUnder the terms of the amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility, we are subject to certain financial covenants as follows: (i) a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 2.0 to 1.0; (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0; (iii) a maximum senior secured recourse leverage ratio (which generally excludes debt from certain subsidiaries that are not obligors under the CorEnergy Credit Facility) of 3.0 to 1.0.; and (iv) a maximum total funded debt to capitalization ratio of 50 percent. In addition, there is a covenant related to our ability to make distributions that is tied to AFFO and applicable REIT distribution requirements, and provides that, in the absence of any acceleration of maturity following an Event of Default, we may make distributions equal to the greater of the amount required to maintain our REIT status and 100 percent of AFFO for the trailing 12-month period.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings under the credit facility will typically bear interest on the outstanding principal amount using a LIBOR pricing grid that is expected to equal a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 percent to 3.75 percent, based on our senior secured recourse leverage ratio. The facility contains, among other restrictions, certain default and cross-default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods), all of which are substantially the same as under the prior facility.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019 and had approximately $136.4 million of available borrowing capacity on the CorEnergy Revolver. For a summary of the additional material terms of the CorEnergy Credit Facility, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report.\nAmended Pinedale Term Credit Facility\nIn December 2012, Pinedale LP entered into a $70.0 million secured term credit facility with a lender that provided for monthly payments of principal and interest and was secured by the Pinedale LGS. The credit facility accrued interest at a variable annual rate linked to LIBOR.\nOn March 30, 2016, we and Prudential (collectively, \"the Refinancing Lenders\"), refinanced the remaining $58.5 million principal balance of the $70.0 million credit facility (on a pro rata basis equal to the respective equity interests in Pinedale LP, with our 81.05 percent share being approximately $47.4 million) and executed a series of agreements assigning the credit facility to the Refinancing Lenders, with CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. as Agent for the Refinancing Lenders. Our portion of the debt and interest was eliminated in consolidation and Prudential's portion of the debt was shown as a related-party liability.\nOn December 29, 2017, Pinedale LP entered into the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility, with Prudential and a group of lenders affiliated with Prudential as lenders and Prudential serving as administrative agent. The new amended facility is a 5-year $41.0 million term loan facility, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.5 percent, which matures on December 29, 2022. Principal payments of $294 thousand, plus accrued interest, are payable monthly. Proceeds from the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility were utilized by Pinedale LP to pay off the balance due to the Refinancing Lenders under the previously existing Pinedale LP credit facility. We utilized our portion of the proceeds from the repayment of the prior facility to finance the purchase of Prudential's 18.95 percent outstanding equity interest in Pinedale LP.\nThe Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility limits distributions by Pinedale LP to us, although such distributions are permitted to the extent required for us to maintain REIT qualification so long as Pinedale LP's obligations under the credit facility have not been accelerated following an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended Term Credit Facility).\nOutstanding balances under the facility are secured by the Pinedale LGS assets. The Amended Term Credit Facility is subject to (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0, (ii) a maximum leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.0 and (iii) a minimum net worth of $115.0 million, each measured at the Pinedale LP level and not at the Company level. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019. For a summary of the additional material terms of the Pinedale Credit Facility, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information.\nMoGas Revolver\nIn conjunction with the MoGas Transaction, MoGas Pipeline LLC and United Property Systems, LLC, as co-borrowers, entered into a revolving credit agreement dated November 24, 2014 (the \"MoGas Revolver\"), with certain lenders, including Regions Bank as agent for such lenders. Following subsequent amendments and restatements made on July 8, 2015 and July 28, 2017 in connection with the amendments and restatements of the CorEnergy Credit Facility, discussed above, commitments under the MoGas Revolver were reduced from the original level of $3.0 million to a current total of $1.0 million. Interest accrues under the MoGas Revolver at the same rate and pursuant to the same terms as it accrues under the CorEnergy Revolver. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") for further information. As of December 31, 2019, the co-borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no borrowings outstanding on the MoGas Revolver.\nMowood/Omega Revolver\nOn July 31, 2015, a $1.5 million revolving line of credit (\"Mowood/Omega Revolver\") was established with Regions Bank with a maturity date of July 31, 2016. Following annual extensions, the current maturity of the facility has been amended and extended to July 31, 2020. The Mowood/Omega Revolver is used by Omega for working capital and general business purposes and is guaranteed and secured by the assets of Omega. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus 4 percent and is payable monthly in arrears with no unused fee. There was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2019.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConvertible Notes\n7.00% Convertible Notes\nOn June 29, 2015, we completed a public offering of $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2020. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 7.0 percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015.\nAs authorized by our Board of Directors, during May 2016, we repurchased $1.0 million of face value of 7.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, certain holders elected to convert $42 thousand of 7.00% Convertible Notes for 1,271 shares of our common stock.\nOn January 16, 2019, we agreed with three holders of our 7.00% Convertible Notes, pursuant to privately negotiated agreements, to exchange $43.8 million face amount of such notes for an aggregate of 837,040 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, plus aggregate cash consideration of $19.8 million, including $315 thousand of interest expense. Our agent and lenders under the CorEnergy Credit Facility provided a consent for the convertible note exchange. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $5.0 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the first quarter of 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt included the write-off of a portion of the underwriter's discount and deferred debt costs of $409 thousand and $27 thousand, respectively.\nOn August 15, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the 5.875% Convertible Notes discussed further below, together with shares of our common stock, to exchange $63.9 million face amount of its 7.00% Convertible Notes pursuant to privately negotiated agreements with three holders. The total cash and stock consideration for the exchange was valued at approximately $93.2 million. This included an aggregate of 703,432 shares of common stock plus cash consideration of approximately $60.2 million, including $733 thousand of interest expense. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $28.9 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the third quarter of 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt included the write-off of a portion of the underwriter's discount and deferred debt costs of $360 thousand and $24 thousand, respectively. Collectively, for the two exchange transactions described above, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, certain holders elected to convert $4.2 million of 7.00% Convertible Notes for approximately 127,143 shares of common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has $2.1 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Notes outstanding.\nAt the present time, we may not redeem the remaining 7.00% Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date without the consent of the agent and lenders of the CorEnergy Credit Facility. Holders may convert their 7.00% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at their option until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The current conversion rate for the 7.00% Convertible Notes is 30.3030 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $33.00 per share of our common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events as specified in the Indenture.\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information concerning the 7.00% Convertible Notes.\n5.875% Convertible Notes\nOn August 12, 2019, we completed a private placement offering of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 to the initial purchasers of such notes for cash in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The initial purchasers then resold the 5.875% Convertible Notes for cash equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount thereof to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A. The 5.875% Convertible Notes mature on August 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 5.875 percent per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2020.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their 5.875% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The initial conversion rate for the 5.875% Convertible Notes is 20.0 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.875% Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $50.00 per share of our common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events as specified in the Indenture.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information concerning the 5.875% Convertible Notes.\nShelf Registration Statements\nOn October 30, 2018, we registered 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under our dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to a separate shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued 22,003 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to the shelf resulting in remaining availability (subject to the current limitation discussed below) of approximately 977,997 shares of common stock.\nOn November 9, 2018, we had a new shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC replacing our previously filed shelf registration statement, pursuant to which we may publicly offer additional debt or equity securities with an aggregate offering price of up to $600.0 million. As described elsewhere in this Report, EGC and Cox Oil have refused to provide the financial statement information concerning EGC that we must file pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X. At least until we are able to file these EGC financial statements, we do not expect to be able to use this shelf registration statement, or the shelf registration statement filed for our dividend reinvestment plan, to sell our securities.\nWe have engaged in dialogue with the staff of the SEC in an effort to shorten the period during which we do not use our registration statements. We do not expect this period to be shortened until the EGC financial statement information has been received and filed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such relief.\nLiquidity and Capitalization\nOur principal investing activities are acquiring and financing midstream and downstream real estate assets within the U.S. energy infrastructure sector and concurrently entering into long-term triple-net participating leases with energy companies. These investing activities have often been financed from the proceeds of our public equity and debt offerings as well as the term and credit facilities mentioned above. Continued growth of our asset portfolio will depend in part on our continued ability to access funds through additional borrowings and securities offerings. Additionally, our liquidity and capitalization may be impacted by the optional redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. As disclosed in Part IV, Item 15, Note 13 (\"Stockholders' Equity\"), the depositary shares may be redeemed on or after January 27, 2020, at our option, in whole or in part, at the $25.00 liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of redemption.\nThe following table presents our liquidity and capitalization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capitalization\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,863,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,287,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,358,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,721,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (including current maturities) (1)\n</td> <td>152,109,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,038,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockholders' equity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 7.375%, $0.001 par value\n</td> <td>125,493,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,555,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital stock, non-convertible, $0.001 par value\n</td> <td>13,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid-in capital\n</td> <td>360,844,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320,295,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings (deficit)\n</td> <td>(9,611,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,147,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CorEnergy equity\n</td> <td>476,739,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455,011,305\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CorEnergy capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628,848,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,049,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Long-term debt is presented net of discount and deferred debt costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also have two lines of credit for working capital purposes for two of our subsidiaries with maximum availability of $1.5 million and $1.0 million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor additional information regarding transactions that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2019, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 16 (\"Subsequent Events\") included in this annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe financial statements included in this Report are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSee Part IV, Item 15, Note 2 (\"Significant Accounting Policies\") included in this Report for further information related to our significant accounting policies.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of a subsea midstream pipeline system, liquids gathering system and natural gas pipelines that have been obtained through a business combination and asset acquisitions. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and improvements, which extend the useful lives of our assets, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment, and performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired. When a triggering event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we utilize cash flow projections to assess the ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from the evaluation of goodwill, for which the recoverability assessment utilizes fair value estimates that include discounted cash flows in the estimation process, and accordingly any goodwill impairment recognized may not be indicative of a similar impairment of the related underlying long-lived assets.\nThe projected cash flows of long-lived assets are primarily based on contractual cash flows relating to existing leases that extend many years into the future. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value that would be received if the asset were sold, discount rates, and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can differ from our estimates. There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe follow ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset. We recognized an existing ARO in conjunction with the acquisition of the GIGS in June 2015.\nWe measure changes in the ARO liability due to passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the amount of the liability at the beginning of the period. The increase in the carrying amount of the liability is recognized as an expense classified as an operating item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, hereinafter referred to as ARO accretion expense. We periodically reassess the timing and amount of cash flows anticipated associated with the ARO and adjusts the fair value of the liability accordingly under the guidance in ASC 410-20.\nThe fair value of the obligation at the acquisition date was capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and is being depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. The useful lives of most pipeline gathering systems are primarily derived from available supply resources and ultimate consumption of those resources by end users. Adjustments to the ARO resulting from reassessments of the timing and amount of cash flows will result in changes to the retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset.\nUpon decommissioning of the ARO or a portion thereof, we reduce the fair value of the liability and recognize a (gain) loss on settlement of ARO as an operating item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the difference between the liability and actual decommissioning costs incurred.\nFederal and State Income Taxation\nWe qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and intend to continue to remain so qualified. For further information, see \"Federal and State Income Taxation\" above in this Item 7 and \"Federal and State Income Taxation\" under\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Glossary of Defined Terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 5 \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" of this Report.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this Report.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and we can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information.\nBUSINESS OBJECTIVE\nCorEnergy primarily owns and seeks to own assets in the U.S. energy sector that perform utility-like functions, such as pipelines, storage terminals, rail terminals and gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. We also may provide other types of capital, including loans secured by energy infrastructure assets. Our objective has been to generate long-term contracted revenue from operators of our assets, primarily under triple-net participating leases without direct commodity price exposure. As a result of having received the PLR, we are now able to consider, and are considering, a broader set of investment opportunities than was available to us prior to issuance of the PLR. For additional information, see \"Company Overview\" in Item 1 of this Report.\nThe assets are primarily mission-critical, in that utilization of the assets is necessary for the business the operators of those assets seek to conduct and their rental payments are an essential operating expense. We acquire assets that will enhance the stability of our dividend through diversification, while offering the potential for long-term distribution growth. These sale-leaseback or real property mortgage transactions provide the energy company with a source of capital that is an alternative to sources such as corporate borrowing,\n\nbond offerings, or equity offerings. We believe our leadership team's energy and utility expertise provides CorEnergy with a competitive advantage to acquire, own and lease U.S. energy infrastructure assets in a tax-efficient, transparent and investor-friendly REIT.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc., as of December 31, 2019, and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the financial data and key operating statistics for CorEnergy for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We believe the Operating Results detail presented below provides investors with information that will assist them in analyzing our operating performance. The following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.\n\nThe following table and discussion are a summary of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenue. Consolidated revenues were $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $3.3 million. Lease revenue was $67.1 million and $72.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the decrease of approximately $5.7 million driven primarily by (i) the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility, partially offset by (ii) an increase in variable rent collected on the Pinedale lease during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransportation and distribution revenue from our subsidiaries MoGas and Omega was $18.8 million and $16.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $2.3 million increase primarily resulted from higher rates going into effect on December 1, 2018 related to the rate case filed by MoGas with the FERC, net of the final refund liability. The FERC rate case settlement was approved in August of 2019. Refer to \"Asset Portfolio and Related Developments\" for further discussion related to the FERC rate case settlement.\nTransportation and Distribution Expenses. Transportation and distribution expenses were $5.2 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $2.0 million. The decrease relates primarily to lower legal, consulting and maintenance costs at MoGas.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The most significant components of the variance from the prior year are outlined in the following table and explained below:\n\nManagement fees are directly proportional to our asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2019, management fees decreased $805 thousand compared to the prior year due to (i) cash utilized for the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchange in the first quarter of 2019, (ii) management fee waivers in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 to exclude the net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Notes offering (other than the cash portion of such proceeds utilized in connection with the exchange of the Company's 7.00% Convertible Notes) and (iii) lower incentive fees due to decreased revenue from the sale of the Portland Terminal in December 2018. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") for additional information.\nAcquisition and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.3 million from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in professional fees. Professional fees decreased $1.0 million during the current year while asset acquisition expenses decreased $336 thousand. Generally, we expect asset acquisition expenses to be repaid over time from income generated by acquisitions. However, any particular period may reflect significant expenses arising from third party legal, engineering, and consulting fees that are incurred in the early to mid-stages of due diligence. The decrease in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to higher legal and consulting costs in the prior year related to monitoring our GIGS asset and the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility, partially offset by legal and consulting costs incurred in the current year related to the ongoing litigation with EGC/Cox Oil. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") for additional information.\nOther expenses for the for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $295 thousand compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to a loss on settlement of ARO related to the decommissioning of a segment of the GIGS pipeline system during the prior year.\nDepreciation, Amortization and ARO Accretion Expense. Depreciation, amortization and ARO accretion expense was $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $2.4 million decrease was primarily driven by depreciation expense, which decreased approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in depreciation expense was driven by (i) the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility in December of 2018 and (ii) updates made to the estimated useful lives of certain ARO segments of GIGS at the end of 2018.\nProvision for loan gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for loan gain of approximately $37 thousand related to the satisfaction of the SWD loans with Four Wood Corridor upon sale of the assets securing the loans to Compass SWD, LLC in exchange for (i) a new loan agreement with Compass SWD, LLC for $1.3 million and (ii) cash proceeds from the sale recognized as principal payments on the SWD loans. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 5 (\"Financing Notes Receivable\"). There were no loan (gain) loss provisions recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Distributions and Other Income. Net distributions and other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.3 million compared to $107 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to interest income, which increased approximately $1.2 million from the prior-year period, due to a higher cash balance maintained during 2019. Net distributions of approximately $0.1 million recognized for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were impacted by (i) the sale of a large portion of the Lightfoot investment as a result of the Arc Logistics merger with Zenith, completed on December 21, 2017, (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018 and (iii) and the liquidation of Lightfoot at the end of 2019.\nThe portion of distributions and dividends deemed to be income versus a return of capital in any period are estimated at the time such distributions are received. These estimates may be subsequently revised based on information received from the portfolio company after their tax reporting periods are concluded. The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross cash distributions and dividend income received from our investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 to the net distributions and other income recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nNet Realized and Unrealized Loss on Other Equity Securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss on other equity securities of $1.8 million. The net loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to valuation considerations surrounding the arbitration award delivered to Eni USA and Gulf LNG as well as other market information. Due to the sale or asset disposition related to our investment securities at the end of 2018 and the liquidation of the remaining investment interest at the end of 2019, we no longer have an interest in other equity securities.\nInterest Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expense totaled approximately $10.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in interest expense as a result of the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchanges and conversions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by (ii) additional interest expense from the 5.875% Convertible Notes Offering in August of 2019. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\").\nGain on the sale of leased property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the sale of leased property totaling approximately $11.7 million was recorded in connection with the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility to Zenith Terminals on December 21, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\"). There was no gain on the sale of leased property recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $34.0 million was recorded in connection with the 7.00% Convertible Notes exchanges completed in the first and third quarters of 2019. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\"). There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense was $235 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The income tax expense recorded in the current year is primarily the result of (i) a change in our state effective rate due to changes in state law and state operations by certain of our TRS entities, (ii) certain fixed asset, deferred contract revenue and loan loss activities, partially offset by (iii) the impact of the refund liability related to the FERC rate case settlement and (iv) capital losses generated from the Lightfoot liquidation that will be carried back against capital gains from prior years. The income tax benefit recorded in the prior year was primarily attributable to (i) higher losses generated by our TRS subsidiaries and (ii) the capital losses generated from the sale of our interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest that were carried back against capital gains generated from the sale of a portion of the Lightfoot investment in prior years.\nNet Income. Net income was $4.1 million and $43.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $39.6 million. After deducting $9.3 million and $9.5 million for the portion of preferred dividends that are allocable to each respective period, net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $(5.2) million, or $(0.40) per basic and diluted common share, as compared to $34.2 million, or $2.86 per basic and $2.79 diluted common share, for the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. Consolidated revenues were $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $482 thousand. Lease revenue was $72.7 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with the increase of approximately $3.9 million driven primarily by variable rent collected on the Pinedale lease during 2018. Transportation and distribution revenue from our subsidiaries MoGas and Omega was $16.5 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $3.5 million decrease primarily resulted from a change to straight-line revenue recognition on MoGas' long-term contract with Spire under the new revenue recognition standard that was adopted on January 1, 2018. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.2 million lower under the new accounting standard. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 4 (\"Transportation And Distribution Revenue\") for additional details.\n\nTransportation and Distribution Expenses. Transportation and distribution expenses were $7.2 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $481 thousand. The increase relates primarily to MoGas, which had higher legal and consulting costs during 2018 related to the FERC rate case. The increase was partially offset by lower costs from the timing of projects performed by Omega for Fort Leonard Wood.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The most significant components of the variance from the prior year are outlined in the following table and explained below: \nManagement fees are directly proportional to our asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2018, management fees increased $378 thousand compared to the prior year due to the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Pinedale LP, which closed on December 29, 2017. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") for additional information.\nAcquisition and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.4 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in professional fees. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to (i) higher legal and consulting costs in the current-year related to monitoring our GIGS asset, (ii) higher legal and consulting fees related to the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility and (iii) a prior-year reimbursement of legal fees received in 2017 for costs incurred during UPL's bankruptcy.\nAsset acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were relatively consistent with the prior year, decreasing $71 thousand, due to continued focus on potential acquisition opportunities. Generally, we expect asset acquisition expenses to be repaid over time from income generated by acquisitions. However, any particular period may reflect significant expenses arising from third party legal, engineering, and consulting fees that are incurred in the early to mid-stages of due diligence.\nOther expenses for the for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $500 thousand compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily related to (i) a loss on settlement of ARO related to the decommissioning of a segment of the GIGS pipeline system during 2018 and (ii) a non-cash gain recorded on settlement of accounts payable in the prior year.\nDepreciation, Amortization and ARO Accretion Expense. Depreciation, amortization and ARO accretion expense was $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $900 thousand increase was primarily driven by an increase in ARO depreciation based on updates made to the estimated useful lives of certain segments of GIGS at the end of 2017.\nProvision for loan gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for loan gain of approximately $37 thousand related to the satisfaction of the SWD loans with Four Wood Corridor upon sale of the assets securing the loans to Compass SWD, LLC in exchange for (i) a new loan agreement with Compass SWD, LLC for $1.3 million and (ii) cash proceeds from the sale recognized as principal payments on the SWD loans. There were no loan (gain) loss provisions recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Distributions and Other Income. Net distributions and other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $107 thousand compared to $680 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The portion of distributions and dividends deemed to be income versus a return of capital in any period are estimated at the time such distributions are received. These estimates may be subsequently revised based on information received from the portfolio company after their tax reporting periods are concluded. The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross cash distributions and dividend income received from our investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to the net distributions and other income recorded as income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, the decline in net distributions and dividends recorded as income versus the prior-year period was primarily due to (i) the sale of a large portion of the Lightfoot investment as a result of the Arc Logistics merger with Zenith, completed on December 21, 2017 and (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Other Equity Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a net loss on other equity securities of $1.8 million and a net gain on other equity securities of $1.5 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $3.4 million. The net gain and loss recorded are directly related to fluctuations in the valuation, sale and liquidation plan of our investments in private securities. The net loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to (i) the sale of our equity interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and (ii) Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest at the end of 2018. The net gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to gains realized related to Lightfoot upon completion of the Arc Logistics merger and valuation of the remaining investment in the Lightfoot LP and GP interests. See Part IV, Item 15, Note 10 (\"Fair Value\") for additional information.\nInterest Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest expense totaled approximately $12.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. This increase was attributable to (i) increased interest on the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility during 2018 as a result of the refinancing with Prudential on December 29, 2017, partially offset by (ii) interest incurred on outstanding borrowings on the CorEnergy Revolver and CorEnergy Term Loan during the prior year.\nGain on the sale of leased property. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the sale of leased property totaling approximately $11.7 million was recorded in connection with the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility to Zenith Terminals on December 21, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\"). There was no gain on the sale of leased property recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $337 thousand was recorded in connection with entering into the amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility on July 28, 2017 and Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility on December 29, 2017. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\").\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increased benefit in 2018 was primarily attributable to (i) higher losses generated by our TRS subsidiaries and (ii) the capital losses generated from the sale of our interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals and Lightfoot's disposition of its remaining asset interest that will be carried back against capital gains generated from the sale of a portion of the Lightfoot investment in the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to (i) the transition tax adjustment associated with application of lower effective tax rates from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 to existing deferred tax asset balances at our TRS entities, (ii) the write-off of certain deferred tax assets in connection with the reorganization of Omega from a TRS subsidiary to a qualified REIT subsidiary and (iii) realized and unrealized gains recorded associated with our Lightfoot investment.\nNet Income. Net income was $43.7 million and $34.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $9.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net income attributable to CorEnergy stockholders was $43.7 million and $32.6 million, respectively. After deducting $9.5 million and $8.0 million for the portion of preferred dividends that are allocable to each respective period, net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.2 million, or $2.86 per basic and $2.79 diluted common share, as compared to $24.6 million, or $2.07 per basic and diluted common share, for the prior year.\n\nCommon Equity Attributable to CorEnergy Stockholders per Share\nAs of December 31, 2019, our common equity increased by approximately $21.8 million to $351.2 million from $329.5 million as of December 31, 2018. This increase principally consists of: (i) $66.1 million of common stock issued pursuant to exchanges and conversion of 7.00% Convertible Notes and (ii) $404 thousand of common stock issued pursuant to reinvestment of dividends through the dividend reinvestment plan; partially offset by (iii) net loss attributable to CorEnergy common stockholders of approximately $5.2 million and (iv) dividends paid to our stockholders of approximately $39.5 million.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use certain financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Report include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"EBITDAre\"); EBITDAre as adjusted in the manner described below (\"Adjusted EBITDAre\"); NAREIT funds from operations (\"NAREIT FFO\"); funds from operations adjusted for securities investments (\"FFO\"); and FFO as further adjusted in the manner described below (\"AFFO\"). These supplemental measures are used by our management team and are presented because we believe they help investors understand our business, performance and ability to earn and distribute cash to our stockholders by providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income. The presentation of EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO, FFO and AFFO are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe offer these measures to assist the users of our financial statements in assessing our operating performance under U.S. GAAP, but these measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered measures of liquidity, alternatives to net income or indicators of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including capital expenditures (if any), to make payments on our indebtedness or to make distributions. Our method of calculating these measures may be different from methods used by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income, cash flows from operating activities or revenues.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors and lenders may use to evaluate our ongoing operating results, including (i) the performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets and (ii) the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. EBITDAre, as established by NAREIT, is defined as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre represents EBITDAre adjusted for net realized and unrealized (gain) loss on securities, non-cash; (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; provision for loan (gain) loss; preferred dividend requirements; distributions and dividends received in prior period previously deemed a return of capital (recorded as a cost reduction) and reclassified as income in a subsequent period; (gain) loss on settlement of ARO; and non-cash settlement of accounts payable.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our presentation of EBITDAre is calculated in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of\n\nEBITDAre. In addition, although EBITDAre is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing to non-REITs. Adjusted EBITDAre presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered measures of liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, net income or other indicators of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre:\n\nNAREIT FFO\nFFO is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. As defined by NAREIT, NAREIT FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses of depreciable properties, real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs or loan origination costs) and other adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and non-controlling interests. Adjustments for non-controlling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO attributable to common stockholders as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock. Our method of calculating FFO attributable to common stockholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, as such, may not be comparable.\nFFO ADJUSTED FOR SECURITIES INVESTMENTS (FFO)\nDue to the legacy investments that we held, we have also historically presented a measure of FFO, to which we refer herein as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments which is derived by further adjusting NAREIT FFO for distributions received from investment securities, income tax expense (benefit) from investment securities, net distributions and other income and net realized and unrealized gain or loss on other equity securities.\nWe present NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in\n\nthe evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is a key measure we use in assessing performance and in making resource allocation decisions.\nBoth NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions, and that may also be the case with certain of the energy infrastructure assets in which we invest. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments exclude depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items. As such, these performance measures provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income when compared to prior-year periods. These metrics reflect the impact to operations from trends in base and participating rents, company operating costs, development activities, and interest costs.\nWe calculate NAREIT FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002) and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment as NAREIT FFO with additional adjustments described above due to our legacy investments. This may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly may not be comparable to such other REITs. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital for replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties. NAREIT FFO and FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments, as we have historically reported, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our liquidity, or as an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or to service our indebtedness.\nAFFO\nManagement uses AFFO as a measure of long-term sustainable operational performance. AFFO in excess of dividends is used for debt repayment, capital reinvestment activities, funding our ARO liability, or other commitments and uncertainties which are necessary to sustain our dividend over the long term. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our liquidity, or as an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or service our indebtedness.\nFor completeness, the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and our calculations of NAREIT FFO, FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments, and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. AFFO is a supplemental, non-GAAP financial measure which we define as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment plus (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for loan (gain) loss, net of tax, transaction costs, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of deferred lease costs, accretion of asset retirement obligation, amortization of above market leases, income tax expense (benefit) unrelated to securities investments, non-cash costs associated with derivative instruments, (gain) loss on the settlement of ARO, and certain costs of a nonrecurring nature, less maintenance, capital expenditures (if any), amortization of debt premium, and other adjustments as deemed appropriate by Management. Also presented is information regarding the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding used for the computation of per share data:\n\n\n\n\n\nDIVIDENDS\nOur portfolio of real property assets and promissory notes generates cash flow from which we pay distributions to stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of our stockholder distributions include lease revenue and transportation and distribution revenue from our real property assets. Deterioration in the cash flows generated by any of these sources may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders. Based on our current asset base, we target a ratio of AFFO to dividends of 1.5 times. We believe that this level of coverage provides a prudent reserve level to achieve dividend stability and growth over the long term. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our ratio of AFFO to dividends is 1.35 times, which is below our target ratio.\nTo maintain AFFO coverage in 2020, we believe that a number of actions can be taken to adequately offset the lost revenue from the sale of the Portland Terminal, which include deleveraging of our balance sheet through preferred equity and debt repurchases, at attractive market prices. However, in the current market, we believe it is prudent to hold the net cash proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note Offering to utilize in additional investments in revenue generating assets. We regularly assess our ability to pay and to grow our dividend to common stockholders, and there is no assurance that we will continue to make regular dividend payments at current levels.\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and distributions to preferred stockholders are recorded when declared by the Board of Directors. The characterization of any distribution for federal income tax purposes will not be determined until after the end of the taxable year. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 6 (\"Income Taxes\") included in this Report for information on characterization of distributions for federal income tax purposes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nA REIT is generally required to distribute during the taxable year an amount equal to at least 90 percent of the REIT taxable income (determined under Internal Revenue Code section 857(b)(2), without regard to the deduction for dividends paid). We intend to adhere to this requirement in order to maintain our REIT status. The Board of Directors will continue to determine the amount of any distribution that we expect to pay our stockholders. Dividend payouts may be affected by cash flow requirements and remain subject to other risks and uncertainties.\nThe following table sets forth common stock distributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Distributions are shown in the period in which they were declared.\n\n\nThe following table sets forth preferred stock distributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nOn February 28, 2020, we will pay fourth quarter dividends of $0.75 per share of common stock and $0.4609375 per depositary share for our 7.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nFEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXATION\nIn 2013 we qualified, and in March 2014 elected (effective as of January 1, 2013), to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes (which we refer to as the \"REIT Election\"). Because certain of our assets may not produce REIT-qualifying income or be treated as interests in real property, those assets are held in wholly-owned TRSs in order to limit the potential that such assets and income could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for 2013 and subsequent years and generally will not pay federal income tax on taxable income of the REIT that is distributed to our stockholders. As a REIT, our distributions from earnings and profits will be treated as ordinary income and a return of capital, and generally will not qualify as qualified dividend income (\"QDI\"). To the extent that the REIT had accumulated C corporation earnings and profits from the periods prior to 2013, we distributed such earnings and profits in 2013. In addition, to the extent we receive taxable distributions from our TRSs, or the REIT received distributions of C corporation earnings and profits, such portion of our distribution is generally treated as QDI. While regular REIT dividends are not eligible for the reduced QDI tax rates, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, Section 199A of the Code typically permits a 20 percent deduction against taxable income for noncorporate taxpayers for qualified business income, which includes dividends from a REIT received during the tax year that is not a capital gain dividend or a dividend qualifying for the QDI rate, subject to certain income and holding period limitations.\nAs a REIT, we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more wholly-owned TRSs. Our use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. As was done with our subsidiary Omega in 2017, and as warranted in the future, we may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to our C corporation or other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.\nOur other equity securities are limited partnerships or limited liability companies which are treated as partnerships for federal and state income tax purposes. As a limited partner, we report our allocable share of taxable income in computing our taxable income. To the extent held by a TRS, the TRS's tax expense or benefit is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the component of income or gains and losses to which such expense or benefit relates. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nIf we cease to qualify as a REIT, we, as a C corporation, would be obligated to pay federal and state income tax on our taxable income. For 2019, the federal income tax rate for a corporation was 21 percent.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The 2017 Tax Act also repealed the alternative minimum tax for corporations. We completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in 2018. We remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the updated rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which resulted in a $1.3 million transition adjustment that reduced net deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the impact of new tax legislation, as well as any future regulations and updates provided by the tax authorities. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 6 (\"Income Taxes\") for additional information.\nMAJOR TENANTS\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had two significant leases. For additional information concerning these leases, see Part I, Item 2, \"Properties\" and Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") included in this Report. The table below displays the impact of significant leases on total leased properties and total lease revenues for the periods presented.\n\nASSET PORTFOLIO AND RELATED DEVELOPMENTS\nDescriptions of our asset portfolio and related operations, are included in Part I, Item 2, \"Properties\" and in Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\") and Note 5 (\"Financing Notes Receivable\") included in this Report. This section provides additional information concerning material developments related to our asset portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019 and through the date of this Report.\nGrand Isle Gathering System\nOn October 18, 2018, EGC was acquired by an affiliate of the privately-held Gulf of Mexico operator, Cox Oil, for approximately $322.0 million. With the purchase of EGC by Cox Oil, it is anticipated that EGC will remain a separate subsidiary owned by an affiliate of Cox Oil and that EGC (not Cox Oil) will continue to be the guarantor of the tenant's obligation under the Lease Agreement. To date, EGC has met its obligations to make lease payments. We are currently engaged in efforts to enforce the reporting requirements in the lease. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 (\"Leased Properties And Leases\").\nPinedale LGS\nEffective August 8, 2019, UPL's common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and commenced trading on the OTCQX marketplace under the symbol \"UPLC.\" UPL plans to continue to make all required SEC filings, including those on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and will remain subject to all SEC rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOn September 16, 2019, UPL announced that it entered into an amended credit facility to remove financial maintenance covenants among other provisional changes, while also announcing plans to suspend its drilling program by the end of September while natural gas pricing remains near multi-year lows. In connection with the approved credit facility amendment, UPL also announced a fall borrowing base redetermination of $1.175 billion, including $200 million of the commitment allocated to the credit facility. The amended credit facility also established maximum capital expenditures of $65 million, $10 million and $5 million, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and quarterly thereafter.\nOn November 7, 2019, UPL updated full-year 2019 capital investment guidance to a range of $240 million to $250 million. UPL also announced expected 2020 production to be between 182 and 192 Bcfe, which assumes suspended drilling and the maximum capital expenditures outlined above. UPL also stated it continues proactive efforts to reduce debt and affirms its ongoing advisor engagements that are focused on liability management and assisting management and its board of directors in evaluating a range of strategic alternatives.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, UPL announced a spring borrowing base redetermination, effective April 1, 2020, which will reduce the borrowing base to $1.075 billion, with $100 million of the commitment attributed to its credit facility. Additionally, UPL announced full-year 2019 production of 240.2 Bcfe.\nMoGas Pipeline\nEffective March 1, 2017, MoGas entered into a long-term firm transportation services agreement with Spire, its largest customer. The agreement extends the termination date for Spire's existing firm transportation agreement to October 31, 2030. During the entire extended term, Spire will continue to reserve 62,800 dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity on MoGas. This service continued at the full tariff rate of $12.385 per dekatherm per month until October 31, 2018, at which time the rate was reduced to $6.386 per dekatherm per month for the remainder of the agreement.\nOn May 31, 2018, MoGas filed a general rate case before FERC. The proposed change in rates sought to (i) recover increases in capital, operating and maintenance expenditures incurred; (ii) mitigate for the substantial decrease in volumes due to the loss of a firm transportation contract with a St. Louis natural gas marketing entity; (iii) mitigate for the substantial decrease in revenue from Spire; and (iv) reflect changes in the corporate income tax rate associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The proposed rates went into effect on December 1, 2018. On August 22, 2019, the FERC approved a settlement agreed to by MoGas and all intervenors in the rate case to provide annual rates of approximately $14.8 million, effective September 1, 2019. As a result of the approved and effective settlement, MoGas has begun to refund the difference between the filed rates and the settlement rates. In conjunction with the settlement, MoGas entered into 5-year firm transportation service agreements with its customers in exchange for modest discounts. The agreements, which amend prior year-to-year agreements, extend the termination date for the existing firm transportation service agreements to December 31, 2023.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2019:\n\nFees paid to Corridor under the Management Agreement and the Administrative Agreement are not included because they vary as a function of the value of our total asset base. For additional information see Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 (\"Management Agreement\") included in this Report.\nSEASONALITY\nOur operating companies, MoGas and Omega, have stable revenues throughout the year and will complete necessary pipeline maintenance during the \"non-heating\" season, or quarters two and three. Therefore, operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have, and are not expected to have, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION\nDeflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction, and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or to refinance our properties and our tenants' ability to obtain credit. During inflationary\n\nperiods, we intend for substantially all of our tenant leases to be designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. Often, our leases include rent escalators that are based on the CPI, or other agreed upon metrics that increase with inflation.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2019, we had liquidity of approximately $257.3 million comprised of cash of $120.9 million plus revolver availability of $136.4 million. During 2019, our liquidity was enhanced by the net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note offering, partially offset by cash utilized to complete two exchanges of the 7.00% Convertible Notes. The results of the MoGas rate case settlement discussed in the \"Asset Portfolio and Related Developments\" section above had a positive impact on revolver availability at the end of 2019 and going forward.\nWe use cash flows generated from our operations to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service payments and dividend payments. Management expects that future operating cash flows, along with access to financial markets, will be sufficient to fund future operating requirements and acquisition opportunities. If our ability to access the capital markets is restricted, as currently is the case as discussed in Part IV, Item 15, Note 13 (\"Stockholders' Equity\") or if debt or equity capital were unavailable on favorable terms, or at all, our ability to fund acquisition opportunities or to comply with the REIT distribution rules could be adversely affected.\nThere are acquisition opportunities that are in preliminary stages of review, and consummation of any of these opportunities may depend on a number of factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that any of these acquisition opportunities will result in consummated transactions. As part of our disciplined investment philosophy, we plan to use a moderate level of leverage, approximately 25 percent to 50 percent of assets, supplemented with accretive equity issuance as needed, subject to current market conditions. We may invest in assets subject to greater leverage which could be both recourse and non-recourse to us.\nCash Flows - Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nThe following table presents our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated below:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily generated by (i) lease receipts of $63.2 million ($67.1 million lease revenue, net of $3.9 million of straight-line rent accrued during the period) and (ii) $17.1 million in net contributions from our operating subsidiaries MoGas and Omega, partially offset by (iii) $10.6 million in general and administrative expenses and (iv) $6.8 million in cash paid for interest.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily generated by (i) lease receipts of $62.3 million ($72.7 million lease revenue, net of $7.0 million of straight-line rent accrued during the period and $3.4 million of unearned revenue received in 2017) and (ii) $12.5 million in net contributions from our operating subsidiaries MoGas and Omega, partially offset by (iii) $13.0 million in general and administrative expenses, (iv) $11.2 million in cash paid for interest and (v) a $1.3 million increase in accounts and other receivables during the period.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily generated by (i) lease receipts of $61.6 million ($68.8 million lease revenue, net of $7.2 million of straight-line rent accrued during the period), (ii) $13.2 million in net contributions from our operating subsidiaries MoGas and Omega, (iii) an additional $2.9 million in unearned lease receipts associated with January 2018 revenues received in 2017 and (iv) $853 thousand in distributions and dividends received, partially offset by (v) $10.8 million in general and administrative expenses and (vi) $10.8 million in cash paid for interest.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily attributed to a $5.0 million payment received on January 7, 2019 related to the promissory note entered into as part of the Portland Terminal Facility sale.\n\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributed to (i) the proceeds from the sale of the Portland Terminal Facility and equity interest in Joliet to Zenith Terminals, which generated proceeds of approximately $56.0 million, (ii) return of capital distributions on our Lightfoot investment of $664 thousand and (iii) principal payments associated with the Four Wood financing note receivable of $237 thousand.\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributed to $7.6 million in proceeds received from the sale of the majority of our equity securities. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 10 (\"Fair Value\") for additional details.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily attributable to (i) cash paid for the extinguishment of the 7.00% Convertible Notes of $78.9 million, (ii) common and preferred dividends paid of $39.1 million and $9.3 million, respectively and (iii) principal payments of $3.5 million on our secured credit facilities, partially offset by (iv) net proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Notes offering of $116.4 million.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to (i) common and preferred dividends paid of $34.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively, (ii) cash used to repurchase Series A Preferred Stock of $4.3 million, (iii) principal payments of $3.5 million on our secured credit facilities and (iv) $264 thousand of payments related to debt financing costs.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to (i) net payments on the CorEnergy Revolver of $44.0 million, (ii) principal payments of $45.6 million on our secured credit facilities, (iii) common and preferred dividends paid of $34.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, (iv) purchase of the non-controlling interest in Pinedale LP for $32.8 million, (v) payment of $1.5 million for debt issuance costs related to the CorEnergy Credit Facility and Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility refinancings and (vi) distributions of $1.8 million to our non-controlling interest, partially offset by (vii) net offering proceeds on Series A Preferred Stock of $71.2 million and (viii) $41.0 million in proceeds from the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility.\nRevolving and Term Credit Facilities\nCorEnergy Credit Facility\nPrior to 2017, we had a credit facility with Regions Bank (as lender and administrative agent for the other participating lenders) providing borrowing capacity of $153.0 million, consisting of (i) the CorEnergy Revolver of $105.0 million, (ii) the CorEnergy Term Loan of $45.0 million and (iii) the MoGas Revolver of $3.0 million.\nOn July 28, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility with Regions Bank (as lender and administrative agent for other participating lenders). The amended facility provides for commitments of up to $161.0 million, comprised of (i) increased commitments on the CorEnergy Revolver of up to $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base limitations, and (ii) a $1.0 million commitment on the MoGas Revolver.\nThe amended facility has a 5-year term maturing on July 28, 2022, and provided for a springing maturity on February 28, 2020, and thereafter, if we failed to meet certain liquidity requirements from the springing maturity date through the maturity of our 7.00% Convertible Notes on June 15, 2020. This springing maturity would have been triggered on the first date on or after February 28, 2020 that both (i) the outstanding principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes exceeded $28,750,000 and (ii) our unrestricted cash liquidity (including, for purposes of this calculation, the undrawn portion of the Borrowing Base then available for borrowing under the CorEnergy Credit Facility) was less than the sum of (x) the outstanding principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes plus (y) $5,000,000. We will not trigger the springing maturity as a result of the 7.00% Convertible Note exchange completed in August of 2019, which reduced the outstanding principal balance of the 7.00% Convertible Notes below the springing maturity threshold. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for further details on convertible debt transactions.\nUnder the terms of the amended and restated CorEnergy Credit Facility, we are subject to certain financial covenants as follows: (i) a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 2.0 to 1.0; (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0; (iii) a maximum senior secured recourse leverage ratio (which generally excludes debt from certain subsidiaries that are not obligors under the CorEnergy Credit Facility) of 3.0 to 1.0.; and (iv) a maximum total funded debt to capitalization ratio of 50 percent. In addition, there is a covenant related to our ability to make distributions that is tied to AFFO and applicable REIT distribution requirements, and provides that, in the absence of any acceleration of maturity following an Event of Default, we may make distributions equal to the greater of the amount required to maintain our REIT status and 100 percent of AFFO for the trailing 12-month period.\n\nBorrowings under the credit facility will typically bear interest on the outstanding principal amount using a LIBOR pricing grid that is expected to equal a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 percent to 3.75 percent, based on our senior secured recourse leverage ratio. The facility contains, among other restrictions, certain default and cross-default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods), all of which are substantially the same as under the prior facility.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019 and had approximately $136.4 million of available borrowing capacity on the CorEnergy Revolver. For a summary of the additional material terms of the CorEnergy Credit Facility, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report.\nAmended Pinedale Term Credit Facility\nIn December 2012, Pinedale LP entered into a $70.0 million secured term credit facility with a lender that provided for monthly payments of principal and interest and was secured by the Pinedale LGS. The credit facility accrued interest at a variable annual rate linked to LIBOR.\nOn March 30, 2016, we and Prudential (collectively, \"the Refinancing Lenders\"), refinanced the remaining $58.5 million principal balance of the $70.0 million credit facility (on a pro rata basis equal to the respective equity interests in Pinedale LP, with our 81.05 percent share being approximately $47.4 million) and executed a series of agreements assigning the credit facility to the Refinancing Lenders, with CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. as Agent for the Refinancing Lenders. Our portion of the debt and interest was eliminated in consolidation and Prudential's portion of the debt was shown as a related-party liability.\nOn December 29, 2017, Pinedale LP entered into the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility, with Prudential and a group of lenders affiliated with Prudential as lenders and Prudential serving as administrative agent. The new amended facility is a 5-year $41.0 million term loan facility, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.5 percent, which matures on December 29, 2022. Principal payments of $294 thousand, plus accrued interest, are payable monthly. Proceeds from the Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility were utilized by Pinedale LP to pay off the balance due to the Refinancing Lenders under the previously existing Pinedale LP credit facility. We utilized our portion of the proceeds from the repayment of the prior facility to finance the purchase of Prudential's 18.95 percent outstanding equity interest in Pinedale LP.\nThe Amended Pinedale Term Credit Facility limits distributions by Pinedale LP to us, although such distributions are permitted to the extent required for us to maintain REIT qualification so long as Pinedale LP's obligations under the credit facility have not been accelerated following an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended Term Credit Facility).\nOutstanding balances under the facility are secured by the Pinedale LGS assets. The Amended Term Credit Facility is subject to (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0, (ii) a maximum leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.0 and (iii) a minimum net worth of $115.0 million, each measured at the Pinedale LP level and not at the Company level. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019. For a summary of the additional material terms of the Pinedale Credit Facility, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information.\nMoGas Revolver\nIn conjunction with the MoGas Transaction, MoGas Pipeline LLC and United Property Systems, LLC, as co-borrowers, entered into a revolving credit agreement dated November 24, 2014 (the \"MoGas Revolver\"), with certain lenders, including Regions Bank as agent for such lenders. Following subsequent amendments and restatements made on July 8, 2015 and July 28, 2017 in connection with the amendments and restatements of the CorEnergy Credit Facility, discussed above, commitments under the MoGas Revolver were reduced from the original level of $3.0 million to a current total of $1.0 million. Interest accrues under the MoGas Revolver at the same rate and pursuant to the same terms as it accrues under the CorEnergy Revolver. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") for further information. As of December 31, 2019, the co-borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no borrowings outstanding on the MoGas Revolver.\nMowood/Omega Revolver\nOn July 31, 2015, a $1.5 million revolving line of credit (\"Mowood/Omega Revolver\") was established with Regions Bank with a maturity date of July 31, 2016. Following annual extensions, the current maturity of the facility has been amended and extended to July 31, 2020. The Mowood/Omega Revolver is used by Omega for working capital and general business purposes and is guaranteed and secured by the assets of Omega. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus 4 percent and is payable monthly in arrears with no unused fee. There was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2019.\n\nConvertible Notes\n7.00% Convertible Notes\nOn June 29, 2015, we completed a public offering of $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2020. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 7.0 percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015.\nAs authorized by our Board of Directors, during May 2016, we repurchased $1.0 million of face value of 7.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, certain holders elected to convert $42 thousand of 7.00% Convertible Notes for 1,271 shares of our common stock.\nOn January 16, 2019, we agreed with three holders of our 7.00% Convertible Notes, pursuant to privately negotiated agreements, to exchange $43.8 million face amount of such notes for an aggregate of 837,040 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, plus aggregate cash consideration of $19.8 million, including $315 thousand of interest expense. Our agent and lenders under the CorEnergy Credit Facility provided a consent for the convertible note exchange. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $5.0 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the first quarter of 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt included the write-off of a portion of the underwriter's discount and deferred debt costs of $409 thousand and $27 thousand, respectively.\nOn August 15, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the 5.875% Convertible Notes discussed further below, together with shares of our common stock, to exchange $63.9 million face amount of its 7.00% Convertible Notes pursuant to privately negotiated agreements with three holders. The total cash and stock consideration for the exchange was valued at approximately $93.2 million. This included an aggregate of 703,432 shares of common stock plus cash consideration of approximately $60.2 million, including $733 thousand of interest expense. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $28.9 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the third quarter of 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt included the write-off of a portion of the underwriter's discount and deferred debt costs of $360 thousand and $24 thousand, respectively. Collectively, for the two exchange transactions described above, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, certain holders elected to convert $4.2 million of 7.00% Convertible Notes for approximately 127,143 shares of common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has $2.1 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Notes outstanding.\nAt the present time, we may not redeem the remaining 7.00% Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date without the consent of the agent and lenders of the CorEnergy Credit Facility. Holders may convert their 7.00% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at their option until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The current conversion rate for the 7.00% Convertible Notes is 30.3030 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 7.00% Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $33.00 per share of our common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events as specified in the Indenture.\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information concerning the 7.00% Convertible Notes.\n5.875% Convertible Notes\nOn August 12, 2019, we completed a private placement offering of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 to the initial purchasers of such notes for cash in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The initial purchasers then resold the 5.875% Convertible Notes for cash equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount thereof to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A. The 5.875% Convertible Notes mature on August 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 5.875 percent per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2020.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their 5.875% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The initial conversion rate for the 5.875% Convertible Notes is 20.0 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.875% Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $50.00 per share of our common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events as specified in the Indenture.\n\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 11 (\"Debt\") included in this Report for additional information concerning the 5.875% Convertible Notes.\nShelf Registration Statements\nOn October 30, 2018, we registered 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under our dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to a separate shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued 22,003 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to the shelf resulting in remaining availability (subject to the current limitation discussed below) of approximately 977,997 shares of common stock.\nOn November 9, 2018, we had a new shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC replacing our previously filed shelf registration statement, pursuant to which we may publicly offer additional debt or equity securities with an aggregate offering price of up to $600.0 million. As described elsewhere in this Report, EGC and Cox Oil have refused to provide the financial statement information concerning EGC that we must file pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X. At least until we are able to file these EGC financial statements, we do not expect to be able to use this shelf registration statement, or the shelf registration statement filed for our dividend reinvestment plan, to sell our securities.\nWe have engaged in dialogue with the staff of the SEC in an effort to shorten the period during which we do not use our registration statements. We do not expect this period to be shortened until the EGC financial statement information has been received and filed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such relief.\nLiquidity and Capitalization\nOur principal investing activities are acquiring and financing midstream and downstream real estate assets within the U.S. energy infrastructure sector and concurrently entering into long-term triple-net participating leases with energy companies. These investing activities have often been financed from the proceeds of our public equity and debt offerings as well as the term and credit facilities mentioned above. Continued growth of our asset portfolio will depend in part on our continued ability to access funds through additional borrowings and securities offerings. Additionally, our liquidity and capitalization may be impacted by the optional redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. As disclosed in Part IV, Item 15, Note 13 (\"Stockholders' Equity\"), the depositary shares may be redeemed on or after January 27, 2020, at our option, in whole or in part, at the $25.00 liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of redemption.\nThe following table presents our liquidity and capitalization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nWe also have two lines of credit for working capital purposes for two of our subsidiaries with maximum availability of $1.5 million and $1.0 million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor additional information regarding transactions that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2019, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 16 (\"Subsequent Events\") included in this annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe financial statements included in this Report are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSee Part IV, Item 15, Note 2 (\"Significant Accounting Policies\") included in this Report for further information related to our significant accounting policies.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of a subsea midstream pipeline system, liquids gathering system and natural gas pipelines that have been obtained through a business combination and asset acquisitions. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and improvements, which extend the useful lives of our assets, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment, and performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired. When a triggering event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we utilize cash flow projections to assess the ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from the evaluation of goodwill, for which the recoverability assessment utilizes fair value estimates that include discounted cash flows in the estimation process, and accordingly any goodwill impairment recognized may not be indicative of a similar impairment of the related underlying long-lived assets.\nThe projected cash flows of long-lived assets are primarily based on contractual cash flows relating to existing leases that extend many years into the future. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value that would be received if the asset were sold, discount rates, and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can differ from our estimates. There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe follow ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset. We recognized an existing ARO in conjunction with the acquisition of the GIGS in June 2015.\nWe measure changes in the ARO liability due to passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the amount of the liability at the beginning of the period. The increase in the carrying amount of the liability is recognized as an expense classified as an operating item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, hereinafter referred to as ARO accretion expense. We periodically reassess the timing and amount of cash flows anticipated associated with the ARO and adjusts the fair value of the liability accordingly under the guidance in ASC 410-20.\nThe fair value of the obligation at the acquisition date was capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and is being depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. The useful lives of most pipeline gathering systems are primarily derived from available supply resources and ultimate consumption of those resources by end users. Adjustments to the ARO resulting from reassessments of the timing and amount of cash flows will result in changes to the retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset.\nUpon decommissioning of the ARO or a portion thereof, we reduce the fair value of the liability and recognize a (gain) loss on settlement of ARO as an operating item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the difference between the liability and actual decommissioning costs incurred.\nFederal and State Income Taxation\nWe qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and intend to continue to remain so qualified. For further information, see \"Federal and State Income Taxation\" above in this Item 7 and \"Federal and State Income Taxation\" under\n\nItem 5 \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related

At December 31, 2019, CorEnergy had liquidity of $257.3 million. Liquidity was enhanced in 2019 by proceeds from the 5.875% Convertible Note offering, partially offset by cash used to exchange 7.00% Convertible Notes. \n- Cash flows from operations are used to fund obligations, working capital, debt payments, and dividends. Management expects future cash flows plus access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund future requirements.\n\nResults of Operations\n- 2019 vs 2018: Lower lease revenue due to sale of Portland Terminal, offset by higher MoGas transportation revenue. Lower expenses, excluding $34M loss on debt extinguishment. Higher distributions and interest income.\n- 2018 vs 2017: Higher lease and transportation revenue. Gain on sale of Portland Terminal in 2018. Lower income tax benefit in 2018.\n\nCash Flows\n- Higher net cash from operations in 2019 due to lease receipts and MoGas/Omega contributions, partially offset by expenses.\n- Investing activities: 2019 included $5M payment on promissory note from sale of Portland Terminal. 2018 included $56M in sale proceeds.  \n- Financing: 2019 included debt extinguishment cash outflows and dividends paid, partially offset by convertible note offering proceeds. 2018 included dividends paid and preferred stock repurchases.\n\nDebt and Liquidity\n- Had $257M in liquidity at December 31, 2019. \n- 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes issued in August 2019. Additional convertible note transactions during 2019.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n- Impairment evaluations for long-lived assets use undiscounted cash flow projections. No impairments recorded.\n- Recognized existing Asset Retirement Obligation with GIGS acquisition. Reassesses timing and amount of ARO cash flows periodically."}
